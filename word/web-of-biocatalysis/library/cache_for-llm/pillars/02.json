        "intro": "IntroductionReplete with nature's solutions to catalyzing chemical transformations, our burgeoning genomic databases beautifully illustrate how evolution generates chemical innovation in the form of new enzymes. Today's enormous biocatalytic diversity is the product of evolution from ancestral enzymes, the mechanisms of which are now being elucidated in unprecedented detail. Enzyme evolution is also alive and well and moving into the future: new enzymes continue to appear in response to (often man-made) opportunities to survive challenges (e.g. antibiotic resistance) or occupy new niches (e.g. catabolize man-made compounds). Given nature's ability to innovate, and our extremely limited ability to design new enzymes, we argue for using evolutionary strategies to create and tune enzymes fit for human applications.Directed evolution is a powerful protein engineering approach that has been applied with great success for nearly two decades to fine-tune enzymes for chemical synthesis. 1 A simple strategy of accumulating mutations via iterative mutagenesis and screening for desired functions can effectively optimize properties of interest-activity on non-native substrates, enantioselectivity, product selectivity, stability and more-and deftly circumvents our profound ignorance of how the enzyme sequence encodes these features. If chemists are to use enzymes in synthesis, these catalysts have to perform as well as or better than the alternatives. Often this is a high bar that no 'rational design' approach has been able to meet on a regular basis, but one where directed evolution performs well, given a good starting point. 2 As a result, enzymes are increasingly used in chemical synthesis, where they offer significant advantages for 'green' processes 3 , production of chemicals from renewable resources, 4 and synthesis of complex natural products.Directed evolution can be used to diversify existing enzymes, creating variants that function in non-native environments, accept non-native substrates, or exhibit non-native selectivities. But how do we create whole new enzymes, including enzymes that catalyze reactions not known in nature? Nature's catalyst reserve is vast and has not been fully mined; new enzymes will continue to be discovered. Chemists, however, are fond of a number of reactions for which there may well be no natural biocatalytic counterparts, either beca",
        "conclusion": "ConclusionsOver the last fifty years, chemists have invented creative synthetic disconnections that are not found in nature. We believe that at least some of these reactions could be imported into biological systems. The challenge for engineering enzymes to catalyze non-natural chemistry is that there is not another enzyme to provide the inspiration or guide the engineering-that leap has to come from luck (accidental discovery of an interesting promiscuous activity), laborious screening of enzymes for non-natural functions, or, better, from chemical intuition/design based on known synthetic transformations. The carbenoid and nitrenoid transfer reactions catalyzed by engineered cytochrome P450s are a good example of how new enzymes can be generated using an approach that mimics nature and is based on chemical knowledge: work with transition metal catalysts and mechanistic similarities provided the inspiration, the promiscuity of the natural P450 enzymes provided a starting point, and protein engineering/evolution provided the means to tune reactivity and selectivity. Similarly, the various synthetic methods developed for C-N coupling (for which there is no natural counterpart) served as a motivation to investigate an enzymatic equivalent in SyrB2 halogenase.But can every poorly active enzyme be engineered or evolved for high activity? This is clearly not the case. If it were, all weakly active computationally designed enzymes, 79 catalytic antibodies, or bovine serum albumin for that matter could be evolved in the laboratory to be highly efficient. Because we do not yet fully understand the features of an effective scaffold or starting point for the design or evolution of catalysis, 80 we find it prudent to start with enzyme scaffolds that have proven ability to evolve (i.e. have diverged naturally to catalyze different reactions). Experience shows that enzymes like the cytochrome P450s or members of other functionally diverse superfamilies which have already diverged to catalyze many different reactions are also readily evolved in the laboratory, at least when the reactions share mechanistic features. 81 This includes evolution of catalytic activities that have no natural counterpart, such as olefin cyclopropanation with diazo compounds or cyanation via epoxide opening. If one particular enzyme does not exhibit a desired promiscuous activity, other family me",
        "other": "Nature's Approach to Generating New EnzymesCatalytic promiscuity refers to the ability of an enzyme to catalyze, in addition to its native function, reactions that target different functional groups on the substrate and proceed through different transition states and/or reactive intermediates. In 1976, Jensen proposed that ancient enzymes were characterized by broad substrate and reaction scope and that natural selection picked up and fine-tuned these different activities to generate contemporary enzymes with specific catalytic functions (Figure 1A). 5 But even today's enzymes are not as specific as often thought-many can catalyze other transformations in their active sites and exhibit (usually low levels of) catalytic promiscuity. 6 Much evidence now suggests that this often serendipitous catalytic promiscuity is in fact vital to the evolution of new enzymes, providing a platform for evolution of new functions by natural selection (Figure 1B). 7\n\nEvolution of atrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA)The evolution of atrazine chlorohydrolase (AtzA) is one of the best case studies of how nature exploits catalytic promiscuity to create new enzymes. A potent herbicide introduced in the late 1950s, atrazine was initially found to be minimally biodegradable. Since 1993, however, atrazine has been observed to be degraded rapidly by soil microbes in diverse locales, a phenomenon attributed to the presence of the enzyme AtzA. 9 This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the C-Cl bond of atrazine (Figure 2A) through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction with a Fe 2+ -activated water molecule.The amino acid sequence of AtzA from Pseudomonas sp. ADP is 98% identical to that of melamine deaminase (TriA), an enzyme originally isolated from Pseudomonas sp. strain NRRL B-12227. TriA catalyzes the hydrolysis of the C-N bond of melamine, another nonnatural compound that was originally classified as non-biodegradable in the 1930s, but was slightly degradable by the time atrazine was first introduced. 10 The two enzymes differ at only nine out of 475 amino acids. 11 This extremely high level of identity and the fact that both enzymes can be found in at least one common bacterial species suggested that AtzA evolved from TriA or from a common ancestral enzyme similar to TriA (Figure 2B), enabling the bacteria to capitalize on a new opportunity to use these synthetic compounds as nitr"

The rise of structural data, generation of detailed sequence-function maps [1] and computational tools, [2][3][4][5] combined with nextgeneration sequencing technologies, [6] enable scientists to generate smart libraries for directed evolution [7][8][9] and to perform rational engineering or to design new proteins from scratch. [4,5] For example, in deep-mutational scanning (DMS) all residues of a protein are saturation-mutagenized and then functionally characterized, allowing a protein engineer to create detailed sequence-function maps of a protein. [1] These fitness maps can identify structurally or functionally important residues that can then infuse further library design. In the context of enzyme engineering, information-rich sequence-function maps obtained from such methods allowed researchers to probe the relationship between enzyme fitness and solubility, [10] folding [11] and heterologous expression levels, [12] it has been used to identify sequence determinants of enzymatic substrate specificity, [13] and it has been used to create smart libraries for directed evolution. [9] A collection of available DMS data sets is currently consolidated here: https://www.mavedb.org. [14] Further, computational tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) [8] and de novo protein design strategies [5,15] currently revolutionize the way we do protein science. For example, AI has been used to guide and accelerate the pace of directed evolution [2] and has recently been used to predict from mostly database-available sequences which combination of mutations likely yields a functionally optimized protein or enzyme (in respect to a specific user-set function). [3] While these developments will continue to expand the functionality of proteins in general and enzymes specifically, they also demand the creation of massive variant libraries. For instance, to create a DMS library of a 300 amino acid protein, 5701 gene variants (the wildtype sequence plus 19 amino acid exchanges for all 300 positions) need",
        "methods": "Increasing the resolution window of short-read (second-generation) sequencing-based library analysis methodsA method called \"subassembly\" is powerful to overcome the limited read length in NGS as full-length sequences of mutagenized clones can be obtained from short NGS reads. [44] In subassembly, each mutant clone in a complex library is individually coupled to a random molecular tag. Paired-end reads are obtained with one fixed end reporting the tag sequence, and one shotgun end derived randomly from the insert. Shotgun reads are then grouped by tag to yield an accurate full-length consensus haplotype that is longer than the constituent reads and can detect random sequencing errors.",
        "conclusion": "Conclusions and OutlookHere we summarized currently available methods that use cheap but error-prone array-synthesized oligo pools as a source of synthetic DNA for protein engineering libraries. These methods allow the creation of targeted or comprehensive mutagenic libraries required for deep-mutational scanning, directed evolution, or rational protein engineering. Further, they allow the assembly of de novo designed gene libraries of several thousands of genes of up to 700 bp in length as well as the assembly of defined longer genes and pathways (Figure 1A).All methods only require standard molecular biology expertise and equipment to create libraries and relatively standard bioinformatics expertise to analyze the NGS data. As such, they provide affordable access to next-generation protein engineering libraries for many laboratories.Combining the herein outlined methods with newly developed methods for oligo pool purification, [26] should further enhance the capacity of oligo pools for protein and pathway engineering by enhancing the sequence accuracy of assemblies, a major bottle-neck for scale-up.In addition to library creation methods, we highlight how these libraries can be evaluated for quality and coverage using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics (Figure 1B); specifically, we point to newly developed long-read (secondgeneration) sequencing workflows that overcome accuracy and throughput limitations formerly associated with those secondgeneration methods in the context of library quality control. Being able to sequence longer (gene length) fragments with high accuracy and throughput facilitates the quality control and sequence analysis of gene-and pathway length libraries without the need for tiling it into shorter fragments.In summary, in-house array-synthesized oligo pool-based protein library creation and analysis comes of age and can enable many exciting next-generation protein engineering endeavors in many laboratories.",
        "other": "Changing Residues: Oligo Pool-Based Multiple Site-Saturation Mutagenesis and Deep Mutational Scanning LibrariesSite-directed mutagenesis has been foundational to protein and enzyme engineering. While commercially available methods like QuikChange™ have long been available to create targeted libraries that mutate single and multiple residues, next-generation protein engineering technologies require massive parallel changes to a protein sequence. Towards this end, a handful of scalable mutagenesis methods that achieve (near) comprehensive mutagenesis of open reading frames have been developed: PFunkel, [48] Nicking Mutagenesis (NM) [35,36] and programmed allelic series (PALS) [37] are in vitro methods and plasmid recombineering (PR) [41] and CRISPR-enabled trackable Genome engineering (CREATE) [42] are in vivo methods for use in E. coli and the yeast S. cerevisiae.In this review, we highlight those methods (NM, PALS, PR and CREATE), that have been tested to be compatible with the use of array-synthesized oligo pools rather than individually column-synthesized and hand-mixed oligonucleotide pools. Thus, these methods allow for the cost-effective creation of custom libraries. Noteworthy, even though not explicitly tested in a published format, likely, PFunkel [48] would also work with array-synthesized oligo pools as it is the precursor technique for the development of NM.\n\nIn vitro techniques for saturation mutagenesisNicking mutagenesis (NM) allows for the one-pot generation of targeted or comprehensive single-site or multi-site saturation mutagenesis libraries in a single day, using regular molecular biology techniques: It requires routinely prepped plasmid DNA, a pool of oligonucleotides, two nicking restriction endonucleases (Nt.BbvCI and Nb.BbvCI), an exonuclease (Exo III), a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) and a ligase (Taq). The only non-routine requirement is that the plasmid DNA needs to encode the 7 bp BbvCl recognition site, which can be introduced into any plasmid by regular cloning techniques.The workflow of NM starts by selectively degrading one plasmid DNA strand via the nicking restriction endonuclease Nt.BbvCI and exonuclease treatment. The obtained circular single-stranded DNA subsequently serves as the template for primers that encode for the desired mutations. The ratio of primer to template allows tuning the number of mutations per g"

        "intro": "General Model of Enzyme EvolutionHow does a new enzymatic function evolve? In 1970, Maynard Smith published a seminal paper that stated, \"If evolution by natural selection is to occur, functional proteins must form a continuous network which can be traversed by unit mutational steps without passing through non-functional intermediates\" (Smith,'70). In other words, the functional expansion of an enzyme superfamily must occur gradually and smoothly by accumulating adaptive mutations one step at a time and forming a continuous network in sequence space. Therefore, in order to form a continuous network, a foundation for divergence of the new function must pre-exist in the superfamily. The existence of secondary, low-level enzymatic functions and their role in enzyme evolution was first recognized by Jensen ('76). Jensen stated that in ancestral, primitive enzymes, \"Broad substrate specificity provides a kind of biochemical leakiness […], which is exploitable for gain of function\" (Jensen,'76). Indeed, recent studies of the biochemical and biophysical properties of resurrected plausible ancestral genes have supplied experimental support for this theory (Bridgham et al., 2009;Afriat-Jurnou et al., 2012;Huang et al., 2012;Voordeckers et al., 2012;Bar-Rogovsky et al., 2013).Over the last decade, it has been shown that many modern enzymes are also promiscuous (Matsumura and Ellington, 2001;Babtie et al., 2010;Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010). Most, if not all, enzymes can recognize alternative compounds that are related to the native substrate (i.e. differ only in a substituent) and subject them to the same chemical transformation (substrate ambiguity or substrate promiscuity). Furthermore, many extant enzymes catalyze distinct chemical reactions (involving different chemical bonds and/or different transition state geometries) other than the one for which they have evolved (catalytic promiscuity). In some cases, enzyme promiscuity is evidence of the evolutionary connection between members of a superfamily, for example, if the native activity of one enzyme is carried out promiscuously in related homologous enzymes (Roodveldt et al., 2005;Afriat et al., 2006;Vick and Gerlt, 2007;van Loo et al., 2010). In addition, many enzymes can catalyze additional reactions not related to their ancestry or homologues and this serendipitous promiscuity provides further potential starting",

While experimental evolution is artificial and can never perfectly mirror natural evolution, it allows the detailed study of stepwise evolutionary trajectories in response to a simple selection pressure. Thus, experimental evolution has successfully filled a missing link in the study of evolution and provided new insights into evolutionary dynamics, as well as novel methodologies to engineer and evolve proteins efficiently in the laboratory (Harms and Thornton, 2013).In this review, we describe lessons learned from experimental evolution and summarize recent advances in our understanding of evolutionary dynamics, with particular focus on evolutionary constraints. We begin by briefly introducing a general model of enzyme evolution and use the concept of a fitness landscape to depict transitions between enzymatic functions. We discuss a selection of experimental works that identified factors restricting enzyme evolution and highlight examples where such constraints were overcome. These studies combine to advance our understanding of enzyme evolutionary dynamics, which will aid our ability to successfully engineer novel enzymes in the laboratory.\n\nFitness Landscapes to Depict Adaptive ProcessesThe concept of a fitness landscape (adaptive landscape) is useful to visualize adaptive evolutionary processes (Wright, '32;Carneiro and Hartl, 2010). In sequence space, each protein sequence represents one point, and sequences that differ by a single substitution are located next to each other. The sequence space is multidimensional and accordingly complex, for instance, a protein containing 100 amino acid residues occupies 100 dimensions. However, sequence space is frequently compressed into one or two dimensions for simplification and ease of visualization. Strictly speaking, \"fitness\" refers to the reproduction or survival rate of an organism in a certain environment, but any phenotypic property of the protein such as enzymatic activity, stability or cell viability related to protein function (e.g., antibiotic resistance) can be used to construct a fitness landscape. The landscape might be deserted over large areas, a"

Initial protocols mostly focused on the chemical steps(s) through transition state stabilization, whereas most recent approaches exploit the enzyme conformational dynamics often crucial for substrate binding, product release and allosteric regulation. The detailed evaluation of the conformational landscape of many laboratory-evolved enzymes has revealed dramatic changes on the relative stabilities of the conformational states after mutation, favouring those conformational states key for the novel functionality. Of note is that these mutations are often located all around the enzyme structure, which contrasts with most of the computational design strategies that reduce the problem into active site alterations. Recent computational strategies have been developed that consider enzyme design as a population shift problem, i.e. redistribution of the relative stabilities of the conformational states induced by mutations. These strategies focus on reconstructing the conformational landscape of the enzyme, and applying correlation-based tools to elucidate the underlying allosteric network of interactions and identify potential mutation hotspots located at the active site, but most importantly at distal positions for the first time.

        "intro": "INTRODUCTIONEnzyme design focuses on the generation of new biocatalysts with improved properties by altering their natural constituting sequence of aminoacids. The interest in enzyme design arises from their advantageous characteristics, such as their ability to operate under mild biological conditions achieving high efficiency, selectivity and specificity, but also from the intellectual challenge of creating novel enzymatic activities. Enzyme design is a stringent test to understand enzyme catalysis, evolution, folding and stability.Enzymes are typically evolved for catalytic activity, enantioselectivity, thermodynamic stability, substrate specificity, stability in non-aqueous solvents and cosolvents, among other properties. Available enzyme design approaches involve the selection of which residues will be subjected to mutagenesis, generation of new variants, followed by screening protocols to evaluate whether an enhancement in the property of interest is reached. How these different points are targeted classify the available approaches into rational design, [1][2][3] and Directed Evolution (DE). 4,5 Rational design focuses on a selected set of hotspot positions identified based on multiple sequence alignments, the structural analysis of the active site pocket and potential tunnels for substrate binding, and/or in-depth computational modelling of different enzyme properties by means of Quantum Mechanics (QM), Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM), Molecular Dynamics (MD) and MonteCarlo (MC) simulations, among others. 2 Given the vast protein sequence space, rational design reduces the enzyme design problem by usually predicting mutations on the active site pocket or substrate binding tunnels. This contrasts with the powerful DE [6][7][8][9] technique meritoriously awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2018. DE was initially based on iterative cycles of random mutagenesis to improve the selected property of interest, but subsequent improvements were lately introduced based on bioinformatic tools [10][11][12][13][14][15] and sequence analysis 16,17 to generate smarter libraries, protein engineering techniques, 6,18,19 gene synthesis, 20 and sophisticated high-throughput screening techniques. 21 Machine-learning sequence-function models for guiding DE have also been applied. 22,23 The combination of DE with rational computational enzyme design has be",
        "methods": "Correlation-based methods used in allosteric systemsThe first attempts to use graph theory for investigating allosteric regulation focused on the static X-ray structure of the enzyme. 110 In the generated graph, two pairs of nodes (residues) are connected with an edge if the distance between two representative atoms is below a certain threshold. 113 The most important improvement in the graph construction was provided by Sethi and coworkers as they used short MD simulations (of a few ns) to define which nodes were connected and the weights of the edges used. 114 An edge was drawn between a pair of residues (nodes) if the representative atom of each residue was below a certain distance threshold for a specified fraction of the MD simulation time. The edge connecting each pair of residues (i,j) was weighted according to their correlation values (Ci,j, see equations 1 and 2). Those residues that during the MD simulation undergo highly correlated conformational changes (i.e. Ci,j →1), the edge connecting both of them will be rather short (li,j → 0). In the other extreme, those pair of residues whose movement is non-correlated (Ci,j →0) will be connected through rather long edges (li,j → ∞).",
        "conclusion": "ConclusionThe high complexity of enzyme catalysis has led to the development of a variety of computational strategies and protocols that put the focus on a reduced set of the key features of enzymatic catalysis. While initial attempts were mostly focused on the chemical step(s) of the process and overlooked the enzyme conformational dynamics often key for substrate binding and product release, recent computational approaches that based the design efforts into the conformational dynamics have been developed. The importance of considering the enzyme conformational dynamics has been highlighted by rationalizing many laboratory evolution pathways, together with ancestral enzyme reconstruction.The consideration of the enzyme as an ensemble of conformational states converts computational enzyme design into a population shift problem, i.e. predicted mutations should alter the conformational landscape of the enzyme and favour those conformational states key for the novel functionality. However, the identification of which positions might induce the desired conformational shift is not trivial.The detailed study of many laboratory-engineered enzymes through Directed Evolution has also shown that this change in the conformational landscape is often achieved by distal mutations. The key role exerted by remote mutations on the active site of the enzyme suggests that allostery (i.e. regulation of enzyme function by distal positions) might be an intrinsic characteristic of enzymes, which can be exploited for enzyme evolution. Indeed, recently developed computational strategies that focus on the reconstruction of the enzyme conformational landscape have shown that if combined with correlation-based tools, such as the Shortest Path Map (SPM), potential hotspots for altering the conformational landscape and inducing the desired change in function can be identified. This new tool opens the door to new unprecedented computational protocols based on the introduction of active site and also distal mutations, which given the broad sequence space of enzymes are extremely challenging to predict. The evaluation of conformational landscapes and the elucidation of the complex enzymatic network of interactions could potentially bring the computational enzyme design one step forward.",

The distance from the active site of each mutation is marked with a sphere.\n\nENZYME CATALYSIS AND DESIGN: WHICH FEATURES SHOULD BE OPTIMISED TOWARDS NOVEL FUNCTION?Enzymes present a highly pre-organised active site that precisely arrange the catalytic residues for efficiently stabilizing the transition state(s) of the reaction. [40][41][42][43][44] Apart from the chemical step, the enzyme should also properly bind the substrate in the active site pocket, and release the product for starting again the catalytic cycle. These are essential steps in enzyme catalysis that often require the exploration of additional thermally accessible conformations of the enzyme. These additional conformations sometimes involve changes in loops and flexible domains gating the active site access. 45,46 Although highly debated, some studies suggest a direct link between active site dynamics and catalysis of the chemical step of the reaction. 40,[47][48][49][50] Whether there exists such connection or not, there is multiple evidence to the fact that enzymes change conformation along the catalytic cycle, and in some cases conformational change is what limits the process. 51,52 Studies also suggest that evolvability of enzymes is related to their inherent conformationally rich dynamic nature. 53 Therefore, enzymes present a precisely arranged active site pocket, but also a high degree of flexibility and versatility, as shown by their ability to catalyse additional side reactions (i.e. promiscuous reactions), 54 and also their tolerance to evolve towards novel functions either by natural or laboratory evolution. 1,36,53,55,56 Figure 2.

The family shuffling method was applied for in vitro directed evolution to construct a mutant library of GlcDH genes. Three GlcDHcoding genes from Bacillus licheniformis IFO 12200, Bacillus megaterium IFO 15308 and Bacillus subtilis IFO 13719 were each cloned by direct PCR amplification into the pTrc99A expression vector and expressed in the host, Escherichia coli. In addition to these three GlcDH genes, a gene encoding a previously obtained GlcDH mutant, F20 (Q252L), derived from B. megaterium IWG3, was also subjected to directed evolution by the family shuffling method. A highly thermostable mutant, GlcDH DN-46, was isolated in the presence or absence of NaCl after the second round of family shuffling and filter-based screening of the mutant libraries. This mutant had only one novel additional amino acid residue exchange (E170K) compared to F20, even though DN-46 was obtained by family shuffling of four different GlcDH genes. The effect of temperature and pH on the stability of the GlcDH mutants F20 and DN46 was investigated with purified enzymes in the presence or absence of NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, F20 showed very poor thermostability (half-life =1.3 min at 66C), while the half-life of isolated mutant DN-46 was 540 min at 66C, i.e., 415fold more thermostable than mutant F20. The activity of the wild-type and F20 enzymes dropped critically when the pH value was changed to the alkaline range in the absence of NaCl, but no such decrease was apparent with the DN-46 enzyme in the absence of NaCl.",

        "intro": "IntroductionGlucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH,E.C. 1.1.1.47) from Bacillus megaterium IWG3, a tetrameric enzyme with four identical subunits (28.24 kDa), catalyzes the oxidation of d-glucose to d-glucono-d-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD + or NADP + (Jany et al. 1984;Makino et al. 1989) and is a member of the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (Jörnvall et al. 1995). A distinguishable feature of this enzyme is the dissociation of the tetramer into inactive monomers when the pH becomes alkaline; monomers can be reversibly reassembled into the fully active tetramer when the pH value is lowered to 6.5 (Pauly and Pfleiderer 1977;Maurer andPfleiderer 1985, 1987). The addition of 2 M NaCl prevents this alkaline dissociation, thereby stabilizing the oligomeric structure of the tetramer. GlcDH is of interest for the quantitative determination of glucose in blood or other fluids by a single-step assay, and is thus applied in clinical tests and in the food industry. GlcDH is also useful for the enzymatic synthesis of such chiral compounds as ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate and ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, in which GlcDH from B. megaterium has been successfully used as a cofactor (NAD + ) regenerator (Kataoka et al. 1998(Kataoka et al. , 1999;;Kizaki et al. 2001). Thus, considerable efforts have been made to enhance the stability of GlcDH (Makino et al. 1989;Nagao et al. 1989). It has been shown in these studies that the substitution of one amino acid in GlcDH mutants obtained by random chemical mutagenesis could stabilize them against thermal inactivation. The substitution of Glu-96 by Gly (E96G) or Ala (E96A) prevented alkaline dissociation of the oligomeric active tetramer. These mutants thereby showed thermal stability even in the alkaline pH range without NaCl. Notwithstanding the increased stability of these mutants in the absence of NaCl, the stabilization of these mutants was compromised by a loss of catalytic activity to about half that of native GlcDH (77 or 90 U/mg vs 179 U/mg). While mutant F20, in which Gln-252 was replaced by Leu (Q252L), exhibited improved thermostability without compromising its catalytic activity (170 U/mg), it was still easily inactivated by a thermal treatment and also in an alkaline solution in the absence of NaCl (Makino et al. 1989;Nagao et al. 1989).

        "discussion": "DiscussionWe have described in this report the isolation of GlcDH mutants that exhibited significantly enhanced stability regardless of the presence of NaCl without any loss of catalytic activity. In order to obtain a higher frequency of recombination by family shuffling, we constructed a chimeric library by the family shuffling method with randomly cleaved fragments of four GlcDHs. However, the constructed library did not possess a high crossover rate among the four GlcDH genes by using the DNase I method. This low yield of crossover formation has been frequently reported (Zhao and Arnold 1997;Kikuchi et al. 1999), and it was noted that the accumulation rate of point mutations was very low. In our analysis, however, most of the shuffled products had an average of eight nucleotide mutations per gene, demonstrating that the mutation rate was very high. It thus seems that this unusually high mutation rate after two rounds of the family shuffling procedure made it possible to isolate significantly improved thermostable mutant DN-46. DN-46, the most stable isolate, had only two amino substitutions -E170K and Q252L -compared to wild type GlcDH from B. megaterium IWG3, in addition to several silent mutations. This isolate had a half-life at 66C that was 415 times longer than that of the previously obtained most thermostable parental enzyme, F20, and this thermostability was not affected by the NaCl concentration. Moreover, DN-46 had almost the same specific activity (172 U mg 1 ) as that of the wild-type enzyme (179 U mg 1 ) and F20 mutant (170 U mg 1 ), indicating no unfavorable effects resulting from the dramatically increased thermostability. This result can be explained by the crystal structure of wild-type GlcDH recently determined with NAD + at a 1.7 resolution (Yamamoto et al. 2001).According to this three-dimensional structure, the activity site is far from these two mutations, explaining why the catalytic activity in the mutation was not altered by replacing these two amino acids, even with its greatly increased stability. The two changed amino acids, E170K and Q252L, in DN-46 are located at the subunit-subunit interface, which is unusually wide in GlcDH, leading to lower stability than that of other short-chain dehydroge- Table 3 Substrate specificity of wild type and mutant GlcDH Enzyme Glucose Galactose Xylose Maltose Sucrose Fructose Mannose Wild type",

T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and NAD + was purchased from Oriental Yeast (Osaka, Japan), all other chemicals being purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan).

Genomic DNA of the strains isolated from these cultures, and GlcDH genes of these strains were PCR amplified with the oligonucleotide primer pairs shown in Table 1.

A distinguishable feature of this enzyme is the dissociation of the tetramer into inactive monomers when the pH becomes alkaline; monomers can be reversibly reassembled into the fully active tetramer when the pH value is lowered to 6.5 (Pauly and Pfleiderer 1977;Maurer andPfleiderer 1985, 1987).",

Either nature does not care about the specific products, or if she does, she has adopted a different synthetic strategy. In many cases, the appropriate reagents used by synthetic chemists are not readily accessible to biological systems. Here, we discuss our efforts to expand the catalytic repertoire of enzymes to encompass powerful reactions previously known only in small-molecule catalysis: formation and transfer of reactive carbene and nitrene intermediates leading to a broad range of products, including products with bonds not known in biology. In light of the structural similarity of iron carbene (FeC(R 1 )(R 2 )) and iron nitrene (FeNR) to the iron oxo (FeO) intermediate involved in cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation, we have used synthetic carbene and nitrene precursors that biological systems have not encountered and repurposed P450s to catalyze reactions that are not known in the natural world. The resulting protein catalysts are fully genetically encoded and function in intact microbial cells or cell-free lysates, where their performance can be improved and optimized by directed evolution. By leveraging the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes, we evolved a range of carbene and nitrene transferases exhibiting excellent activity toward these new-to-nature reactions. Since our initial report in 2012, a number of other heme proteins including myoglobins, protoglobins, and cytochromes c have also been found and engineered to promote unnatural carbene and nitrene transfer. Due to the altered active-site environments, these heme proteins often displayed complementary activities and selectivities to P450s. Using wild-type and engineered heme proteins, we and others have described a range of selective carbene transfer reactions, including cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, Si-H insertion, B-H insertion, and C-H insertion. Similarly, a variety of asymmetric nitrene transfer processes including aziridination, sulfide imidation, C-H amidation, and, most recently, C-H amination have been demonstrated. The scopes of these biocatalytic carbene and nitrene transfer reactions are often complementary to the state-of-the-art processes based on small-molecule transition-metal catalysts, making engineered biocatalysts a valuable addition to the synthetic chemist's toolbox.

        "intro": "■ INTRODUCTIONNature's malleable protein catalysts, enzymes, are capable of facilitating highly demanding transformations with exquisite control. [5][6][7] A significant fraction of enzymes assemble and exploit metal ions for catalysis. These metalloenzymes catalyze some of the most challenging biological reactions, including photosynthesis, 8 nitrogen fixation, 9 methane oxidation 10 and methylmalonyl-CoA isomerization, 11 with unique reactivity not observed in small-molecule organometallic complexes or enzymes based on purely organic cofactors.Our laboratory has been fascinated by enzymes of the ironcontaining cytochromes P450 (CYPs) family for decades. P450s constitute a subset of hemoproteins using the heme prosthetic group for their native functions. 12,13 Found in all kingdoms of life, P450s catalyze extraordinary oxygenation reactions under exceptionally mild conditions. [14][15][16] In these P450-catalyzed oxidation reactions, a Fe(IV)O porphyrin radical cation species (compound I) is the key oxidizing intermediate for oxene transfer reactions. 17 Nature has tamed this intermediate and diversified its reactivity for a vast array of oxidative transformations.Using P450BM3 from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1), 18 a self-sufficient P450 naturally fused to its diflavin redox partner, our group [19][20][21][22][23] and others 12,18,24,25 have engineered highly active P450 variants for the oxidation of simple alkanes and other organic substrates (Scheme 1). Starting a decade ago, our group became interested in expanding the already immense catalytic repertoire of P450s to encompass reactions not known in the biological world. Inspiration came from two sources: (1) Evolution does itnew activities arose during P450 evolution, and there was no reason to think that further innovation was not possible using evolutionary engineering methods. (2) Creative chemists had already shown that the heme cofactor and various derivatives can catalyze reactions not known in nature. [26][27][28][29] We reasoned that some of these should be available to the heme cofactor embedded in a protein, and that directed evolution could be used to draw out these latent functions.Of special interest to us were the myriad carbene [30][31][32][33] and nitrene [34][35][36] transfer reactions that synthetic chemists had developed.

Despite the abundance of silicon in nature, enzymes capable of Scheme 12. P411-Catalyzed Cyclopropenation of Terminal Aliphatic Alkynes and Internal Alkynes (2018 and 2020) Accounts of Chemical Research pubs.acs.org/accounts Articlecatalyzing the construction of carbon-silicon bonds are not known. 73 Prior art in metal-carbene chemistry demonstrated that the insertion of metal carbenoids into Si-H bonds could lead to the construction of C-Si bonds. We recognized that, by repurposing heme proteins to catalyze the carbenoid insertion into Si-H bonds, we could develop a biocatalytic system to forge Si-C bonds.We were particularly interested in the Si-H insertion of α,αdisubstituted diazo compounds because the use of such carbenoid precursors would engender a stereogenic center at the α-carbon (Scheme 14). Although P450s were ineffective in inducing appreciable enantiodifferentiation, we found that Rhodothermus marinus cytochrome c (Rma cyt c) afforded the Si-H insertion product with excellent enantioselectivity (97% ee, 44 TTN). 2 Even though Rma cyt c's native function is not catalysis, its solvent-exposed heme center apparently accommodates carbenoids bearing two large α-substituents, thus permitting their selective transformation. Further active-site engineering ultimately gave a triple mutant Rma cyt c V75T M100D M103E (\"TDE\") that catalyzed the Si-H insertion with 1518 TTN and >99% ee. It tolerated a range of hydrosilane substrates, giving rise to enantioenriched silanes with outstanding enantiocontrol (Scheme 15). More recently, using machine-learning-assisted directed evolution, we engineered an orthogonal set of RmaNOD biocatalysts to access either the (S)or the (R)-enantiomeric product. 74 Similar to silicon, biosynthetic machineries to form carbonboron bonds were also not known. Furthermore, enantiopure organoboron compounds are coveted synthetic intermediates in organic synthesis, since well-established stereospecific transformations of these species allow access to a wide range of medicinally relevant scaffolds. Encouraged by our success in Si-H insertion, we embarked on the development of biocatalysts for enantioselective B-H insertion (Scheme 16). 75 Using Nheterocyclic carbene (NHC)"

        "intro": "■ INTRODUCTIONThe number of biocatalytic applications in the pharmaceutical industry continues to increase as new engineered and processproven enzymes become available. 1,2 Biocatalysis is often associated within the context of API manufacturing, but there are also clear benefits of applying biocatalysis at the discovery phase. For example, stereoselective reactions, synthesis optimization, and the functionalization of new lead compounds can be achieved using enzymes with the same benefits of selectivity and stereospecificity. However, applying enzymes to non-natural reactions usually requires some level of enzyme engineering. As such, time-efficient engineering strategies are therefore needed to access sufficiently active and stable biocatalysts. The use of physics-inspired computational models to engineer enzyme activity is a promising way to rapidly improve enzymes. 3 However, the accuracy of the design process still needs improvement to be able to create highly active enzymes from scratch. [4][5][6][7] Machine learning models trained on large data sets combined with directed evolution, hereby termed machine-directed evolution, have been proven to be able to predict sequence-activity-relationships and have the potential to help navigate enzyme sequence space more efficiently. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] Despite the increasing popularity of research in machine learning and enzyme engineering, a direct experimental comparison between directed evolution and machinedirected evolution has only been reported once. 20 Arguments in favor of machine-directed evolution have been based on either (1) fully randomly mutating a highly constrained subset of positions, 11 (2) making comparisons against a well-studied protein of academic interest, 10 or (3) conducting counterfactual simulation studies. 11 Additionally, most studies have only optimized a single property of interest, whereas in an industrially relevant situation multiple properties may need to be optimized simultaneously. There may not be high-quality structural data immediately available, and the enzymatic mechanism can depend on both cofactors and the amino acids in the active site. We were interested in operating in a generalized environment without these biases to reflect the goals of biocatalysis in an industrial context.A suitable test case to compare experimental directed evolution",
        "results": "■ RESULTSGenome Mining. The first goal was to identify a (wild type) IRED capable of catalyzing the reductive amination between the Cbz-protected 3-oxopyrrolidine and methylamine (Supporting Information (SI), Biocatalytic reactions). Several literature enzymes catalyzed the reaction, and both (S)-and (R)-selective catalysts were identified. This was also in line with the previous literature, where AspRedAm catalyzed the analogous reaction of a Boc-protected oxopyrrolidine. 30 However, when we tested the bulkier ketone 1 (Figure 1a), which would give direct access to amine 2, only two enzymes from our in-house panel catalyzed the reaction. From this panel, the most (R)-selective enzyme was IRED-22 from Mycobacterium mageritense (WP_036431480.1). 26 This wild type enzyme catalyzed the reaction with a moderate conversion (12%) while exhibiting a good enantioselectivity (ee (R) 97%). IRED-13 26 (WP_046711811.1) was (S)-selective (>99%) and gave a higher conversion (77%) than IRED-22.Since naturally occurring imine reductases are mineable from sequence databases, 25,28,31,32 we embarked on genome mining to search for a wild type IRED with a higher activity toward the desired (R)-enantiomer 27 (Figure 1). The first round focused on building a versatile imine reductase panel, relying on a hidden Markov model (HMM, Supporting Information) clustering approach based on active site sequence features and a selection of 96 representatives from the clusters to be expressed and tested. From the first round, our most (R)selective wild type, IRED-88, gave an increased conversion (70%) toward the target reaction; however, it unfortunately gave a decreased selectivity (ee (R) 30%) when compared to that of IRED-22. The second round of mining in which we specifically looked for IREDs similar to IRED-22 and IRED-88 led to an improved catalyst compared to IRED-22 and IRED-88, namely, IRED-88-2 (83% conversion and ee (R) > 99%), demonstrating the power of genome mining when identifying starting points for enzyme evolution. To evaluate the machinedirected evolution, we selected IRED-88 as it provided an opportunity to engineer both the activity and the enantioselectivity. In the high-throughput conditions, where the enzymes were expressed and screened in 384-well micro titer plates, wells expressing IRED-88 yielded approximately 10%",
        "discussion": "■ DISCUSSIONEngineering Imine Reductases. Genome mining efforts from multiple academic and industrial research groups have provided a rich set of wild type enzymes to the community. 35 These enzyme panels provide access to a broad substrate scope, even for bulky compounds, and high (S)-and (R)selectivities are observed. Based on our experience, the reaction rates and stabilities of these wild type enzymes are often insufficient for medicinal chemistry-scale applications. Enzyme engineering reports to address the reaction efficiencies of IREDs have recently started to emerge. 23,36,37 Researchers at GSK engineered an IRED toward a better efficiency in kilogram-scale process conditions. They targeted the enzyme's pH tolerance, increased the substrate load, and reduced the enzyme load. 23 The selected wild type, IR-46, already exhibited perfect enantioselectivity, which was retained over the course of evolution. The substrate load was doubled from 10.5 to 20.1 g/L. The higher substrate load corresponds to 67 mM, which the engineered mutant M3 converted by 95.6%. Xu et al. improved the reaction rate of their IRED, IR1, 12-fold with two mutations. This double mutant facilitated a 100 mM reaction with an 86% isolated yield. 36 Perfect enantioselectivity of the wild type enzyme was also retained in this case. In the third example, Yang et al. could increase the substrate tolerance of an IRED by a rational approach in which two bulky residues, W191 and F190, aligned at the bottom of the enzyme's substrate binding pocket were mutated into smaller residues. 37 Again, the already perfect (S)-stereoselectivity of the wild type was retained. These examples are encouraging because they demonstrate that activity improvements in IREDs are feasible by applying various engineering strategies, even with just a few mutations.The available IRED panels provided sufficient sequence information for a hidden Markov model to be built to find new wild type IREDs. In this present study, machine learning models were not employed in the initial selection of IRED-88 as a starting scaffold. However, machine learning models could be considered for other enzyme classes and target reactions, and a major future opportunity for machine learning in protein science (in the same spirit as CASP 38 ) is to find families of potential enzyme matches for an arbitrary reaction. Such work is emerging 39 ",
        "conclusion": "■ CONCLUSIONConsidering the data presented in this study, we believe that machine-directed evolution is an effective part of an enzyme engineer's toolkit. Simple linear additivity, arising from combining effective individual mutations outside the active site, may help explain a large fraction of the effectiveness of machine-directed evolution.From this research, we conclude that machine-directed evolution has its own sweet spot in enzyme evolution applications. This study contributes to showing its potential to efficiently explore a large sequence space. To engineer an enzyme to have a desired property, multiple evolution strategies are possible, and the choice of strategy depends on the available resources. We predict that machine-directed evolution will become a standard process in the enzyme engineer's toolbox.",
        "methods": "■ MATERIALS AND METHODSMutant Libraries and Synthetic Genes. Wild type imine reductase genes, including IRED-88, and machine-directed mutants were synthesized and cloned into pET28a by Genscript using either NdeI/XhoI or HindIII/XhoI cloning strategies. A deep mutational scanning library was constructed by Twist Bioscience (San Francisco, CA). Error-prone PCR was utilized to generate between 1 and 4 mutations per mutant clone using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a template, 100 ng of plasmid DNA was. Primers were ordered from Microsynth (reverse 5′-GGTGGTGCTCGAGTTAGG-3′ and forward 5′-GGCAGCCATATGACTAATCAC-3′). PCR was run with 30 cycles, an annealing temperature of 55 °C, and an elongation time of 75 s. PCR products containing NdeI and XhoI restriction sites were cloned into pET28a using the Rapid DNA Ligation Kit (Roche) according to themanufacturer's instructions. All genes and mutant libraries were electroporated overnight into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen or New England Biolabs) and cultured on LB (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 0.5 g/L NaCl, pH 7.0) agar that contained 50 μg/mL kanamycin sulfate at 37 °C.High Throughput Expression and Assay. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants were picked in 384 flat-bottom microtiterplates (Greiner) prefilled with 40 μL of the MDAG-135 medium (2 mM MgSO 4 , 25 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 50 mM NH 4 Cl, 5 mM Na 2 SO 4 , 0.1% aspartate, 25 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0.35% (w/v) glucose, 50 μM FeCl 3 , 20 μM CaCl 2 , 10 μM MnCl 2 , 10 μM ZnSO 4 , 2 μM CoCl 2 , 2 μM CuCl 2 , and 2 μM NiCl 2 ; 200 μg/mL of each standard amino acid without cysteine and tyrosine) that was supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) using the MegaPix II colony picker (Genetix, Molecular Devices).

We therefore decided to target a 10-fold improvement in conversion, which translates to full conversion in the high-throughput screening conditions and perfect stereoselectivity (ee (R) > 99%). Due to the respective throughput of each of the two assays, we first prioritized activity, then analyzed the enantioselectivity of only those variants that had improved conversions as compared to that of the wild type IRED-88. Deep Mutational Scanning. A deep mutational scanning (DMS) library (Figure 2a), containing all 19 amino acid replacements with a single substitution at each individual position of the IRED-88 sequence, was ordered as synthetic DNA, cloned into pET28a(+), transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and expressed in 384-well micro titer plates. The cell mass was harvested and chemically lysed, and the supernatants were used to assay the reductive amination of ketone 1 (5 mM) using methylamine and a GDH/glucosebased NADPH-regeneration system. The reaction conversions were analyzed using RapidFire mass spectrometry. We were able to systematically map out the sequence-activity landscape for 82% of all possible DMS mutants of IRED-88 (Figure 2a). The enzyme activities spanned four orders of magnitude on our measurement scale, from inactive enzymes (in black) to enzymes with increased activity (in yellow). The empirical cumulative distribution of activities from the library (Figure 2b) showed that most of our variants harbored mutations that destroyed the enzymatic activity. As expected, proline had a general knockout effect on enzyme activity due to its rigidity . The x-axis shows the position on linear amino acid sequence, the y-axis shows the identity of the substituted amino acid ordered alphabetically from top to bottom, and the color is the activity (on a logarithmic scale). Activity units are in fractions, with 1.0 corresponding to 100% conversion and 0 corresponding to 0% conversion. White cells in the heatmap either are variants that we could not measure due to cloning difficulties or correspond to the wild-type sequence.

      "abstract": "Directed evolution experiments designed to improve the activity of a biocatalyst have increased in sophistication from the early days of completely random mutagenesis. Sequence-based and structure-based methods have been developed to identify \"hotspot\" positions that when randomized provide a higher frequency of beneficial mutations that improve activity. These focused mutagenesis methods reduce library sizes and therefore reduce screening burden, accelerating the rate of finding improved enzymes. Looking for further acceleration in finding improved enzymes, we investigated whether two existing methods, one sequence-based (Protein GPS) and one structurebased (using Bioluminate and MOE), were sufficiently predictive to provide not just the hotspot position, but also the amino acid substitution that improved activity at that position. By limiting the libraries to variants that contained only specific amino acid substitutions, library sizes were kept to less than 100 variants. For an initial round of ATA-117 R-selective transaminase evolution, we found that the methods used produced libraries where 9% and 18% of the amino acid substitutions chosen were amino acids that improved reaction performance in lysates . The ability to create combinations of mutations as part of the initial design was confounded by the relatively large number of predicted mutations that were inactivating (30% and 45% for the sequence-based and structure-based methods respectively). Despite this, combining several mutations identified within a given method produced variant lysates 7 and 9 fold more active than the wild type lysate, highlighting the capability of mutations chosen this way to generate large advances in activity in addition to the reductions in screening. KEYWORDS directed evolution / in silico mutagenesis / R-specific transaminase ATA-117 / Bioluminate / MOE / Protein GPS ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Synthetic Biology 3 Directed Evolution has become a foundational technology for improving a wide variety of enzyme properties, of which activity and selectivity are the two most notable for industrial biocatalysis. The technology initiated in the early 1990s as a Nature-inspired approach to improve enzyme function through random mutation of the protein's amino acid sequence and screening for desired effect. 1Over the intervening years, Directed Evolution has become more sophisticated, 2 such that today, several strategies exist that enable practitioners to reduce the randomness of the initial approach by making educated guesses as to the location of mutations likely to be responsible for improvement of activity or selectivity, which has been extensively reviewed. [3][4][5][6][7][8] By limiting the random mutations to a subset of well-chosen amino acid residues (often called \"hotspots\") rather than the entire protein, the pool of variant sequences decreases dramatically, reducing the number of screening samples required to identify improved enzymes, giving rise to the name \"small, but smart\" libraries and accelerating evolution projects often limited by screening efforts. Being able to move activity and selectivity quickly in early rounds of directed evolution experiments by increasing the magnitude of improvement, decreasing the time of each round, or both is critically important to delivering on the promise of industrial biocatalysis. 9 When the method for mutation selection is well suited to the desired property improvement, such as the FRESCO method for stability, large changes in performance can be made in extremely small libraries. 10 The strategies for generating small, but smart libraries for improved activity focus generally on two fundamental approaches to identify hotspots. The first uses the large collections of sequence information in enzyme sequence databases to identify and catalog natural diversity under the presumption that natural evolution has sampled a significant amount of mutation space and identified the critical residues, their key interactions with substrates and each other, and that the prediction of hotspots can be inferred from an analysis of these data. 5,6,11,12 The second approach uses 3-dimensional protein structural information combined with an understanding of the substrate, transition state or product binding within the enzyme active site to identify residues likely to control reaction progress. 6,7,13 A recent advancement highlights the combination of tools from both ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Synthetic Biology 25 distibution anlaysis of mutations; recombination methodology for generating round 2 sequences; round 2 screening results and deconvolution of mutations; evaluation of sequence and structure method orthogonality.",

        "results": "RESULTS & DISCUSSIONThe sequence-based strategy used multiple sequence alignments of 1250 homologues of the ATA-117 gene to identify ~1900 natural variations as diversity potentially useful for substitution. Using ATUM's Protein GPS Engineering technology as described in the Methods section, 66 unique mutations (Table 4, Methods Section) were prioritized for evaluation and arranged into 95 sequences. One of the advantages of this small library approach is that the relatively few number of samples allows for more detailed data collection to provide higher quality data overall. In this case, it allowed for quantitation of enzyme expression in each lysate, providing information on a significant source of variability and enabling access to higher quality specific activity data. Under the screening conditions where the substrate concentration is much less than the K M , the specific activity data is a scaled measurement of an apparent catalytic efficiency (k cat /K M ) app for this reaction. This sequence-based Round 1 (R1) library was arranged with 3 mutations per sequence (allowing each mutation to be observed in 5 different variants, SI-Table S1) under the premise that the prescreening of these mutations in homologous sequences in Nature would provide a high degree of tolerability in the resulting variant set. Screening this sequenced-based R1 library (SI-Figure S1A) identified 3 lysates with more activity than the wild type lysate, including the best variant comprised of mutations I84L, F122Y and S223P that was 4.6 fold improved in total activity, 3.9 fold improved in specific activity and 1.2 fold improved in expression (Figure S1B, Table S2). Twelve additional variants had specific activities between 1.2-fold and 2.2 fold improved relative to wild type, although expression of these variants was sufficiently poor that total activity was reduced relative to the wild type lysate.The premise that the pre-screening of substitutions in Nature would provide a majority of well tolerated substitutions and ensure reasonable activity in the collection did not hold for this library. This is a direct result of having every mutation seen in 5 variants -if a given mutation is deleterious, 5 inactive variants are expected. Sixty-three of the 95 variant sequences displayed activity below the threshold of detection and were deemed inactive. Of these, 39 sequences had low exp",
        "conclusion": "CONCLUSIONThe ultimate solution to the directed evolution improvement of an enzyme with some initial activity on a non-natural, industrially-relevant substrate should be to examine sources of mutational diversity and through some scientific algorithm, simply re-write the amino acid sequence with the new substitutions that will render the enzyme suitably effective -screening one or at most a few variants for confirmation of the desired activity. While this goal appears impossible, great strides have already been made in this direction. Starting from the Nature-inspired technique of random mutagenesis and screening of 10,000 variants, many scientists have moved to smart libraries that identify smaller subsets of amino acid positions that are randomly mutated (\"site directed, random substitutions\") that reduce the screening burden to the order of 1,000 variants. Here we scouted the next advance -we examined two existing methods for determining \"site directed, specific substitutions\" that successfully identified mutations that improve the ATA-117 transaminase's activity on a non-natural substrate, each while examining on the order of 100 variants. The two orthogonal methods, one based on the evaluation of sequence alignments and the other on structure-based in silico prediction provided hit rates of 1 positive variant for every 11 and 5.5 mutations predicted, respectively. These frequencies are already valuable from a directed evolution perspective, rapidly enabling 7-and 9-fold improvements in transaminase activity by taking advantage of recombination strategies. Additionally, subsets of the structure-based in silico prediction data reached 1 positive variant in every 2 sequences. By combining these two enzyme design approaches, the orthogonal diversity generated here could potentially serve as a way to accelerate an evolution campaign by limiting the number of variants to screen in each round and by reducing the number of rounds necessary to achieve a desired fold improvement. Improving the predictive science of both methods through better analysis of sequence information and improved computational techniques should lead to significant improvements in evolving enzyme activity in a small number of screening samples, and very large improvements in single rounds of evolution when traditional screening efforts are applied.",
        "methods": "MATERIALS AND METHODSA sequence-based library consisting of 95 variant sequences and one wild type control was designed by ATUM through their proprietary Protein GPS Engineering technology (sequence-based R1), similar to the imagabalin transaminase effort. 34 This method relies on sequence alignments from a large collection of homologues and their own algorithms to identify specific amino acid substitutions to investigate. 18 In brief, multiple sequence alignments of 1250 homologues were performed to identify natural diversity as pre-vetted accepted mutations. An analysis of the mutations in conjunction with the associated pattern of site-specific and branch-specific variations was performed using a phylogenetic tree generated from the alignment, as previously described in detail, 35 resulting in a numerical scoring of each observed mutation related to its acceptability in the sequence. All possible substitutions (~1900 in this case) seen in the alignment were ranked ordered and a set of 250 were identified as candidate mutations for the directed evolution process. The 66 highest ranking mutations were selected for evaluation in Round 1 (Table 4). Because of the conservative nature of these mutations, 3 substitutions were evaluated simultaneously in each sequence. Substitutions were grouped such that each mutation was seen 5 times in the collection of 95 variants, each time with a different context of partnered substitutions. 22 Thus, all substitutions are equally represented in the designed variants with no random mutations. From this design ATUM then created the DNA sequences, expressed the enzyme variants and produced clarified lysates, 36 which were then screened on THTP-BDO and analyzed as described below.Each of the constructs made was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Agilent). Transformants were selected on LB agar with 30mg/L kanamycin at 37 º C.

A number of degenerate codon sets have also been developed to limit bias and control redundancy in the genetic code and in some cases to reduce the overall amino acids sampled to keep screening effort to a minimum. 4,11 These and other strategies for generating \"small, but smart\" libraries narrow search space for improved variants from many thousands to several hundreds of variants screened. 7,[17][18][19][20] Although the reduced degree of randomness in the pool of variants construction limits the screening burden, it still creates theoretically unnecessary screening.Screening could be maximally accelerated if the correct amino acid substitution could also be inferred from the hotspot analysis. We were interested in understanding how close current methodologies are to correctly identifying valuable amino acid substitutions in addition to hotspot position.Small, but smart libraries were used in what was then (circa 2008) the state-of-the-art directed evolution effort of a transaminase to synthesize sitagliptin, including the initial round of substrate walking that was designed to bridge the substrate scope of the (R)-selective transaminase ATA-117 with the desired sitagliptin molecule. 21 This initial round screened for activity improvements against a truncated ketone analog of sitagliptin (1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro- [1,2,4]triazolo [4,3-a]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl)butane-1,3-dione, abbreviated THTP-BDO, Scheme 1) and examined site-SCHEME 1 saturation mutagenesis to randomize the amino acids at 12 positions, resulting in the identification 8 positions where at least 1 amino acid substitution improved reaction rate. Since this work was done, predictive tools have improved with continued development of sequence alignment analyses (3DM, ATUM (formerly DNA2.0), HotSpot Wizard) alongside the expansion of sequences in the databases, and with improved structural computational capabilities.Here we re-investigated this initial round of sitaglip"

The technology initiated in the early 1990s as a Nature-inspired approach to improve enzyme function through random mutation of the protein's amino acid sequence and screening for desired effect. 1Over the intervening years, Directed Evolution has become more sophisticated, 2 such that today, several strategies exist that enable practitioners to reduce the randomness of the initial approach by making educated guesses as to the location of mutations likely to be responsible for improvement of activity or selectivity, which has been extensively reviewed. [3][4][5][6][7][8] By limiting the random mutations to a subset of well-chosen amino acid residues (often called \"hotspots\") rather than the entire protein, the pool of variant sequences decreases dramatically, reducing the number of screening samples required to identify improved enzymes, giving rise to the name \"small, but smart\" libraries and accelerating evolution projects often limited by screening efforts.",

By screening genomic libraries prepared from environmental samples collected around the globe, we recently discovered over 200 unique nitrilases that allow mild and selective hydrolysis of organonitriles to carboxylic acid derivatives. 3 Several enzymes were shown to be effective for enantioselective hydrolysis of hydroxynitriles to produce Rand β-hydroxy acids on small reaction scale.

        "intro": "Biocatalysis is the application of enzymes and microbes in synthetic chemistry, and uses nature's catalysts for new purposes: applications for which enzymes have not evolved [1][2][3][4][5] . The field of biocatalysis has reached its present industrially proven level through several waves of technological research and innovations.During the first wave of biocatalysis (Fig. 1), which started more than a century ago, scientists recognized that components of living cells could be applied to useful chemical transformations (in contrast to the fermentation processes, which had been commonplace for millennia already). For example, Rosenthaler synthesized (R)-mandelonitrile from benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide using a plant extract 6 ; hydroxylation of steroids 7 occurring within microbial cells was also known. More recent examples are the use of proteases in laundry detergents 8 , glucose isomerase to convert glucose to the sweeter-tasting fructose 9 , and penicillin G acylase to make semisynthetic antibiotics 10 . The main challenge for these applications is the limited stability of the biocatalyst, and such shortcomings were primarily overcome by immobilization of the enzyme, which also facilitated the reuse of the enzyme.During the second wave of biocatalysis, in the 1980s and 1990s, initial protein engineering technologies, typically structure based, extended the substrate range of enzymes to allow the synthesis of unusual synthetic intermediates. This change expanded biocatalysis to the manufacture of pharmaceutical intermediates and fine chemicals. Examples include the lipase-catalysed resolution of chiral precursors for synthesis of diltiazem (a blood pressure drug), hydroxynitrile-lyase-catalysed synthesis of intermediates for herbicides 11 , carbonyl-reductase-catalysed synthesis of enantiopure alcohols for cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, lipasecatalysed synthesis of wax esters such as myristyl myristate or cetyl ricinoleate for cosmetics 12 , and nitrile-hydratase-catalysed hydration of acrylonitrile to acrylamide for polymers 13 (where nitrile hydratase was obtained from whole cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous). Apart from stabilization, the challenges now included optimizing the biocatalyst for the non-natural substrates.The third, and present, wave of biocatalysis started with the work of Pim Stemmer and Frances Arnold in the mid and late 1990s.

        "other": "Over the past ten years, scientific and technological advances have established biocatalysis as a practical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional metallo-and organocatalysis in chemical synthesis, both in the laboratory and on an industrial scale. Key advances in DNA sequencing and gene synthesis are at the base of tremendous progress in tailoring biocatalysts by protein engineering and design, and the ability to reorganize enzymes into new biosynthetic pathways. To highlight these achievements, here we discuss applications of protein-engineered biocatalysts ranging from commodity chemicals to advanced pharmaceutical intermediates that use enzyme catalysis as a key step.\n\nEngineering enzymes to fit the manufacturing processTo minimize costs, chemical manufacture requires stable, selective and productive catalysts that operate under the desired process conditions. Engineering enzymes for such a process starts by defining the engineering goal, such as increased stability, selectivity, substrate range or, typically, a combination thereof. In 2000, before the third wave, only a few strategies were available to meet these goals. Enzyme immobilization could increase the stability of a protein, but the increases in stability were moderate and often insufficient for most chemical transformations. Directed evolution was also possible, but was still slow because it required construction and screening of large libraries that mostly contained variants with reduced, or even no, activity. Examples of drastic improvements were rarely of industrial relevance. The slow pace meant that the evolved proteins contained only a few changes and, thus, that the enzyme properties changed only slightly. Although several hundred enzymatic processes already had industrial uses 4 , most involved enzymes and whole cells that had been marginally altered genetically 29 .In the past decade, our understanding of proteins and the number of available directed evolution strategies have both increased, making it possible to make large changes in enzyme properties. By and large, enzyme engineering continues to be a collection of case studies resulting from applying one of various possible approaches to the problem at hand, rather than there being a quantitative approach such as those used in disciplines such as civil, electric, software, or chemical engineering.

        "intro": "r e v i e wBiocatalysis involves the use of enzymes, either in semipurified or immobilized form, or as whole-cell systems, for the preparation of molecules that are traditionally made using chemical synthesis. The field continues to expand its horizons, particularly as applied to the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1][2][3][4] . A useful biocatalyst (in particular, one that is suitable for application in an industrial context) is characterized by a number of features, including high catalytic turnover (>500 min -1 ), high selectivity for the particular transformation (for example, enantio-, regio-and chemoselectivity) and high process stability under the conditions that are required for the chemical transformation 5 . Biocatalysis often complements (rather than directly competes with) chemocatalysis in that it is probably best used for preparing relatively small (molecular weight < 500), enantiomerically pure chiral building blocks that are then combined with other chemically derived molecules to produce the final product. Biocatalysts have historically been widely applied in the brewing and food industries but are now finding increased application in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and even bulk chemicals. A recent and important trend is the development of new biocatalyst-based processes for the production of biofuels using renewable starting materials as an alternative to fossil fuels. In this sense biocatalysis should be viewed as an essential ingredient of the industrial biotechnology revolution that is happening all around us and that will alter the landscape of where the products and processes of the future are derived from. This review covers recent developments in the field of directed evolution of enzymes, highlighting advances in screening and library design and also giving examples of where enzyme evolution has had a major impact on the development of new biocatalysts.Irrespective of the target application that is envisaged, there are a number of key challenges that must be addressed in the development of a robust biocatalyst for practical applications (Fig. 1).

        "conclusion": "Summary and future perspectivesDirected evolution of enzymes has, in a relatively short period of time, made a rapid transition from being a new tool for studying the relationship between sequence and function to being an extremely useful and efficient method for optimizing biocatalysts for practical applications. Directed evolution is also being extended beyond single-enzyme systems to embrace metabolic pathways 90 , including carotenoid 91 biosynthesis and enzymes involved in the production of complex natural products via assembly lines 92 . Inevitably, the fields of rational, semirational and random redesign of enzymes are moving ever closer together, such that most directed evolution programs make use, where possible, of structural data in order to inform the library generation processes 93,94 .The key to a directed evolution program is the development of a reliable high-throughput screen, coupled with effective methods for generating libraries that are rich in variants containing new function, and in this respect researchers will continue to develop new protocols for library generation and high-throughput screening. Some reaction types are notoriously difficult to screen for in a general sense-for example, the oxidation of C-H bonds to give C-OH-and yet this transformation is one of the most important reactions in synthesis catalyzed by an enzyme. The further development of algorithms that can understand the relationship between sequence space and function will be extremely valuable. For the present, the de novo design of enzymes from scaffolds appears highly challenging but in the medium term may offer the prospect of generating truly new functions that will then serve as highly valuable starting points for further optimization when coupled with directed evolution. Exploitation of enzyme promiscuity will also emerge as a major theme contributing to the development of new biocatalyst function. Many roads lead to Rome, but all have in common the objective of understanding the factors involved in enzyme evolution and exploiting this knowledge to develop biocatalysts with exquisite properties for future applications.Published online at http://www.nature.com/naturechemicalbiology/.

        "other": "Directed evolution drives the next generation of biocatalysts\n\nNicholas J TurnerEnzymes are increasingly being used as biocatalysts in the generation of products that have until now been derived using traditional chemical processes. Such products range from pharmaceutical and agrochemical building blocks to fine and bulk chemicals and, more recently, components of biofuels. For a biocatalyst to be effective in an industrial process, it must be subjected to improvement and optimization, and in this respect the directed evolution of enzymes has emerged as a powerful enabling technology. Directed evolution involves repeated rounds of (i) random gene library generation, (ii) expression of genes in a suitable host and (iii) screening of libraries of variant enzymes for the property of interest. Both in vitro screening-based methods and in vivo selection-based methods have been applied to the evolution of enzyme function and properties. Significant developments have occurred recently, particularly with respect to library design, screening methodology, applications in synthetic transformations and strategies for the generation of new enzyme function.School of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre, Manchester, UK.

Published online 20 July 2009; doi:10.1038/nchembio.203 r e v i e wFor a protein that is composed of say 400 amino acids, there are approximately 20 400 different possible sequences that could exist. This level of diversity should be compared with the fact that the total number of atoms in the universe is estimated to be between 10 70 and 10 80 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/observable_universe)! Approaching the problem in a different way, if for example only one amino acid in a protein containing 400 amino acids is exchanged for any of the other 19 amino acids, there are already a total of 7,600 different variants. For two amino acids, the number rises to 144,000, for three the total is about 2.7 × 10 6 and for four replacements the total is 5.2 × 10 7 ! The challenge of accessing and screening such large sequence space brings with it an additional problem: the issue of how to navigate between different sequences. Proteins are generally regarded as having 'rugged' landscapes in terms of catalytic activity, which makes the correlation o"

Some reaction types are notoriously difficult to screen for in a general sense-for example, the oxidation of C-H bonds to give C-OH-and yet this transformation is one of the most important reactions in synthesis catalyzed by an enzyme. The further development of algorithms that can understand the relationship between sequence space and function will be extremely valuable. For the present, the de novo design of enzymes from scaffolds appears highly challenging but in the medium term may offer the prospect of generating truly new functions that will then serve as highly valuable starting points for further optimization when coupled with directed evolution.",

Here we demonstrate functional screening of a million-membered metagenomic library in microfluidic picolitre droplet compartments. Using bait substrates, new hydrolases for sulfate monoesters and phosphotriesters were identified, mostly based on promiscuous activities presumed not to be under selection pressure. Spanning three protein superfamilies, these break new ground in sequence space: promiscuity now connects enzymes with only distantly related sequences. Most hits could not have been predicted by sequence analysis, because the desired activities have never been ascribed to similar sequences, showing how this approach complements bioinformatic harvesting of metagenomic sequencing data. Functional screening of a library of unprecedented size with excellent assay sensitivity has been instrumental in identifying rare genes constituting catalytically versatile hubs in sequence space as potential starting points for the acquisition of new functions.",

A metagenomic library of 1,250,000 variants pooled from a variety of sources (combining libraries derived from soil, degraded plant material and cow rumen samples; 'SCV', Supplementary Table 1) was screened in droplets following the strategy illustrated in Fig. 1. Library members were expressed in Escherichia coli and single cells were compartmentalized (with a Poisson distribution that gives an average of B0.8 cells per droplet) into monodisperse 2 pl droplets (a volume found to allow suitably sensitive screening of metagenomic libraries-Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Bacteria were co-compartmentalized with lysis agents and the respective fluorogenic substrates (sulfate monoester 1d or phosphate triester 2d; Fig. 1) in two different screening experiments. After a two-day off-chip incubation, the emulsions were re-injected into the sorting chip, where B20 million droplets (covering the library size more than 15 times and found to be sufficient to recover all hits in a model library; Supplementary Figs 3 and 4) were analysed in B2 h and the brightest 0.01% (sulfatases) or 0.01 and 0.001% (phosphotriesterases (PTEs), in two sorts performed in parallel and later combined) of the droplets selected (Fig. 2b). This relatively tolerant detection threshold was chosen to avoid loss of potential hits. The selected droplets were subsequently deemulsified and plasmid DNA was recovered. The high-copy plasmid DNA allowed its direct re-transformation into E. coli 27 . The final number of transformants exceeded 10 4 (one droplet gave on average approximately five transforming clones depending on the plasmid copy number found to vary as a function of the insert size; Supplementary Fig. 6). To enrich the hits further, a second microfluidic screening cycle (Fig. 1) was performed with a lower cell/droplet ratio (0.1 cells per droplet), reducing the number of droplets containing multiple cells. Out of B10 million screened, B500 droplets were collected as arylsulfatase hits and B300 as PTEs (corresponding to B0.007% or B0.003% of droplets for sulfatases and PTEs, respectively; Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).

        "discussion": "DiscussionOne of the main limitations in functional metagenomics is the difficulty of discovering rare genes. Indeed, much work in this field has focused on widely occuring enzymes such as lipases, esterases and carbohydrate-converting enzymes 18 . To identify potentially less widespread activities, effective screening technologies are key 31 to covering larger metagenomic sequence space 21 and beating the odds. In this work, we establish droplet screening as a general method to find new, rare enzymes (6 and 8 hits out of 1,250,000 clones for sulfatase and PTE, respectively) in metagenomes using hydrolytic turnover of two different baits as initial target activities. Previous attempts at harvesting environmental samples by droplet screening have not successfully identified DNA sequences that correspond to the selected phenotype 30 . By contrast, this present work has yielded functional information on new metagenomic sequences from droplet experiments, for the first time. More generally, no metagenomic campaign had so far identified triesterases or sulfatases, possibly because they are much less abundant than the above-mentioned enzymes (and certainly with fewer known examples in the literature). Our screening capacity of 45 Â 10 6 assays per hour enables B10 8 assays per day so that libraries of on survival-based assays 51 or substrate-induced regulators (for example, in SIGEX) 52 . The high sensitivity of the miniaturized cell lysate assay allowed the isolation of enzymes with catalytic efficiencies (k cat /K M ) ranging from 54 M À 1 s À 1 (P84) to 9 Â 10 5 M À 1 s À 1 (P83; Table 1), providing evidence that this microfluidic platform is able to identify slow and fast catalysts, with a wide dynamic range extending over four orders of magnitude. Our protocol is straightforward as the readout is directly reporting on enzymatic activity, so that promiscuous activities are accessible. The versatility of microfluidic workflows 53 makes our platform adaptable for different challenges: to further increase our assay sensitivity (or diminish incubation time) bacterial growth in droplets could be implemented after cell encapsulation, by implementation of an additional microfluidic injection (or droplet fusion) step to supply lysis agents and substrates. Furthermore, the microfluidic platform is readily applicable to other enzymatic activities, as long as a fluorogen",

Environmental libraries from various soils 57 and vanilla pods were constructed 58 starting with shearing eDNA using a nebulizer and blunting it using Klenow fragment. Next, the resulting 3-5 kbp fragments were cloned into the EcoRV restriction site in the high-copy plasmid pZero-2 (Invitrogen). DNA from cow rumen was partially digested with the restriction enzyme MluCI. DNA fragments with sizes around 3 kbp were isolated by gel electrophoresis and cloned into the EcoRI site of the same high-copy plasmid pZero-2. The resulting ten libraries (Supplementary Table 1) were pooled together, constituting a library of about 1,250,000 variants, called the 'SCV library'.Chip design and microfluidic device fabrication. The designs for the poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) chip devices were prepared using Autocad CAD software and designs are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4. The corresponding CAD files can be downloaded from http://openwetware.org/wiki/DropBase (a database of microfluidic device designs). The devices were fabricated with standard soft lithographic procedures 59 . The photoresist material SU-8 2015 was used to obtain a 15 mm channel height. PDMS monomer and curing agent were mixed at a ratio 10:1 and then poured onto the lithographic plate before degassing. After PDMS solidification (65 °C, 4 h), PDMS was activated by exposure to an oxygen plasma and devices were sealed onto a microscope glass slide (or cover slip (thickness: 0.13 mm) for the sorting chip). Hydrophobic modification of the channels surface was achieved by injecting a solution of 1% (v/v) trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (Sigma) in HFE-7500 oil into the channels.

        "other": "A much broader range of enzyme catalysts than currently known is needed to address a number of challengesfrom the implementation of green, sustainable processes in white biotechnology 1 to a fundamental understanding of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic basis of biocatalysis. Microbial ecosystems are viewed as enormous reservoirs of genetic diversity 2 , but 99% of environmental microorganisms are understood to be unculturable as yet 3 . Extensive sequencing efforts using DNA that was directly extracted from environmental samples (eDNA) have already given unprecedented insight into the make-up and genetic diversity of such ecosystems 4 . However, extrapolation from sequence to protein function is not trivial and often gives only a rough idea of functional assignments 5 . As a consequence, annotations frequently prove to be incorrect when tested experimentally 6 . Large-scale experimental characterization would be the preferred basis of functional annotation of proteins, but is currently time-consuming and expensive: which is why sequencing dominates metagenomic explorations. Furthermore, it is especially difficult to predict entirely new enzymes without precedent: genes without significant homology, encoding catalysts for unfamiliar reactions that have not yet been comprehensively assigned are likely to be overlooked (or remain unannotated). As a consequence, the percentage of genes with unknown functions in newly sequenced genomes has remained constant over the last decade (at B30-40%) 7 .Functional annotation is further complicated by increasing evidence for catalytic promiscuity (that is, the ability of enzymes to process more than one type of substrate). Promiscuous side activities assist evolutionary adaptation by providing a head start activity after gene duplication, enabling a smoother route from one enzyme function to another by avoiding loss of function during their interconversion 8,9 . Enzyme promiscuity is even harder (and often impossible) to predict by sequence analysis than primary activities 10 , thus adding multiple dimensions to the challenge of experimental identification of function. As a consequence, the functional potential of this 'underground network' 11 remains largely unexplored. Functional characterizations of protein families suggest however that promiscuity is an intrinsic enzyme property 12,13 , a potential marker for evo"

      "abstract": "Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A (GLA) leading to the lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other glycosphingolipids. Fabry patients experience significant damage to the heart, kidney, and blood vessels that can be fatal. Here we apply directed evolution to generate more stable GLA variants as potential next generation treatments for Fabry disease. GLAv05 and GLAv09 were identified after screening more than 12,000 GLA variants through 8 rounds of directed evolution. Both GLAv05 and GLAv09 exhibit increased stability at both lysosomal and blood pH, stability to serum, and elevated enzyme activity in treated Fabry fibroblasts (19-fold) and GLA -/-podocytes (10-fold). GLAv05 and GLAv09 show improved pharmacokinetics in mouse and non-human primates. In a Fabry mouse model, the optimized variants showed prolonged half-lives in serum and relevant tissues, and a decrease of accumulated Gb3 in heart and kidney. To explore the possibility of diminishing the immunogenic potential of rhGLA, amino acid residues in sequences predicted to bind MHC II were targeted in late rounds of GLAv09 directed evolution. An MHC II-associated peptide proteomics assay confirmed a reduction in displayed peptides for GLAv09. Collectively, our findings highlight the promise of using directed evolution to generate enzyme variants for more effective treatment of lysosomal storage diseases.Fabry disease is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism, characterized by progressive systemic accumulation of glycosphingolipids including globotriaosylceramide (Gb3, GL-3, ceramide trihexoside). The disease is caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase A (GLA) gene that cause a deficiency of the active enzyme in the lysosome 1 . This genetic defect can lead to progressive cardiac disease, renal failure, small fiber peripheral neuropathy, cerebrovascular disease, as well as symptoms that affect other systems 2,3 . The estimated incidence of Fabry disease is 1 in 50,000 live births, though recent newborn screening studies suggest a much higher occurrence in certain populations 4 .The most widely used treatment for Fabry disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GLA (rhGLA). Two preparations, agalsidase alfa (Replagal ® , Takeda) and agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme ® , Sanofi), have been shown to slow disease progression when administered regularly and have been approved for the treatment of Fabry disease. Other GLA ERTs that have been recently approved or are in late-stage development include pegunigalsidase alfa 5 , a plant cell culture-expressed, chemically-modified version of GLA, and moss-cell produced GLA 6 . A small molecule therapy, migalastat (Galafold ® , Amicus Therapeutics) is an oral chaperone therapy that increases residual enzymatic activity in a subset of patients who have an amenable GLA mutation (30-50% of patients). Other therapies such as glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors (Lucerastat) 7 , and gene 8 and cell therapies 9 are currently in clinical development, while additional therapeutic options are also being investigated 10 .During ERT, rhGLA is rapidly cleared from serum, requiring patients to receive biweekly infusions that entail significant impacts to the patient's quality of life and the health care system 11,12 . Even with frequent administration of GLA, patients often continue to exhibit severe disease phenotypes and suffer early mortality [13][14][15] . The failure of ERT to entirely correct the cause of disease is possibly due to incomplete restoration of enzyme activity in the lysosomes of cells in the key affected tissues of the heart and kidney. This may be due to the instability of rhGLA",

        "results": "ResultsDirected evolution of GLA. We performed iterative rounds of GLA library generation, high throughput screening, and next generation sequencing (NGS), combined with in silico analyses to identify GLA variants with increased stability in vitro that we hypothesized would lead to improved pharmacological properties. An overview of our approach is shown in Fig. 1.We designed initial libraries to target key surface residues based on available structural information 23 while avoiding active site residues to minimize the risk of inadvertently altering substrate specificity. Initially, we generated GLA mutant libraries via both site saturation mutagenesis and multi-site mutagenesis; multi-site libraries were based on amino acid sequences of GLA homologs. The libraries were expressed and secreted from S. cerevisiae.Given that lysosomal ERTs are exposed to neutral pH (pH 7.4) during manufacturing and within the bloodstream after infusion, and then to the acidic pH of the lysosome (pH 4.4) upon uptake in target cells, our first objective was to improve stability across a broad pH range. GLA variants from the various libraries were secreted from S. cerevisiae and after incubation at pH 7.4 or pH 4.2, residual GLA enzyme activity was determined using a standard fluorescence assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl α-d-galactopyranoside(4-MU-Gal) 24 . In the first screening round, among the hundreds of variants tested we identified a lysine-to-alanine mutation at position 237 (K237A) that improved stability relative to rhGLA, by 1.5-fold at pH 7 and 2.5-fold at pH 4.2. An example of screening data showing a library tested for pH 7 stability is presented in Fig. 1B.The next iteration of enzyme optimization was based on the K237A mutant as the parental sequence, and incorporated combinations of other beneficial mutations that had been identified during the first round of evolution. We screened as described above and identified variants with further improvements in stability, the best of which was selected as the parent for the next set of libraries. This cycle was repeated for a total of 8 rounds (7 rounds involving expression in S. cerevisiae and a final round incorporating variant expression in HEK293T cells), incorporating mutations from both site-saturation mutagenesis and homologous sequences.In later rounds of library generation and screening, we adapted screens for addit",
        "intro": "Mouse and non-human primate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).As the most rigorous test of GLA performance in the physiological context of a live animal, we determined the plasma PK properties of GLA, GLAv05 and GLAv09 in mice and cynomolgus monkeys (non-human primates, NHPs). We dosed animals at 1 mg/kg i.v. and followed enzyme activity in the plasma over time. This measure allowed us to follow the fate of active GLA enzyme but may underestimate the total amount (catalytically active and inactive) of circulating GLA protein.As previously reported 31 , GLA activity in plasma decreased rapidly after administration and was undetectable after 1 h in mouse and after 2 h in NHP. In contrast, GLAv05 and GLAv09 exhibited much greater perdurance with measurable activity remaining 6 h after administration in mouse (Fig. 4A) and after 8 h in NHP (Fig. 4B). The half-lives in mouse of GLAv05 and GLAv09 were > 10-fold longer than for GLA. In NHP, GLAv05 and GLAv09 both showed terminal half-lives > 7-fold longer than GLA (Fig. 4A,B; Table 2).To determine whether GLAv05 and GLAv09 exhibit improved biodistribution in key tissues, we dosed Fabry mice at 1 mg/kg i.v. and sacrificed the animals at time points ranging from 5 min through 24 h to collect heart, kidney, spleen, and liver. As shown in Fig. 4C-F and Table 3, the GLA variants demonstrated improved tissue PK parameters as compared to GLA. The total amount of alpha galactosidase activity in the kidney for GLAv05 and GLAv09, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC), was 8-9-fold greater than for GLA, while heart activity for GLAv09 was 2-fold greater than for GLA. These results suggest that increased plasma half-life for a GLA enzyme translates to increased enzyme accumulation in the kidney and heart.Finally, we sought to determine whether increased enzymatic activity in the kidney and heart of GLAv05 and GLAv09 leads to a reduction of Gb3 in these key affected organs compared to the standard of care ERT agalsidasebeta (Fabrazyme ® ). We intravenously dosed 5-month-old female mice with GLA variants at 1 mg/kg, then sacrificed the animals at 1, 2, or 4 weeks and harvested the heart, kidney, and liver for analysis of Gb3 content. GLAv05 and GLAv09 showed increased activity in the heart relative to GLA (agalsidase-beta, Fabrazyme ® ) (Fig. 5A) (and at levels similar to endogenous GLA in a healthy mouse 3",
        "discussion": "DiscussionWe employed directed evolution to address the therapeutic shortcomings of GLA for the treatment of Fabry disease by engineering two variants, GLAv05 and GLAv09, for improved stability in serum and lysosomes and increased intracellular activity in target tissues. These variants also have a similar or lower predicted propensity to induce immune responses as compared to the wild-type enzyme 4,[38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46] . Variants GLAv05 and GLAv09 demonstrate improved in vivo circulating half-life, tissue activity, and Gb3 clearance in the Fabry mouse model due to the translatability of in vitro directed evolution.Various other approaches toward overcoming GLA limitations have been explored. Pegunigalsidase alfa, a PEGylated, cross-linked recombinant human GLA enzyme produced in plant cells 47 is being evaluated in Phase 3 clinical trials. The chemical modifications of pegunigalsidase alfa confer stability in human plasma (30% activity after 1 h compared to complete inactivation of GLA) and a 9.7 h terminal half-life in GLA -/-mice following a 1 mg/kg infusion 48 . The plasma stability of GLAv05 and GLAv09 compare favorably to pegunigalsidase alfa, as both retain > 80% activity after 24 h, though PEGylation appears to improve the serum half-life of pegunigalsidase alfa relative to our engineered variants. Future studies directly comparing these enzymes would be helpful toward understanding how these parameters may impact tissue distribution and efficacy.Other approaches for improving the intrinsic limitations of GLA include rational mutagenesis of cysteine residues 49 , active site, dimer interface, and glycosylation sites 50 , deletion of C-terminal sequences 51 , rational modification of alternative enzymes 32 , the use of alternative expression hosts, such as moss 52 and tobacco cells 48 , glycoengineering to improve affinity to the M6P receptor or increase M6P moieties on the enzyme 32,[53][54][55] , and fusion proteins for improved tissue targeting 56,57 . While each of these approaches addresses aspects of intrinsic GLA shortcomings, our approach allows for the comprehensive optimization of multiple properties simultaneously via high-throughput screening of variant libraries under conditions that mimic the path the therapy is exposed to and the natural inactivation strategies it may encounter in the human body upon administration as ER",
        "methods": "Materials and methodsConstruction of expression vectors. The human GLA gene was codon optimized for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A chimeric GLA expression construct encoding a 19-amino acid S. cerevisiae MF-alpha signal sequence fused to the mature form of the codon-optimized GLA was generated in the yeast expression vector pYT-72Bgl 63 and was utilized in rounds 1 through 7. A chimeric GLA expression construct encoding a synthetic mouse Ig signal sequence fused to a synthetic gene coding for the mature human GLA coding sequence (either S. cerevisiae or human codon optimized) was generated in pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen) for expression of recombinant GLA variants in HEK293T cells. For round 8 of directed evolution, transcriptionally active PCR products for the GLA variants encompassing promoter, GLA gene, and terminator were used for high-throughput transient transfections.Library design and generation. Libraries of variants with single amino acid mutations as well as combinatorial libraries recombining multiple mutations, were generated by standard mutagenesis methods 64 using PCR and degenerate oligos (i.e. NNK, NNN, NNS) to incorporate mutations at the targeted position.HTP expression of GLA variants in yeast. Yeast (INVSc1) cells (Catalog #C81000, ThermoFisher Scientific), transformed with vectors expressing GLA variants using the lithium acetate procedure 65 , were plated on SD-Ura medium (2 g/L SD Media-Ura, 6.8 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids [Sigma Aldrich]), 3.06 g/L sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.804 g/L disodium hydrogen phosphate (pH 6.0) 6% glucose. After 72 h incubation at 30 °C, colonies were picked into the wells of Axygen ® 1.1 mL 96-well deep well plates containing 200 µL/well SD-Ura. The cells were grown for 20-24 h in a Kuhner shaker (250 rpm, 30 °C, and 85% relative humidity). Overnight culture samples (20 µL) were transferred into Coming Costar ® 96-well deep plates filled with 380 µL of SD-Ura broth supplemented with 2% glucose. The plates were incubated for 66-84 h in a Kuhner shaker (250 rpm, 30 °C, and 85% relative humidity).

A second cause of poor delivery of GLA to the target tissues is the development of an immune reaction to the GLA protein. In male patients, infusion reactions and neutralizing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) are present in up to 73% of patients treated with agalsidase beta and 24% of patients treated with agalsidase alfa 16 . Patients who develop neutralizing ADAs experience attenuation of ERT efficacy over time [16][17][18][19] . Suboptimal exposure due to instability, infusion-associated side reactions, and the long-term inhibiting effects of neutralizing antibodies represent major shortcomings for GLA ERT to provide adequate, life-long, efficacious treatment of Fabry disease 20,21 .The goal of this study was to identify variants of GLA that show improved performance as potential nextgeneration therapies for Fabry patients. For this purpose we applied directed evolution 22 to GLA through cycles of semi-rational design of protein libraries, high throughput in vitro activity assays, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics, to discover engineered GLA variants with improved properties.\n\nAssessment of neo-antigens in GLA variants.A possible unwanted consequence of the directed evolution strategy is that mutations may form neo-epitopes that generate an immune reaction in Fabry patients that express a full length GLA with low alpha galactosidase activity (cross-reactive immunogenic material positive or CRIM+). We used a T-cell proliferation assay that provides an assessment of the CD4+ T-cell response elicited by exposure to GLA, GLAv05, or GLAv09 36,37 .Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 30 healthy donors were treated with GLA, GLAv05, GLAv09, or controls, and T-cell proliferation was measured by [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation on days 5, 6, 7, and 8. GLA induced T-cell proliferation in 3/30 donors in GLA and GLAv09, where in GLAv05 induced T-cell proliferation in only 1/30 donors (Fig. 7). These response rates were significantly lower than those observed for the clinical benchmark control Bydureon (12/30) and the highly immunogenic neoantigen Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) positive control (27/30). Thus, the 11 mutations in GLAv05 and the 17 mutations in GLAv09 do not cause an increase in T-cell proliferation relative to the w"

        "results": "ResultsThe structure of AtNIT4. To study the molecular details of helical twist on substrate specificity we reconstructed an active plant NIT by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy. Preliminary screening of plant NITs revealed a general pattern of heterogeneity with limited helical order. In general, NIT4 produced better filaments than NIT1, but these were still somewhat curved, short and broken (Fig. 1a). We screened buffer conditions and protein concentration in an attempt to improve filament quality without success. Eventually, we unexpectedly discovered that by incubating and blotting freshly prepared Arabidopsis thaliana nitrilase 4 (AtNIT4) (NP_197622.1) before vitrification in a 10% humidity, 25 °C environment, we could improve the quality of the imaged fibers (Fig. 1b). Despite this, we only observed reflections to a resolution of ~9 Å after vertical alignment (Fig. 1c). Clear secondary structure was visible in classified averages, but with a rapid loss of resolution with increasing distance from the center of the images, indicating poor longrange helical order (Fig. 1d). Treating one helical turn (five dimers) as a single particle and selecting a homogeneous dataset through rounds of 2D and 3D classification allowed us to achieve a resolution of 3.4 Å (gold-standard Fourier shell coefficient (FSC) = 0.143) (EMD-0320, pdb id: 6i00) (Fig. 1e and Table 1).Helical structure of NIT4. AtNIT4 is a left-handed helical tube with 4.9 sunbunits (dimers) in one helical turn, a pitch of 8.62 nm, an outer diameter of ~13 nm, and a ~2 nm hollow core (Fig. 2a, b). There are two diad axes, which are related to one another by a -5°(negative value: left-handed by convention) rotation and 4.31 nm translation along the helical axis. The first passes through the C-and D-interfaces 2 and the second passes between the A-and F-interfaces 2,4 (Fig. 2c). A ~1 nm gap (Fig. 2b) across the helical groove shows that contrary to what has been observed previously in negative stain 8 , this region lacks stabilizing interactions (D-or F-interfaces). Amino acid residues involved in the formation of helical interfaces are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Interestingly, the predominant interaction stabilizing the filament is between the C-terminal tails of four adjacent monomers, which all contribute strands that form a row of ß-sheets in the core of the enzyme (Fig. 2d, f).The subst",
        "discussion": "DiscussionNITs are attractive biocatalysts for the synthesis of amides and carboxylic acids for use in the manufacture of drugs and fine chemicals 30 . Novel specificities are generally discovered by environmental sampling 31 or sequence data mining 32,33 . In some cases, activity against a particular substrate or substrate class has been increased by up to ~3-8-fold by rational design 15 or directed evolution 34 . We recently saw a ~500-fold improvement in activity for a substrate after a single amino acid exchange and discovered that this correlated with a change in the helical twist of the NIT filament 8 . At the time, the molecular basis for this change was unclear, because we did not have an atomic resolution structure of an active helical NIT. We speculated that the change in substrate size preference resulted from compression of the active-site pocket at the helical interface. This is noteworthy because one of the distinguishing features of branch 1 NITs (EC 3.5.5.1) is that they form helical-, turn-, or spiral-quaternary structures, the basic architecture of these assemblies is conserved in phylogenetically diverse NITs [2][3][4][5][6][7][8]35,36 and appear necessary for activity 21,37 . Crystal structures of members of the NIT superfamily have been available for almost 20 years 38,39 and today there >20 crystal structures of various members deposited in the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/). Extensive attempts to crystallize a helical NIT by ourselves and others failed and Thuku et al. 21 attributed this to the irregular/ ~5-fold symmetry of the NIT helix, which presumably interferes with crystallization. This limits our structural understanding of the active NIT oligomer to ~20 Å electron microscopy information because of the heterogeneous nature of the filaments, until the publication in 2014 by Zhang et al. 15 of the first helical NIT crystal structure. Interestingly, they observed that 55 C-terminal amino acids were cleaved off before crystallization. This fortuitously led to the formation of filaments with a helical twist of -61°with sufficient flexibility to allow crystallization, but unfortunately also altered the oligomeric structure of the protein and abolished activity (our unpublished results).Here, we describe the first active NIT filament structure interpretable to atomic resolution. The structure shares conserved features with ",

His-tagged NITs in pET-21b(+) (Novagen) were expressed at 37 °C in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Agilent Technologies) for 4 h in LB containing 100 μg ml -1 ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG. The cells were pelleted at 4 °C and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl with cOmplete TM protease inhibitor (Roche) and sonicated on ice for 4 min (at 15 s intervals) (Sonicator ® 3000, Misonix). The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a Ni 2+ -NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column and washed with 50 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and eluted over a gradient up to 500 mM imidazole. The NIT-containing peak was pooled and loaded onto a TSKgel PWXL4000 HPLC size exclusion column (Tosoh Corp), equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and the leading edge of the NIT-containing peak was collected. Cryo-EM grids were immediately prepared using this material and aliquots destined for long-term storage were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C after addition of 1 mM DTT. Activity assays were performed after buffer exchange into 50 mM potassium phosphate pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT.Negative-stain electron microscopy and image processing. NIT filaments were negatively stained according to standard practices (e.g., Booth et al. 46 ). Briefly, 3μl of NIT solution was incubated for 30 s on glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids before being washed three times with distilled water and stained with two exchanges of 2% uranyl acetate. The grids were loaded into a FEI/Tecnai F20 FEGTEM equipped with a 4k × 4k CCD camera (GATAN US4000 Ultrascan, CA, USA) and imaged at a sampling of 2.11 Å pixel -1 at 200 kV with a defocus of -1.0 µm under standard low-dose conditions.

Plant NITs for which substrate specificity data is available were used: A. thaliana NIT1, NIT3 12 , and NIT4 10 Gray indicates that the substrate reacts to form a high-absorbance product, but after incubating with the mutant, the absorbance was reduced. White indicates a slightly higher AtNIT4 wt activity compared to the mutant. f Enzyme activity results, asterisk indicates no measurable ammonia formation after incubating for 30 min with 5× excess enzyme. AtNIT4 wt showed no nitrilase activity against any of the listed substrates except for βcyano-L-alanine. The mutant showed high activity against potassium cyanide, 2-cyanopyridine and 2-furonitrile and moderate activity against fluoroacetonitrile and 4-cyanopyridine (1st quartile, median and 2nd quartile ± sd) n = 3 independent activity measurements CrNIT2: XM_006284056.1). Sequences were allocated to NIT4, NIT1, and specialist NIT1 groups and compared in pairs: amino acid positions were allocated one point when a residue differed between the groups and the substrate differed, or when the residue remained the same when the substrate remained the same. Points were subtracted when this was not the case.Library construction. The A. thaliana nitrilase 4 (AT5G22300) pET-21b(+) vector was a gift from Markus Piotrowski (Ruhr-Universität Bochum). Sequential randomization of the chosen sites was achieved with NNS (N = A/T/C/G; S = G/C) degenerate codons applying a modified QuikChange ® PCR protocol 59 using HiFi Hotstart Readymix (Kappa Biosystems). PCR reactions (50 μl) with 1-2 ng of template DNA were run under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min (1 cycle); 98 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 4 min (20-30 cycles); and 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle) and subsequently digested with DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Sufficient DNA for large-scale transformation was obtained by pooling several rounds of PCR product and gel purifying (Zyppy™ Gel Purification Kit, Zymo Research).

        "other": "B ranch 1 nitrilases (EC 3.5.5.1) (NITs) are industrially important 1 oligomeric enzymes (forming left-handed twists, spirals, turns or helices) that share a common architecture [2][3][4][5][6][7][8] and catalyze the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids and ammonia and/or amides 9 . In all plants, the nitrilase 4 (EC 4.2.1.65) (NIT4) group represents the ancestral form, which is highly specific for β-cyano-L-alanine 10 . The derived NIT1 group, which is restricted to the Brassicaceae family includes NIT1, NIT2, and NIT3, is believed to have arisen from multiple gene duplication events 11 . NIT1s generally display measurable activity against a large range of aliphatic and aromatic nitriles, but cannot catalyze the hydrolysis of β-cyano-L-alanine 12 , while NIT4 shows either extremely minor (<0.75%) or no activity for the best substrates of the NIT1 group 10 . It is thought that the NIT1 group enzymes evolved to catabolise the diverse glucosinolate-derived nitriles found in the Brassicaceae [11][12][13] . Interestingly, plant NITs with high specificity against a single substrate or narrow group of substrates have evolved from the ancestral generalist NIT1 group enzymes 8,13,14 .We recently discovered that substrate specificity in plant NITs is related to the structure of the NIT helical assembly 8 . The helical twist (Δϕ) of the NIT filament is correlated with the size of the preferred substrate: NIT4 enzymes have a relatively large helical twist, small substrate size, and high specificity, while NIT1 enzymes have a smaller twist and broader specificity. Specialized NIT1 enzymes that have evolved higher specificity and small substrate size show a larger helical twist 8 . Helical twist is not the only determinant of specificity: we have identified plant NITs with similar twists, but different substrate specificities. In this case, exchanging amino acid residues lining the proposed active site pocket led to a change in substrate preference, indicating that these regions play a role in substrate recognition 8 . The molecular details of this mechanism still remain speculative because only a low-twist helical NIT has been visualized crystallographically: the NIT from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (BAA10717.1) (Nit6803) Δ291 (pdb id: 3wuy 15 ) (Δφ = -60°).Here we present what we believe to be the first close-to-atomic structure of a full-length active helical NIT "

Its success has been largely due to a rapid expansion of the range of chemical reactions accessible, made possible by advanced tools for enzyme discovery coupled with high-throughput laboratory evolution techniques for biocatalyst optimization. A wide range of tailor-made enzymes with high efficiencies and selectivities can now be produced quickly and on a gram to kilogram scale, with dedicated databases and search tools aimed at making these biocatalysts accessible to a broader scientific community. This Primer discusses the current state-of-the-art methodology in the field, including route design, enzyme discovery, protein engineering and the implementation of biocatalysis in industry. We highlight recent advances, such as de novo design and directed evolution, and discuss parameters that make a good reproducible biocatalytic process for industry. The general concepts will be illustrated by recent examples of applications in academia and industry, including the development of multistep enzyme cascades.",

Each individual library member is represented by a recombinant single cell, compartmentalised in an emulsion droplet, in which an activity assay is carried out. Key to the success of this approach is the precision and sensitivity of the assay. Assay quality is most profoundly challenged when initially weak, promiscuous activities are to be enhanced in early rounds of directed evolution or when entirely novel catalysts are to be identified from metagenomic sources. Implementation of measures to widen the dynamic range of clonal assays would increase the chances of finding and generating new biocatalysts. Here, we demonstrate that the assay sensitivity and DNA recovery can be improved by orders of magnitude by growth of initially singly compartmentalised cells in microdroplets. Homogeneous cell growth is achieved by continuous oxygenation and recombinant protein expression is regulated by diffusion of an inducer from the oil phase. Reaction conditions are adjusted by directed droplet coalescence to enable full control of buffer composition and kinetic incubation time, creating level playing field conditions for library selections. The clonal amplification multiplies the product readout because more enzyme is produced per compartment. At the same time, phenotypic variation is reduced by measuring monoclonal populations rather than single cells and recovery efficiency is increased. Consequently, this workflow increases the efficiency of lysate-based microfluidic enzyme assays and will make it easier for protein engineers to identify or evolve new enzymes for applications in synthetic and chemical biology.",

        "intro": "IntroductionEnzymes are increasingly used for sustainable chemical synthesis, as they are powerful 'green' catalysts providing efficient turnover and remarkable stereo-and enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions. 1,2 If a reaction that does not exist in nature is to be catalysed, there are two principal routes to enzymes with novel activities: either natural enzymes with secondary, promiscuous activities [3][4][5] are fine-tuned to the requisites of industrial processes, often via directed evolution; alternatively, new enzyme functions can either be discovered by functional metagenomics in large samples of natural biodiversity [6][7][8][9][10] or introduced by computational design. [11][12][13] In all cases, the initially weak activity of an enzyme is likely to require improvements and directed evolution is usually the method of choice. This artificial Darwinian process consists of repeated cycles of mutagenesis and selection and has led to many successful biocatalysts. [14][15][16] The prospects of directed evolution campaigns, however, improve with the practical ability to explore greater diversity via ever higher throughput screening approaches. In the last decade, compartmentalisation of single library members and miniaturisation of reaction volumes in droplet microfluidics (see Fig. 1) has proven a valuable and efficient tool for enzyme evolution. 17,18 Single library members (e.g. cells expressing 19 or displaying 20 enzyme variants) are co-encapsulated with the substrate and reaction progress is followed in chromogenic or fluorogenic reactions by optical interrogation of dropletcompartmentalised library members. Droplets can be sorted with kHz frequencies, enabling fast screening of tens of millions of variants in a day, in picoliter volumes. [19][20][21] In addition to maximal throughput, the dynamic range and sensitivity of the assay (including the analytical technologies for measuring product concentrations) are key features relevant for success. Indeed, concentrations of fluorescent reaction product as low 2.5 nM could be detected in a metagenomic screening of hydrolases, corresponding to just ∼2500 molecules of the reaction product fluorescein in 2 pL droplets. 6 Consequently, even hits with relatively low activities (k cat /K M ∼50 M -1 s -1 ) could be identified. This means the sensitivity of droplet screening is increased by several ",

        "conclusion": "ConclusionThe new workflow achieves an increase in the detection limit, sensitivity and recovery efficiency of microdroplet-based screening of enzyme libraries and delivers the following:(i) A device for droplet incubation in a densely filled chamber. Emulsions are incubated in modified commercial 0.5 mL reaction tubes requiring no additional equipment, in a much simpler set-up and higher throughput compared to the more complicated devices used previously for cell biological analysis 45 or for metagenomic screening. 33 Incubation in the modified chamber results in tightly packed emulsions by passively draining the excess oil phase left from droplet generation, providing the large numbers and stability necessary for prolonged screening campaigns. Droplets can easily be withdrawn for analysis or manipulation and returned for incubation under oxygenating conditions. Oxygenation by oil perfusion resulted high growth rates and crucially homogeneous populations.(ii) Passive delivery of assay component via the oil phase. Supplying each droplet continuously via the oil flow with oxygen leads to faster cell growth and growth homogeneity in all droplets. Supplementing the oil additionally with the inducer aTc switches on protein expression, allowing separate timescales for cell growth and expression (e.g. for proteins that are toxic or assays with high cellular background). By clonal amplification more enzyme molecules are produced per droplet, leading to a higher product signal and easier detection.(iii) Active delivery of assay components via droplet manipulation. Controlled addition of substrate and lysis reagents by pico-fusion of droplets permits precise timing of the reaction start, so that the optimal ratio of signal generated by the enzymatic reaction to noise of the uncatalysed background reactions can be chosen. This increases the dynamic range for reactions with high chemical backgrounds. Furthermore, the buffer composition for reaction is adjusted from the cell growth medium in this step, widening the scope of detectable reactions and allowing cell lysis to release intracellularly expressed enzymes.(iv) Clonal amplification multiplies the product readout. Cell growth leads to more expressed enzyme, which, after catalytic turnover, leads to more product generated per droplet compartment. Here, we demonstrated in an absorbance assay in droplets 22 that the d",
        "other": "Achieving homogeneous cell growth in dropletsFirst, a suitable device for droplet incubation needed to be prepared that allows for robust storage and convenient handling of emulsions, such as direct re-injection into a sorting device. For this purpose, modified 0.5 mL reaction tubes were used (Fig. 2A and S1 †). These droplet incubation chambers can easily be prepared by opening access holes into a standard plastic reaction tube with a biopsy punch and attaching access tubing with high-viscosity plastic glue. The droplets are directly collected from the generation device into such a chamber prefilled with oil. During incubation the droplets packed at the Lab Chip, 2021, 21, 163-173 | 165 This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021top of the oil in the chamber, allowing for a convenient and robust way to incubate large emulsion volumes without destabilization by surface effects and for easy re-injection into subsequent microfluidic devices, as necessary for extensive microfluidic screening campaigns.Next, cell growth was established in these incubation chambers. To test the hypothesis that oxygen availability is key to homogeneous growth, static and oxygenated cell growth in droplets was compared. A live cell stain compatible with absorbance-activated droplet sorting (AADS) was found in WST-1 that was injected into the droplets after growth. WST-1 absorbance changes concomitantly with reduction of NAD + in a coupled reaction. 22 Amplification of cells in droplets was first tested in the most straightforward format, by encapsulating single cells into droplets filled with growth medium and incubation at 37 °C for 16 h without any oxygenation or mixing. Occupied droplets (empty droplets are ignored) incubated under these static growth conditions showed a main peak at low absorbance values with a very evident tail (Fig. 2B), indicating that most droplets show little growth amplification whereas few droplets (showing up in the tail) provide conditions for higher cell growth, so that a mixed population is the result. We sought to establish homogeneity in the droplet population by pushing oil through the incubation chamber, thus providing gentle mixing and oxygen supply. When relatively low oil flow rates for oxygenation (4 μl min -1 per 100 μl of emulsion) were used, homogeneous cell growth could be achieved. To quantify the effect of oxygenation on the g"

We propose that the expense of experimentally testing a large number of protein variants can be decreased and the outcome can be improved by incorporating machine learning with directed evolution. Simulations on an empirical fitness landscape demonstrate that the expected performance improvement is greater with this approach. Machine learning-assisted directed evolution from a single parent produced enzyme variants that selectively synthesize the enantiomeric products of a new-to-nature chemical transformation. By exploring multiple mutations simultaneously, machine learning efficiently navigates large regions of sequence space to identify improved proteins and also produces diverse solutions to engineering problems. human GB1 binding protein (theoretical library size, 20 4 = 160,000 variants). We then use machine learning-assisted directed evolution to engineer an enzyme for stereodivergent carbon-silicon bond formation, a new-to-nature chemical transformation.",
        "results": "ResultsDirected Evolution and Machine Learning. In directed evolution, a library of variants is constructed from parental sequences and screened for desired properties, and the best variants are used to parent the next round of evolution; all other variants are discarded. When machine learning assists directed evolution, sequences and screening data from all of the variants can be used to train a panel of models (covering linear, kernel, neural network, and ensemble methods; SI Appendix, Model Training). The models with the highest accuracy are then used to screen variants in a round of in silico evolution, whereby the models simulate the fitnesses of all possible sequences and rank the sequences by fitness. A restricted library containing the variants with the highest predicted fitnesses is then constructed and screened experimentally.This work explores the full combinatorial space of mutations at multiple positions. Fig. 1 illustrates the approach considering a set of four mutated positions. In a conventional directed evolution experiment with sequential single mutations, the identification of optimal amino acids for N positions in a set requires N rounds of evolution (Fig. 1A). An alternative directed evolution approach is to randomly sample the combinatorial space and recombine the best mutations found at each position in a subsequent combinatorial library (Fig. 1B). Machine learningassisted evolution samples the same combinatorial space with comutated positions in silico, enabling larger steps through se-quence space in each round (Fig. 1C). In this approach, data from a random sample of the combinatorial library, the input library, are used to train machine learning models. These models are used to predict a smaller set of variants, the predicted library, which can be encoded with degenerate codons to test experimentally (17). The best-performing variant is then used as the parent sequence for the next round of evolution with mutations at new positions.Validation on an Empirical Fitness Landscape. We first investigated this machine learning-assisted approach on the large empirical fitness landscape of Wu et al. (16), who studied protein G domain B1 (GB1) binding to an antibody. Specifically, we compare the final fitnesses reached by simulated directed evolution with and without machine learning based on testing the same number of variants. The empirica",
        "discussion": "DiscussionWe have shown that machine learning can be used to quickly screen a full recombination library in silico by using sequencefitness relationships randomly sampled from the library. The predictions for the most-fit sequences are useful when incorporated into directed evolution. By sampling large regions of sequence space in silico to reduce in vitro screening efforts, we rapidly evolved a single parent enzyme to generate variants that selectively form both product enantiomers of a new-to-nature C-Si bond-forming reaction. Rather than relying on identifying beneficial single mutations as other methods such as ProSAR do (13), we modeled epistatic interactions at the mutated positions by sampling the combinatorial sequence space directly and incorporating models with nonlinear interactions.Machine learning increases effective throughput by providing an efficient computational method for estimating desired properties of all possible proteins in a large library. Thus, we can take larger steps through sequence space by identifying combinations of beneficial mutations, circumventing the need for indirect paths (16) or alterations of the nature of selection (31), and potentially avoiding negative epistatic effects resulting from the accumulation of large numbers of mutations (33) that require reversion later in the evolution (34). This gives rise to protein sequences that would not be found just by recombining the best amino acids at each position. Allowing simultaneous incorporation of multiple mutations accelerates directed evolution by navigating different regions of the fitness landscape concurrently and avoiding scenarios in which the search for beneficial mutations ends in low-fitness regions of sequence space.Importantly, machine learning-assisted directed evolution also results in solutions that appear quite distinct. For example, proline is conserved at residue 49 in two of the most (S)-selective variants. Proline is considered unique for the conformational rigidity it confers, and at first may seem structurally important, if not critical, for protein function. However, tyrosine and arginine are also tolerated at position 49 with less than 1% loss in enantioselectivity. This suggests that there are diverse solutions in protein space for specific properties, as has also recently been shown in protein design (8). Computational models make abstractions ",
        "methods": "Materials and MethodsApproach Validation on an Empirical Fitness Landscape. Fitness values were provided for 149,361 of 160,000 total possible sequences covering four positions in human protein GB1, where fitness was defined as the enrichment of folded protein bound to IgG-Fc antibody as measured by coupling mRNA display with next-generation sequencing (16). We used only measured sequences and did not incorporate imputed values of variants that were not measured directly. Three directed evolution approaches were simulated on this landscape: (i) a single-mutation walk, (ii ) simulated recombination, and (iii ) directed evolution with machine learning. For (i ), the algorithm proceeds as follows: (1) from a starting sequence, every possible single mutation (19N variants for N positions) is made and evaluated; (2) the best single mutation is fixed in the reference sequence, and the position it was found in is locked from further editing;(3) steps ( 1) and ( 2) are repeated until every position has been tested, for a total of four rounds to cover four positions. (ii) Simulated recombination proceeds by selecting 527 random variants and recombining the mutations found in the top three variants, for an average of 570 variants tested over 10,000 simulations. (iii) Directed evolution with machine learning proceeds as follows: (1) 470 randomly selected sequences in the combinatorial space are used to train shallow neural networks with randomized hyperparameter search from fourfold cross-validation based on Pearson's r. Errors are then calculated based on 1,000 randomly selected variants that were not present in the training set. (2) The optimal model is used to predict the top 100 sequences, or the approximate screening capacity of a plate. (3) The highest true fitness value in this predicted set of 100 sequences and the training set of 470 is the maximum fitness value found. This process was repeated with different numbers of random sequences in (i ) to simulate lower model accuracies, the results of which are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1A. In Fig. 2, 100 variants was used as the size of the predicted library test for its similarity to the screening capacity of a 96well plate. With 570 total variants (SI Appendix, Library Coverage), this leaves 470 variants for the input library in (1) for an equal screening burden, assuming 95% coverage of 19 mutations from WT at ",

Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine-learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validated this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein, demonstrating that machine learningguided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (i.e., stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si-H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93% and 79% ee (enantiomeric excess). By greatly increasing throughput with in silico modeling, machine learning enhances the quality and diversity of sequence solutions for a protein engineering problem.protein engineering | machine learning | directed evolution | enzyme | catalysis N ature provides countless proteins with untapped potential for technological applications. Rarely optimal for their envisioned human uses, nature's proteins benefit from sequence engineering to enhance performance. Successful engineering is no small feat, however, as protein function is determined by a highly tuned and dynamic ensemble of states (1). In some cases, engineering to enhance desirable features can be accomplished reliably by directed evolution, in which beneficial mutations are identified and accumulated through an iterative process of mutation and testing of hundreds to thousands of variants in each generation (2)(3)(4). However, implementing a suitable screen or selection can represent a significant experimental burden.Given that screening is the bottleneck and most resourceintensive step for the majority of directed evolution efforts, devising ways to screen protein variants in silico is highly attractive. Molecular-dynamics simulations, which predict dynamic structural changes for protein variants, have been used to predict chang"

        "intro": "IntroductionThe (re-) design of better or even novel molecules is the overall goal of protein engineering (Forrer et al., 1999). In recent years, the emergence of 'directed evolution' approaches (Steipe, 1999;Petrounia and Arnold, 2000;Arnold, 2001;Wintrode and Arnold, 2001) has strongly facilitated the targeted improvement of enzymes. Directed evolution has been used for improving the thermo-and solvent stability, the catalytic properties, and even the expression rate of proteins; however, directed evolution strongly depends on a highly discriminating screening assay or selection protocol, which may not always be available or may not even be feasible.Besides the rather successful directed evolution approaches, stabilizing amino acid substitutions have been predicted successfully using various rational concepts and/or by comparison with the sequence or 3D-structure of a homologous protein from a thermophilic organism. The success rate in most of these cases has been rather low. One of the most prominent exceptions has been reported by van den Burg et al. (van den Burg et al., 1998) who applied different rational and semirational approaches to the stabilization of a thermolysin-like protease. They came up with a mutant showing a 21°C increase in thermostability which allowed the protease to be active at 100°C. Furthermore, a computational method is now available that combines (i) potential functions that model a protein sequence's compatibility with a structure, and (ii) fast optimization tools that can search the huge number of sequence possibilities (Dahiyat, 1999). This method was used, for example, to predict seven stabilizing point mutations, combination of which enhanced the unfolding temperature of the β1 domain of streptococcal protein G from 81°C to Ͼ100°C (Malakauskas and Mayo, 1998).Recently, we presented a new semi-rational 'consensus' approach for increasing the thermostability of proteins (Lehmann et al., 2000). The approach is based on the comparison of amino acid sequences of homologous proteins and the subsequent calculation of a consensus amino acid sequence using one of the available standard programs. Applying this approach to the family of fungal phytases, which at that time consisted of sequences from 13 different ascomycetes (Table I), resulted in a consensus phytase that exhibited a 15-22°C increase in its unfolding temperature compare",
        "methods": "Other methodsProtein concentrations were determined using the enzyme extinction coefficients at 280 nm calculated according to Pace et al. (Pace et al., 1995). One absorption unit (1 OD) at 280 nm corresponds to 1.10 mg/ml of consensus phytase-1 and 1.04 mg/ml of consensus phytase-10.",
        "results": "Results",
        "discussion": "DiscussionPreviously, we designed a novel consensus amino acid sequence, not occurring in nature, from the sequences of 13 homologous fungal phytases. Surprisingly, this consensus phytase-1 had a 15-26°C higher thermostability than its parental phytases (Lehmann et al., 2000). To further test the general validity of the consensus approach for thermostability engineering of proteins, the amino acid sequence alignment was complemented with a phytase sequence from T.lanuginosus and with five phytase sequences from four different basidiomycete fungi. The amended alignments were used to calculate two further consensus phytase amino acid sequences (consensus phytases-10 and -11). Consensus phytase-10 differs in 32 amino acid residues from the original consensus phytase-1 and displayed an unfolding temperature that is another 7.4°C higher than that of consensus phytase-1.When most of the 32 differing residues were tested as single mutations in consensus phytase-1, 10 replacements had a positive effect on the protein's stability, 10 had a negative effect, and eight replacements were neutral. Four residues were not tested. All amino acid exchanges affected the thermostability by Ͻ3°C in our test system. These results indicate that the observed 7.4°C increase in unfolding temperature of consensus phytase-10 relative to consensus phytase-1 is the combined effect of multiple stabilizing amino acid replacements that are distributed over the entire protein. It is, thus, not the result of a single dominant mutation that was introduced just by chance. This interpretation in all likelihood also applies to the 15-26°C increase in unfolding temperature of consensus phytase-1 over the proteins used for its design.We have shown-in accordance with findings from Steipe et al. (Steipe et al., 1994)-that the consensus approach does not always select the most stabilizing amino acid for a given position of an amino acid sequence alignment. As shown by site-directed mutagenesis (Table III), 10 amino acid substitutions newly introduced in consensus phytase-10 as compared to consensus phytase-1 had a destabilizing effect relative to the original amino acid residue. Combining only the amino acid exchanges in consensus phytase-1 that showed a stabilizing effect resulted in a protein, consensus phytase-1-thermo [11] (that also harbors a substitution derived from consensus phytase-11), that ",
        "other": "MaterialsPhytic acid (dodecasodium salt) was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Unless specified otherwise, A.fumigatus and consensus phytases were purified from the supernatants of transformed Hansenula polymorpha or Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Despite extensive investigations (Wyss et al., 1999a,b;and unpublished data), there is no indication that the temperature optima, T m s and specific activities of the phytases under investigation are affected by the host strain used for phytase production.\n\nDesign of the consensus phytasesThe amino acid sequence alignments used for the design of the different consensus phytases (Table I) were calculated with the program PILEUP from the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Package, Release 9.0 (Devereux et al., 1984) by using standard parameters (gap creation penalty 12, gap extension penalty 4). The location of the gaps was refined using a text editor. The consensus sequences were calculated with the program PRETTY which is also part of the GCG package. Plurality was set at 2.0, threshold at 3, and the 404 scoring matrix used was prettypep.cmp. The origin and the vote weight of the individual phytase amino acid sequences used in the respective calculations are shown in Table I. The impact of very similar amino acid sequences that originate from different strains of one fungal species was restricted to 1 by assigning appropriate vote weights to them. The design of the consensus sequence was restricted to the mature protein.For secretion of the protein, the first 26 amino acid residues of Aspergillus terreus cbs116.46 phytase were used as signal peptide and fused to the N-termini of consensus phytases-1 and -10.\n\nGene constructionCalculation of the DNA sequences, construction of the synthetic genes, cloning of the consensus phytase genes into the expression vector pFP, transformation of the methylotrophic yeast H.polymorpha, and purification of the consensus phytases expressed in H.polymorpha were performed as described previously (Lehmann et al., 2000).For expression in S.cerevisiae, the consensus phytase genes were ligated into the EcoRI site of the plasmid RO11, which contains a shortened version of the constitutive GAPFL (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) promoter and the terminator of the pho5 gene from S.cerevisiae, as described by Janes et al."

        "intro": "Evolution by the GSSM methodThe xylanase used for this work (XYL7746, internal nomenclature) was discovered from a complex environmental DNA library (Robertson et al. 1996;Short 1997Short , 1999Short , 2001a) ) derived from a sample of fresh bovine manure. XYL7746 is a 20-kD protein belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 11 (Coutinho and Henrissat 1999a,b). The mature xylanase shares 83% sequence identity with the family 11 xylanase from Bacillus circulans (GenBank accession AAM08360). A number of commercial xylanases belong to family 11 (Kulkarni et al. 1999;Beg et al. 2001), and as such, we were interested in exploring the possibility of improving the thermal properties of a family 11 xylanase.The GSSM method (Short 2001b) was used to create a comprehensive library of point mutations in gene XYL7746. A screen for thermotolerance was developed that measures residual xylanase activity following a temperature challenge above the melting point of the wild-type enzyme. This xylanase thermotolerance screen identified nine single-site amino acid mutants (D8F, Q11H, N12L, G17I, G60H, P64V, S65V, G68A, and S79P; Fig. 1A) that had improved thermal tolerance relative to the wild-type enzyme (as measured following a heat challenge at 80°C for 20 min; see Materials and Methods). Wild-type enzyme and all nine single-site amino acid mutants were produced in Escherichia coli and purified utilizing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. There was no noticeable difference in activity due to the tag (data not shown).To determine the effect of the single amino acid mutations on enzymatic activity, all nine mutants were purified and their xylanase activity (initial rates at the wild-type temperature optimum, 70°C) was compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme activities were comparable to wild type (initial rate normalized to 1.0) for D8F, N12L, G17I, G60H, P64V, S65V, G68A, and S79P mutants (relative initial rates 0.65, 0.68, 0.76, 1.1, 1.0, 1.2, 0.98, and 0.84, respectively) confirming that these mutations do not significantly alter the enzymatic activity. (Initial rates were measured three or more times, and variance was typically less than 10%.) In contrast to these eight mutants, a notable reduction in enzymatic activity was observed for the best thermal tolerant, single-site mutant, Q11H (relative initial rate 0.35).",
        "discussion": "DiscussionA combination of laboratory gene evolution strategies was used to rapidly generate a highly active and thermostable xylanase optimized for process compatibility in a number of industrial market applications. GSSM methodology was employed to scan the entire sequence of a xylanase (XYL7746) and to identify nine point mutations that improve its thermal tolerance.Although it had no discernable effect on the hydrolysis product profile of the enzyme (Fig. 4), the addition of the nine mutations to the protein sequence resulted in a moderate reduction in enzymatic specific activity at the wild-type temperature optimum (70°C; Fig. 3B). Using the GeneReassembly method to generate a combinatorial library of the nine single-site amino acid mutants, this reduction in activity was overcome. Ten thermostable variants (T m s between 89°C and 94°C) with activity better than the 9X variant were obtained from screening the GeneReassembly (C) Thermal stability of wild-type and evolved 9X mutant enzymes. Thermal dependence of activity of the wild-type and evolved 9X mutant enzymes was measured by first heating the enzymes at each of the indicated temperatures for 5 min followed by cooling to room temperature and the measurement of residual activity (initial rate at 37°C [pH 6.0]). For all experiments initial rates were measured two or more times, and the variation was less than 10%. For comparison, the data are shown normalized at the wild-type maximum for each condition.library. With a T m of 90°C, enzymatic specific activity surpassing the wild type and a product fingerprint unaltered and comparable to the wild type, the 6X-2 variant is particularly notable. To our knowledge the shift in T m obtained for these variants is the highest increase reported from the application of directed evolution technologies or by rational design.To gauge the effectiveness of combinatorial mixing versus addition of the point mutants to the desired phenotype, a fitness parameter combining contributions both from changes in enzyme activity and thermal stability was calculated for each mutant. The term fitness as described here is not an objective measure that can be compared to other enzymes, but rather a term that allows the measurement of the success of directed evolution of this particular xylanase. Because enzyme fitness, F, is calculated by equally weighting changes in T m and enzym",

        "other": "Naturally thermostable proteins have been studied extensively to gain insight into the adaptive mechanisms for achieving thermostability and to decipher the general rules that could be applied to stabilizing other mesophilic proteins. Enzyme sequences from mesophilic organisms have been compared to their homologs from thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms in efforts to identify the interactions responsible for conferring enhanced thermostability (Adams 1993;Ladenstein and Antranikian 1998;Britton et al. 1999;Kinjo and Nishikawa 2001). Numerous mutagenesis studies have also explored this phenomenon; however, the mechanisms that mediate protein thermostabilization are still poorly understood (Adams and Kelly 1998;Farinas et al. 2001). Considerable amino acid sequence differences between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins greatly complicate attempts to identify specific substitutions that affect thermostability. Moreover, large changes in thermostability are usually the result of cumulative small contributions of a number of mutations (van den Burg et al. 1998;Gray et al. 2001). Rules for engineering substantial protein stability by rational design are likely to be protein specific, and any such design effort in combination with structural information is currently beyond state of the art approaches.A more facile, nonrational approach to improving the thermal properties of an enzyme is directed evolution. We have used Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis (GSSM) technology (Short 2001b) in combination with GeneReassembly technology (Short 2003) to evolve thermostability characteristics into an enzyme. The GSSM method is a highly efficient mutagenesis technique that can be used to random-ize successive codons in a gene, systematically generating a library of enzyme variants representing all possible 19 amino acid substitutions at each residue position. It is most powerful when used in combination with GeneReassembly technology to randomly combine single beneficial amino acid substitutions, allowing the identification of protein variants with optimal fitness, in this case, increased thermostability, while preserving optimal catalytic activity.For this enzyme evolution study, we have chosen to optimize the thermostability of a xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) because of the many potential commercial applications of a stable enzyme for hydrolysis of plant-derived xyla"

        "intro": "INTRODUCTIONNature is a masterful and prolific chemist. The ever-expanding catalog of natural products from plants and microbes currently stands at more than 100,000 different compounds (58). This collection has profoundly influenced human well-being. Natural products have been used to treat pain, infections, and disease for thousands of years; their equally ancient and diverse uses as colorants, spices, fragrances, aphrodisiacs, cosmetics, and toxins have been fundamental to human culture and development. This trend shows no signs of subsiding. Of the 877 new small-molecule pharmacological entities introduced worldwide between 1981 and 2002, 61% can be traced to natural products (142). A similar proportion (59%) of the 137 small molecules in phase II or III clinical trials for cancer treatment (as of June 2003) are natural products or closely related compounds (172). Natural products and their derivatives therefore remain an essential component of the pharmaceutical industry (172). Given the wealth of functional small molecules in nature, it is perhaps not surprising that so much effort today goes into prospecting for new ones or modifying existing ones. Academic and industrial laboratories, often in massive screening programs, continue to isolate and characterize promising new compounds from biological extracts. In addition, molecular scaffolds inspired by natural products are increasingly being used as the basis for synthesizing combinatorial chemical libraries which can be screened for protein-binding or other biochemical activities (30).Although impressive in number, the known products of natural biosynthetic pathways account for but a tiny fraction of the structures that could be produced. This essentially infinite space of possible functional molecules represents an irresistible frontier for those seeking new, bioactive compounds. For example, only 1/10 of the 877 new small-molecule pharmacological entities mentioned above are bona fide natural products-most are derivatives of natural products, synthetic compounds with natural product-derived moieties, or natural-product mimics (142). The chemical space surrounding natural products is particularly rich in biologically functional molecules, and structurally related compounds can serve human purposes even better than natural products themselves. Researchers are now beginning to explore some of these nea",

        "conclusion": "CONCLUSIONSIn its short history, laboratory pathway evolution has produced more than 30 carotenoids that have never been seen in nature. With the ability to make new backbones in E. coli comes the potential to generate whole families of novel carotenoids through the action of wild-type or laboratory-evolved carotenoid-modifying enzymes on the new carbon scaffolds. Applied to other biosynthetic pathways, laboratory pathway evolution could allow researchers to access thousands of molecules that are difficult to produce in practical quantities by synthetic chemistry, are expensive to isolate from natural sources, or have not been found in nature.Seeing is believing. Evolving carotenoid biosynthetic pathways in the laboratory has allowed us to witness first-hand their remarkable evolutionary potential. In the process, we have learned that carotenoid enzymes can acquire new specificities that allow them to accept different substrates, function in a foreign pathway, make a different product from the same substrate, and even give rise to new pathways. Furthermore, all of these changes can be effected in just one round of evolution and are usually brought about by a single amino acid substitution. As evolution proceeds, we will gain further, detailed information on how pathways diverge and, we hope, some elementary understanding of how the stringent specificity of enzymes and pathways we see in nature is achieved at the molecular level.We wonder how far laboratory pathway evolution can be taken. For example, starting with the genes that make up an arbitrary biosynthetic pathway in nature, can we evolve any chemically possible pathway made up of the same basic transformations? We have seen that the carotenoid synthase CrtM can rapidly acquire new specificities, lose much of its original function, and yet quickly recover its original function via different mutational routes. This is an encouraging lesson: evolving an enzyme with narrowed specificity does not \"paint it into a corner,\" evolutionarily speaking. It seems that one can abolish a particular specificity with ease but cannot abolish an enzyme's inherent ability to evolve. Thus, the enzymes that exist in 2005 may be perfectly good starting points for creating widely diverse pathways.The dramatic functional changes we see in laboratory pathway evolution experiments remind us that natural product biosynthetic pat",
        "other": "Overview of Carotenoid Biosynthetic PathwaysThe carotenoids are a subfamily of the isoprenoids and are among the most widespread of all natural products. Carotenoids are responsible for many of the colors of animals, plants, and microorganisms and play important biological roles as accessory light-harvesting components of photosynthetic systems, photoprotecting antioxidants, and regulators of membrane fluidity. As a whole, the natural C 30 and C 40 carotenoid biosynthetic pathways can be organized in a tree-like hierarchy (Fig. 1), with the trunk representing the initial, universal step of backbone synthesis catalyzed by a carotenoid synthase and the outward-emanating branches and subbranches collectively denoting the various downstream modification steps seen in different species (8). The hundreds of known carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes fall into relatively few classes, based on the types of transformation they catalyze (isoprenyl diphosphate synthases, carotenoid synthases, desaturases, cyclases, etc.). The enzymes responsible for various versions of a basic transfor-mation are related by evolution (111,163,176): the pathways diverged on accumulation of mutations that altered enzyme specificity. Thus, a small number of basic transformations, subtly modified in different species, collectively lead to a large number of different products, although only a handful of carotenoids (usually a few and almost always fewer than ϳ10) are made by any one organism.C 40 carotenoids are made in thousands of plant and microbial species, starting with the synthase-catalyzed condensation of two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (C 20 PP) to form phytoene (Fig. 1). (Most phytoene synthases produce the 15Z isomer of phytoene [87].) Different types and levels of modification of this C 40 backbone account for the majority of known carotenoids. C 30 carotenoid pathways starting with the condensation of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (C 15 PP) to form (15Z)-4,4Ј-diapophytoene (also called dehy-drosqualene) are much less widespread, having been found only in a small number of bacteria such as Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Heliobacterium, and Methylobacterium species (55,100,101,129,130,198,205,206). These initial C 30 and C 40 condensation products are dehydrogenated in a stepwise manner by desaturase enzymes, which represent the next important branch points for pat"

      "abstract": "Directed evolution of computationally designed enzymes has provided new insights into the emergence of sophisticated catalytic sites in proteins. In this regard, we have recently shown that a histidine nucleophile and a flexible arginine can work in synergy to accelerate the Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction with unrivalled efficiency. Here, we show that replacing the catalytic histidine with a non-canonical Nδ-methylhistidine (MeHis23) nucleophile leads to a substantially altered evolutionary outcome in which the catalytic Arg124 has been abandoned. Instead, a Glu26 has emerged, which mediates a rate-limiting proton transfer step to deliver an enzyme (BHMeHis1.8) that is an order of magnitude more active than our earlier MBHase. Interestingly, the MeHis nucleophile of BHMeHis1.8 can be replaced by a canonical histidine with only a modest, 4-fold reduction in kcat. However, analysis of the BHMeHis1.8 evolutionary trajectory reveals that the non-canonical nucleophile was crucial in the early stages of engineering to unlock the new mechanistic pathway. This study demonstrates how even subtle perturbations to key catalytic elements of designed enzymes can lead to vastly different evolutionary outcomes, resulting in new mechanistic solutions to complex chemical transformations.",

        "intro": "IntroductionComputational enzyme design offers exciting opportunities to develop enzymes with catalytic mechanisms and functions that are beyond those found in nature. 1,2 Powerful programs such as ORBIT, 3 RosettaMatch and RosettaDesign 2,4,5 have allowed the design of protein catalysts for a range of transformations, including Diels-Alder cycloadditions, 6 Kemp eliminations, 7,8 and retro-aldol reactions. 9 Although the efficiencies of these designs have been relatively low, they can be optimized through directed evolution to generate proficient catalysts, in some cases with efficiencies approaching natural enzymes. [10][11][12][13][14] Recently, our lab and others have shown how an expanded genetic code can be used to broaden the range of catalytic mechanisms that can be embedded into proteins. [15][16][17][18][19][20] Of particular note, we have shown that the non-canonical amino acid Nδ-methylhistidine (MeHis) can serve as a competent catalytic nucleophile for the development of de novo hydrolases. 20 In this case, histidine methylation is important for catalytic function as it avoids the formation of unreactive acyl-enzyme intermediates that compromise the activity of designed hydrolases equipped with canonical nucleophiles. 21,22 MeHis can thus be considered a genetically encodable surrogate of the widely employed nucleophilic catalyst DMAP, 23 and essentially serves as a condensed version of the catalytic triad commonly found in natural hydrolases.In light of the favourable catalytic properties of MeHis, we wondered whether this non-canonical amino acid would also serve as a superior nucleophile when developing enzymes for more complex chemical transformations. To explore this hypothesis, we looked to our recently engineered enzyme (BH32.14) for enantioselective Morita-Baylis-Hillman reactions, 13 which involve the coupling of activated alkenes with carbon electrophiles (Figure 1A). MBH reactions are valuable carbon-carbon bond forming transformations in organic synthesis, for which no natural enzymes are known. [24][25][26] To develop BH32.14, we subjected a modestly active computational design (BH32) to extensive evolutionary optimization (Figure 1B), affording a biocatalyst that is orders of magnitude more efficient than analogous small molecule catalysts. 13,27 BH32.14 catalysis relies on a designed His23 nucleophile paired with a flexible Arg124",

        "conclusion": "ConclusionsIn this study, an expanded genetic code has allowed us to explore divergent evolutionary trajectories where the only distinguishing feature was the identity of the key catalytic nucleophile. Interestingly, introduction of a non-canonical nucleophile led to a dramatically altered evolutionary outcome, giving rise to a more efficient biocatalyst and providing a new mechanistic solution to the MBH reaction. Our work suggests that the strategy of replacing of key catalytic elements of designed enzymes by subtly altered analogues can allow us to efficiently shift onto new evolutionary trajectories. In contrast to our previously designed hydrolase, where catalysis was strictly dependent on MeHis, 20 a MeHis to His substitution is well tolerated in BHMeHis1.8. Given the increased cost of producing enzymes with noncanonical amino acids, this His23 variant may serve as a more valuable starting point for developing practically useful MBHases in the future. In summary, this work further underscores how the wider range of functional components enabled by an expanded genetic code presents exciting opportunities for developing biocatalysts with new and improved functions.",

        "other": "Evolution of a proficient MBHase with a non-canonical MeHis nucleophileTo identify a suitable starting template for engineering a MeHis-containing MBHase, we replaced the His23 nucleophile of BH32 and selected evolved descendants with MeHis using an engineered pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase_tRNA pair. 28 These variants were evaluated for activity towards the MBH coupling of 2-cyclohexen-1-one (1) and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (2) (Figure 1A). In contrast to the improved hydrolytic activity observed upon His23MeHis substitution in BH32, 20 MBH activity was reduced upon MeHis incorporation across all BH32 variants (Figure 1C, Supplementary Figure 1). Of the modified variants tested, BH32.8 His23MeHis (subsequently referred to as BHMeHis1.0) was found to have the highest activity and was selected for further engineering. It is interesting to note that while evolutionary progression from BH32.8 to BH32.14 led to a 20-fold increase in MBH activity with His as a nucleophile, the analogous progression with MeHis23 led to a reduction in activity (Figure 1C). BHMeHis1.0 was also found to have an altered pH optimum compared to BH32.8, with the highest conversion observed at pH 6.0 (Supplementary Figure 2).To improve enzyme activity, BHMeHis1.0 was subjected to successive rounds of laboratory evolution. Individual library variants were arrayed in 96-well plates and evaluated as clarified cell lysate using a UPLC assay monitoring conversion of 1 and 2 to MBH adduct 3. The evolutionary strategy employed a combination of local and global mutagenesis (See Supplementary Table 1).

Following evaluation of >18,000 clones, a BHMeHis1.8 variant emerged containing 23 mutations (Figure 2A and B).

[10][11][12][13][14] Recently, our lab and others have shown how an expanded genetic code can be used to broaden the range of catalytic mechanisms that can be embedded into proteins. [15][16][17][18][19][20] Of particular note, we have shown that the non-canonical amino acid Nδ-methylhistidine (MeHis) can serve as a competent catalytic nucleophile for the development of de novo hydrolases. 20 In this case, histidine methylation is important for catalytic function as it avoids the formation of unreactive acyl-enzyme intermediates that compromise the activity of designed hydrolases equipped with canonical nucleophiles. 21,22 MeHis can thus be considered a genetically encodable surrogate of the widely employed nucleophilic catalyst DMAP, 23 and essentially serves as a condensed version of the catalytic triad commonly found in natural hydrolases.In light of the favourable catalytic properties of MeHis, we wondered whether this non-canonical amino acid would also serve as a superior nucleophile when developing enzymes for more complex chemical transformations.",
