Key advances in DNA sequencing and gene synthesis are at the base of tremendous progress in tailoring biocatalysts by protein engineering and design, and the ability to reorganize enzymes into new biosynthetic pathways. To highlight these achievements, here we discuss applications of protein-engineered biocatalysts ranging from commodity chemicals to advanced pharmaceutical intermediates that use enzyme catalysis as a key step."

The field of biocatalysis has reached its present industrially proven level through several waves of technological research and innovations.\n\nDuring the first wave of biocatalysis (Fig. 1), which started more than a century ago, scientists recognized that components of living cells could be applied to useful chemical transformations (in contrast to the fermentation processes, which had been commonplace for millennia already). For example, Rosenthaler synthesized (R)-mandelonitrile from benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide using a plant extract 6 ; hydroxylation of steroids 7 occurring within microbial cells was also known. More recent examples are the use of proteases in laundry detergents 8 , glucose isomerase to convert glucose to the sweeter-tasting fructose 9 , and penicillin G acylase to make semisynthetic antibiotics 10 . The main challenge for these applications is the limited stability of the biocatalyst, and such shortcomings were primarily overcome by immobilization of the enzyme, which also facilitated the reuse of the enzyme.\n\nDuring the second wave of biocatalysis, in the 1980s and 1990s, initial protein engineering technologies, typically structure based, extended the substrate range of enzymes to allow the synthesis of unusual synthetic intermediates.

Engineering enzymes for such a process starts by defining the engineering goal, such as increased stability, selectivity, substrate range or, typically, a combination thereof. In 2000, before the third wave, only a few strategies were available to meet these goals. Enzyme immobilization could increase the stability of a protein, but the increases in stability were moderate and often insufficient for most chemical transformations. Directed evolution was also possible, but was still slow because it required construction and screening of large libraries that mostly contained variants with reduced, or even no, activity. Examples of drastic improvements were rarely of industrial relevance. The slow pace meant that the evolved proteins contained only a few changes and, thus, that the enzyme properties changed only slightly. Although several hundred enzymatic processes already had industrial uses 4 , most involved enzymes and whole cells that had been marginally altered genetically 29 .\n\nIn the past decade, our understanding of proteins and the number of available directed evolution strategies have both increased, making it possible to make large changes in enzyme properties.

Multiple sequence alignments across large enzyme families and homology searches have identified genes with similar catalytic activities, leading to novel, potent biocatalysts 40 . The same sequence information allows the reconstruction of ancestral biocatalysts 40 , which may have broader substrate range and catalytic promiscuity (see below). Multiple sequence alignments identify the most common amino acids at each position (the consensus sequence) and amino-acid substitutions that yield stable function enzymes. This data helps in the design of small libraries with a high proportion of catalytically active variants. These libraries have been used to discover biocatalysts with enhanced stabilities, catalytic functions and altered stereoselectivities 41 .\n\nParalleling the advances in sequence-based protein engineering, structure-guided approaches have benefited from a rapid increase in protein structure coordinates deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http:// www.pdb.org). Over the past decade, the repository has grown by over 450% to contain more than 77,000 protein structures.

          "text": "As predicted by Schmid et al. in their forward-looking review in 2001 29 , continuous regeneration of cofactors and a wider range of enzymes have been reported in the past ten years. However, the predicted applications of biochips and combinatorial biocatalysis have not yet materialized. The use of non-metabolizing cells for biocatalysis has proven to be more difficult than predicted and preference has instead shifted towards engineered enzymes used in crude and semipurified form. Whereas historically whole cells offered a simple and effective option for cofactor regeneration and enhanced enzyme stability, protein engineering and the use of single enzymes is now considered more economic and practical. The use of isolated enzymes have other advantages: they are easier to remove (less is added because they have more activity per unit mass), they tolerate harsher conditions, they eliminate potential diffusion limitations caused by cell membranes and they are easier to ship around the world. For example, KRED-based processes have now replaced whole-cell reductions and metal-ligand-based chemocatalysis, which were the industry standards during the past decade 45,46 .

Moreover, the whole-cell process required no metabolic flux controls and proceeded without undesired side reactions. KREDs and other enzymes have been widely investigated for the manufacture of chiral intermediates for pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor, which is a cholesterol-lowering drug that had global sales of US$11,900,000,000 in 2010. Seven enzymatic approaches 2,49,50 (Fig. 3), differing not only in the choice of enzyme and starting material but also as to whether the product is a raw material (with a single chiral centre) or an advanced intermediate (with two chiral centres), have been developed. In all cases, success requires protein engineering to improve the reaction rate, the enantioselectivity, the stability to high substrate concentrations (up to 3 M, as in the nitrilase process 51 ) or the stability to high solvent concentrations (20% butylacetate in the KRED process 52 ).

Examples include a penem intermediate (8), pseudoephedrine (12) and phenylephrine (13), as well as similar processes for chiral amines (20). Also, aldolases are now being used for subsequent reaction steps to generate multiple chiral centres, for example in the synthesis of statin intermediates (33).

The US Environmental Protection Agency awards five prizes each year in the Presidential Green Chemistry Award Challenge. The nominations emphasize the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry 53 , which consider environmental factors as well as use of renewable feedstocks, energy efficiency and worker safety. Biocatalysis, using either enzyme technology or whole cells, has won 16 awards since 2000 (Table 2). Biocatalysts are made from renewable sources and are biodegradable and non-toxic, and their high selectivities simplify reaction work-ups and provide product in higher yields. Biocatalytic processes are also safe as they typically run at ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure and neutral pH. Hence, it is not surprising that so many of the awards go to biocatalysis.\n\nThe broad range of awards in Table 2 shows the application of biocatalysts beyond the pharmaceutical industry. Several applications involve polymers, especially polyesters.

However, simultaneous multiple amino-acid substitutions create exponentially more variants for testing. There are 7,183,900 possibilities for two substitutions anywhere in a 200 amino-acid protein and 9,008,610,600 possibilities for three substitutions. Many of these variants are inactive, and either all are created and tested to find the improved variants, or the library is screened only partially and incremental improvements in subsequent rounds of evolution are required.\n\nThe simplest solution to this problem is more efficient screening. Changes in substrate specificity may be monitored by high-throughput methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting [55][56][57] , which can screen tens of millions of variants in a short amount of time. Whittle and Shanklin made six simultaneous substitutions in the active site of a desaturase and then screened for growth on a different substrate.

Beyond stoichiometric reagent use, catalysis offers significant benefits, and today, increasing emphasis is being placed on biologically mediated chemical reactions, more generally termed bioconversion. The scope of bioconversion is very broad, and it is instructive to classify bioconversions into two main types. 1 The first type is growth-associated whole-cell bioconversion, which is usually defined as fermentation. In such cases, the reactant (often termed the substrate) is used for the production of the biocatalyst (and its maintenance), as well as the reaction of interest, and furthermore, the productivity is coupled to the growth rate of the cells (which can be low in aerobic fermentations). In contrast, biocatalytic processes can be defined as those in which the production of the biocatalyst (enzyme or \"resting\" cell) and the conversion step operate independently. Today, fermentation processes have been established for the production of a range of products (including amino acids from modified Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli). 2 Other products include lactic acid, succinic acid, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3 as well as recent attempts toward itaconic acid and adipic acid. 4 Never-theless, in this review, we shall be concerned only with this second type, namely, bioconv"

Likewise, cofactors might be used suboptimally, because they might also be used elsewhere in the metabolic network. Additionally, substrates and products can be decomposed through competing cellular reactions, thereby lowering the yield. Finally, such a scheme also has the disadvantage of potential substrate diffusional limitations into cells, which can result when non-natural substrates are used, because no active transport mechanism into the cell is available. 6 Unsurprisingly, this effect is more pronounced in the conversion of bulky substrates. 7 The second group, isolated enzyme biocatalysis, is schematically shown in Figure 1b and represents those reactions where the enzyme is used outside the cell in which it was produced. Primarily, this approach attempts to overcome the diffusional limitations of substrates into (and products out of) cells. In such cases, either the enzyme has been secreted during the fermentation or the cells need to be disrupted following fermentation (and the cell debris removed), to produce a soluble, although unpurified, enzyme. Using an unpurified protein avoids the added cost of purification. Provided that it does not contain protea"

A paradigm shift was clearly needed, from traditional concepts of reaction efficiency and selectivity, which focus largely on chemical yield, to one that assigns value to the maximization of raw materials utilization, elimination of waste, and avoidance of the use of toxic and/or hazardous substances. 14,15 There was a pressing need for alternative, cleaner chemistry that was more resource-efficient and produced less waste. As a result of increasing environmental awareness, emphasis gradually switched to waste prevention at the source as opposed to waste remediation and pollution control by end-of-pipe solutions. The U.S. Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 16 focused attention on the need to reduce environmental pollution and recognized that waste prevention at the source not only eliminates the cost of waste treatment but actually strengthens economic competitiveness through a more efficient use of raw materials. This act led to a fundamental shift in the strategy for environmental protectionfrom \"end-of-pipe\" waste treatment to waste preventionand led to the emergence of the term \"green chemistry\" at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the early 1990s.\n\nA succinct definition of green chemistry is as follows: Green chemistry ef f iciently utilizes (preferably renewable) raw materials, eliminates waste and avoids the use of toxic and/or ha"

Moreover, the growing need for cost-effective methods for the industrial synthesis of pure enantiomers of chiral drugs 26 provided an opportunity for the broad application of highly enantioselective biocatalytic methods. 27 However, at that time, widespread application was limited by the paucity of commercially available enzymes, which consisted mainly of hydrolases, such as lipases and proteases, used in food and beverage processing and laundry detergents.

Likewise, industrial implementation necessitates quantitative measures to assess improvements to processes to justify the required investment. The two oldest green metrics are atom economy 52 and the E factor, 14,53 first proposed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Atom economy (AE) is calculated by dividing the molecular weight of the product by the sum total of the molecular weights of all substances formed in the stoichiometric equation for the reaction The E factor, in contrast, is the actual amount of waste produced in the process. It takes the product yield into account, along with waste from all of the auxiliary operations, for example, solvent losses and chemicals used in workup. In the original publication, 14 waste was defined as \"everything but the desired product\", with the exception of water. The rationale for excluding water was that including it could lead to a skewing of E factors, making meaningful comparison of processes difficult. That is, an otherwise waste-free process using substantial amounts of water could be construed as being less green than a process producing much more undesirable waste but using little water.

Hence, there is a long-standing interest in nonaqueous biocatalysis. 81 However, the use of volatile organic solvents in biocatalytic processes is subject to the same caveats as organic syntheses in general. Moreover, highly polar substrates, such as carbohydrates, nucleosides, and peptides, are sparingly soluble in common organic solvents.

Indeed, a simple economic analysis of many biocatalytic processes reveals the importance of achieving sufficient product concentration leaving the reactor, to reduce the burden of water removal downstream. It should also be mentioned that, if water is used as the solvent, it still has to be treated to remove traces of organics before it can be discharged (and the complete E factor includes water). 82 Hence, high substrate concentrations (preferably 10 wt % or more), or even suspensions of substrates, should be used to limit the amount of water. Despite these challenges to the conventional wisdom of replacing some of the water with organic solvent, it remains the case that the majority of biocatalytic processes are carried out in water. Unlike many conventional chemical processes, where the purity of the product leaving the reactor reflects the downstream processing cost, in the case of aqueous-based systems, it is the product concentration that dominates, because the costs of removing water are so significant.

In addition, product recovery is easier from volatile organic solvents, and microbial contamination is eliminated. The reaction medium can also influence enzyme specificities, in particular, it can enhance or even invert the enantioselectivity (Table 2). 91 In short, medium engineering can be used to optimize the synthetic utility of enzymatic transformations. 92 On the other hand, environmental issues associated with many volatile organic solvents and polar aprotic solvents represent a serious drawback of biocatalysis in organic media.\n\nAnother drawback is that rates are generally much lower than in water. Enzymes are able to function as suspensions in organic solvents, but as one would a priori expect, the catalytic efficiency is orders of magnitude lower than that of the same enzyme dissolved in water. 93 Hence, if competing hydrolysis is not an issue, it probably makes more sense to conduct the reaction in an aqueous/organic biphasic system."

Enzymes are soluble in water and, hence, difficult and costly to recover from aqueous effluents.

Changing reaction conditions (e.g., pH or temperature), or changing reaction media, in the middle of a synthetic route (even to enable a more benign individual step) can result in a suboptimal solution overall.

A switch to the use of renewable biomass in integrated biorefineries 368 will afford environmentally beneficial reductions in the carbon footprints of chemicals, liquid fuels, and materials. A further benefit of the biobased economy could be the substitution of existing products by inherently safer, environmentally friendlier alternatives, such as biocompatible and biodegradable plastics. 369 However, the use of first-generation (1G) biomass feedstocks, such as corn and edible oil seeds, is not perceived to be a sustainable option in the longer term because of direct or indirect competition with food production. An alternative, second-generation (2G) scenario, more in line with the concept of a circular economy, involves the valorization of waste biomass, 370 such as waste lignocellulose derived from agricultural and forestry residues, triglycerides from waste cooking oil, and even food-supply-chain waste. 371 This will require the development of efficient chemo-and biocatalytic methodologies.\n\nA direct result of the impending trans"

The United States is the largest producer of biofuels, with a production of 14.7 billion gallons in 2015, 374 and uses cornstarch as the feedstock. Starch hydrolysis consists of two steps. The first step, liquefaction, is conducted at 90 °C and pH 7 and is catalyzed by α-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1), which hydrolyzes α-(1-4) glycosidic bonds. This is followed by saccharification to the fermentable sugar glucose, which involves hydrolysis of both α-(1-4) and α-(1-6) glycosidic bonds catalyzed by a second enzyme, glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3), at 60 °C and pH 5. Talekar and co-workers 375 prepared mCLEAs of αamylase with an activity recovery of 100% and used them in starch hydrolysis. Thermal and storage stability was improved compared to that of the free enzyme, and the mCLEA retained 100% of its activity after six recycles. An mCLEA of α-amylase was also prepared using pectin dialdehyde as the cross-linker with 95% activity recovery, compared to 85% using glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker. 376 The higher activity recovery was attributed to better mass transfer of macromolecular substrates in the more open porous structure.\n\nSimilarly, glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger was immobilized on magnetic polystyrene particles and used successfully in a magnetically stabilized fluidized-bed reactor (MSFBR). 377 It was necessary to use low f"

Hemicellulose has a more complicated structure than cellulose and requires a diverse suite of enzymes, including xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) and mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78), to effect its hydrolysis to its constituent sugars, mainly xylose and mannose.\n\nImmobilization of the cellulase enzyme cocktail on magnetic particles has been extensively studied, either on prefabricated magnetic (nano)carriers [384][385][386][387][388][389][390][391] or as magnetic CLEAs, [392][393][394] but activities were generally measured only in the hydrolysis of the water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a model for the complex mixture derived from lignocellulose.

Some form of pretreatment, such as a steam explosion, ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX), or treatment with lime, is needed to open up the recalcitrant lignocellulose structure and render it accessible to the enzyme cocktail. 398 Pretreatment generally accounts for a large fraction of the total energy consumption of lignocellulose conversion.

The organosolv process, for example, involves reaction at elevated temperatures (185-210 °C) in water/ organic solvent (e.g., ethanol) mixtures. 399 Alternatively, ILs and DESs are being considered as reaction media for the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. 400 The ultimate goal is to develop an integrated process for the pretreatment of the lignocellulose and enzymatic hydrolysis of the polysaccharides, coupled with efficient recycling of both the IL or DES and the (immobilized) enzyme. 401 The cellulase enzyme cocktail is known to be active and stable in designer ILs and DESs. 133 For example, cellulase was engineered to improve its stability in mixtures of ChCl/Gly and concentrated seawater as a low-cos"

It should be pointed out that biocatalytic cascades have only become more commonly used because of the advances in biocatalyst design and build discussed elsewhere in this Primer.\n\nBiocatalytic cascades 97,98 typically feature two or more steps (functional group interconversions or bond forming) with at least one enzymatic transformation and without intermediate isolations (Fig. 6a). The definition of 'cascade' is generally broadly applied within the biocatalysis community to describe not only concurrent, multienzyme processes in one pot but also reactions in which components are added sequentially or process steps are telescoped despite attempts to impart order on the nomenclature [99][100][101][102] .\n\nThe development of novel biocatalytic cascades can be broadly described by a design-build-optimize cycle (Fig. 6b) until a final process is achieved 3,103 .

          "text": "ABSTRACT: Enzymes as catalysts in synthetic organic chemistry gained importance in the latter half of the 20th century, but nevertheless suffered from two major limitations. First, many enzymes were not accessible in large enough quantities for practical applications. The advent of recombinant DNA technology changed this dramatically in the late 1970s. Second, many enzymes showed a narrow substrate scope, often poor stereo-and/or regioselectivity and/or insufficient stability under operating conditions. With the development of directed evolution beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, all of these problems can be addressed and generally solved. The present Perspective focuses on these and other developments which have popularized enzymes as part of the toolkit of synthetic organic chemists and biotechnologists. Included is a discussion of the scope and limitation of cascade reactions using enzyme mixtures in vitro and of metabolic engineering of pathways in cells as factories for the production of simple compounds such as biofuels and complex natural products. Future trends and problems are also highlighted, as is the discussion concerning biocatalysis versus nonbiological catalysis in synthetic organic chemistry. This Perspective does not constitute a comprehensive review, and therefore the author apologizes to those researchers whose work is not specifically treated here."

In more modern times it was Louis Pasteur who in 1858 placed a milestone in biocatalysis by treating an aqueous solution of racemic tartaric acid ammonium salt with a culture of the mold Penicillium glaucum, leading to the consumption of (+)-tartaric acid and concomitant enrichment of the (-)-enantiomer. 1 This can be considered to be a forerunner of enzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolution as it is widely practiced today in academia and industry. 2 Pasteur's publication was followed by Emil Fischer's monumental carbohydrate research which culminated in the lock-andkey hypothesis of stereoselective enzyme catalysis in 1894. 3a One hundred years later Albert Eschenmoser 3b and Friedrich Lichtenthaler 3c wrote enlightening essays which illuminated the impact of Fischer's hypothesis on modern chemistry, biochemistry, and immunology. Linus Pauling's hypothesis regarding the stabilization of transition states of enzyme-catalyzed reactions 4a is an extension of Fischer's idea, as is Daniel Koshland's induced fit model. 4b Another cornerstone of biocatalysis was laid by Eduard Buchner who in 1897 reported the successful fermentation of sugar by cellfree yeast extracts, which constitutes indisputable proof that biological transformations do not necessarily require living cells. 5a This paradigm shift opened the door to moder"

Traditionally, enzymes were isolated from their respective sources, these being microorganisms, fungi, insects, plants, or mammalian species. However, this was often tedious, and in many cases reasonable amounts were not accessible. This long-standing limitation constituted one of the major obstacles to generalizing biocatalysis in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology. The breakthrough, catalyzed by the work of Paul Berg, Herbert Boyer, and Stanley Cohen, came with the development of recombinant DNA methododology, according to which a given enzyme occurring in one organism can be overexpressed in another host organism. 12 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are typical host organisms.\n\nIn this way large quantities of enzymes became accessible, sometimes in ton amounts, an example being protein-based detergents produced by such companies as Henkel (Germany) or Novozyme (Denmark). In some cases enzymes cannot be expressed in the usual bacterial hosts, therefore requiring the development of alternative expression systems. 2 Biotechnological engineering of reactors, enzyme immobilization, and methods for the optimization of downstream workup contributed heavily to making biocatalysis practical and industrially viable. 2,13 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis in 1983 r"

Liese, K. Seelbach, and C. Wandrey illustrates numerous industrial applications of enzymes up to 2006 by including informative reaction flow-sheets and the applied reactor technology. 13a Other reviews likewise dispel myths regarding biocatalysis. 13b-g One of numerous examples is the BASF process for the production of chiral amines in enantiomerically pure form. 15 Racemic amines such as rac-11 are acylated with methoxyacetic acid ethyl ester (12), an appropriate lipase serving as the catalyst in kinetic resolutions characterized by very high selectivity factors (E > 200), depending upon the particular structure of the starting amine. 15 More recently a system for performing dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral amines using a racemizing Ru catalyst in combination with a lipase was developed by Backvall et al. which has the important advantage of enabling full conversion and high enantioselectivity, 16a similar to the prior development of dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols and diols. 16b,c The advantages of dynamic ki"

Site-specific mutagenesis for improving stereoselectivity, a more challenging task, was shown to be successful in some cases, 19,20c,d but due to the complexity of enzymes, generalization has not been accomplished to date. Some researchers in the 1980s generated libraries of mutants using mutating chemical agents, mutator strains, or even genetic methods and screened these for enhanced thermostability or activity. 21 However, a second mutagenesis/screening cycle, which would have exerted \"evolutionary pressure\", was not considered (with one exception). 21d In the mid-1980s the first examples of catalytic antibodies were published independently by Richard Lerner and Peter Schultz, which sparked a flurry of activities toward a possible alternative to enzymes. 22 Many fascinating studies of a variety of reacti"

          "text": "Today all of the problems listed in section 4 can be addressed by applying a different protein engineering technique called directed evolution (or laboratory evolution). 19,23 It involves repeating cycles of gene mutagenesis, expression, and screening (or selection) of mutant enzyme libraries in an overall process which simulates natural evolution. The most common gene mutagenesis methods for generating mutant libraries are\n\n• error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR)\n\n• saturation mutagenesis • DNA shuffling Since epPCR targets the whole gene and therefore the entire protein, it is a kind of shotgun method, although amino acid bias exists. 19,24a It is the most often used technique and does not require structural information about the enzyme. In a seminal study published by Frances Arnold in 1993, several rounds of epPCR were applied in order to increase the robustness of the protease subtilisin E toward the hostile solvent dimethylformamide. 24b Later this approach was extended by many groups to include the enhancement of thermostability using epPCR and other genetic techniques. 19,25 As synthetic organic chemists, my group became interested in laboratory evolution back in 1995 because we wanted to control a catalytic parameter which is at the heart of modern organic synthesis, namely stereoselectivity. As schematized in Figure 1, it is a logical strategy for generating enzyme mutants as catalysts in asymmetric transformations. 26 Each cycle exerts evolutionary pressure"

To this day screening is the bottleneck of directed evolution. 19,23,27 Unfortunately, few studies focus on systematic comparisons, which means that it often not clear which mutagenesis strategy is in fact optimal. 37 In an early example concerning the transformation of a β-galactosidase into a β-fucosidase, Matsumura et al. demonstrated that saturation mutagenesis is more efficient than DNA shuffling, but the authors were careful not to generalize. 37a In the case of the lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of rac-16 (section 6), the best strategy available in 2001 utilized mainly epPCR and DNA shuffling, 26c but a subsequent QM/MM study predicted that of the six point mutations of the best mutant showing E = 51, four are superfluous. 38 Indeed, the double mutant was generated and shown to be even more selective (E = 63). While this was a triumph of theory, it indicated inefficiency of the mutagenesis procedure which had been applied. Extensive deconvolution of all point mutations of a variant in a given enzyme system is necessary to uncover any superfluous mutations, but this is rarely done. 23a Efficacy would not be so crucial if selection instead of screening systems could be used in a general way in which the host organism experiences a growth advantage because it houses improved mutant enzy"

Morley et al. 26 analyzed results from their own work and from the work of other groups and concluded that in general, closer mutations are more beneficial, particularly in terms of the effect that they have on substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. Reetz et al. [27][28][29] have developed a very useful method termed iterative CASTing (combinatorial active site testing) in which active site residues are selected and organized into groups of two or three residues from which libraries can be subsequently generated. Screening of these initial libraries is undertaken, the hits from these libraries are combined, and new libraries are generated and are further screened in an iterative fashion. Clearly either a crystal structure or homology model is required for CASTing to be applied. Another approach to reduce the screening effort "

          "text": "A powerful theme that has recently emerged and that is highly relevant to directed evolution of enzymes is that of promiscuous activities [32][33][34] . Enzyme promiscuity refers to situations where an enzyme is able to catalyze a reaction that is quite distinct from its natural function but for which there are links between the two chemical transformations at the mechanistic rather than structural level. In order to try to understand the relationship between promiscuity and evolution of function, both Tawfik and Arnold have recently introduced the concept of neutral drift [35][36][37][38][39] . Neutral drift is the gradual accumulation of mutations under selection to maintain a protein's original function and structure. Such drifts have been demonstrated experimentally in the laboratories of Arnold and Tawfik by generating libraries and then screening for the original function rather than a new function. For example, Gupta et al. 38 studied the neutral drift of serum paraoxonase (PON1) and found that almost half of the 311 neutral variants that were characterized exhibited substantial changes in promiscuous activity. Similar changes in promiscuous activities were found by Bloom et al. 39 with P450 BM3 neutral variants.\n\nIt is generally thought that the earliest forms of enzymes had broad substrate specificity or reaction ambiguity and subsequently diverged and became more reaction-specific to give today's modern enzymes. Such enzyme superfamilies are exemplified by the enola"

The aim of this case study is to highlight some of the key strategies involved in an enzyme evolution program and also to present an analysis of the learning process. We set out to develop a platform biocatalytic technology for the preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines, which are an important class of chiral building block, particularly for the synthesis of biologically active pharmaceutical drugs (Fig. 4). Despite their importance, relatively few biocatalytic methods have been developed for their preparation, and existing methods rely principally on either the kinetic resolution of racemates using hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases and acylases or the more recent development of the use of transaminases for the conversion of ketones to chiral amines (Fig. 5). A conceptually different approach to preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines relies on deracemization of a racemic starting amine to provide either enantiomer in high optical purity. The deracemization process requires the combination of an enantioselective amine oxidase enzyme (conversion of amine to imine) together with a nonselective chemical reducing agent (reduction of imine to amine). Repeated cycles of enantioselective oxidation coupled with nonselective reduction result in accumulation of either the (R)-or (S)-amine enantiomer, depending on the stereopreference of the oxidase enzyme.\n\nPrior"

The protein crystallized with a molecule of the inhibitor L-proline at the active site, thus allowing the position of the amine substrates to be estimated. Figure 6 shows the structure with four of the five key mutations found in the D5 variant mapped onto the sequence, and it is clear that these mutations are clustered close to the active site of the protein. Examination of the structure in more detail reveals the presence of two channels, labeled A and B, that pass from the surface of the protein and that intersect at the active site. The mutations at positions 336, 384 and 385 are located within channel A on loops, r e v i e w whereas the mutation at position 246 is located within channel B.

The chiral 1,3-diol-containing side chain of the cholesterol-lowering statin drugs (for example, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) has been a major target for biocatalysis, thus leading to the development of a number of different industrial processes that use one or more biocatalysts in the key step.

Both carbon-carbon bonds are formed with very high levels of enantioand diastereoselectivity (Fig. 3).

Two parallel developments are apparent in industry: chemical industries are hiring increasing numbers of life scientists, and organic chemists are beginning to embrace biocatalysis as a tool in new and difficult syntheses. This will lead to more industrial applications of biocatalysts.\n\nWork during the past decade has shown that there are surprisingly few barriers to the use of enzymes and whole cells as biocatalysts in organic synthesis 1,2 . Isolated enzymes are typically used for hydrolytic or isomerization reactions. Whole cells are often used for synthetic reactions that require cofactors which must be regenerated, because although cofactor regeneration in vitro is possible, it is generally easier and less expensive to regenerate cofactors in metabolically active cells. Both isolated enzymes and whole cells are used in industry today, and are an active area of research.\n\nEnzymes are remarkable catalysts: capable of accepting a wide array of complex molecules as substrates, and exquisitely selective, catalysing reactions with unparalleled chiral (enantio-) and positional (regio-) selectivities.

The starting point will usually be a product, which can perhaps be produced by one of several possible biocatalytic reactions that convert suitable substrates to the desired product. Figure 1 illustrates the development of such biocatalytic processes. One or more biocatalysts must be identified or developed, a process must be set up, and the resulting bioconversion will ultimately have to be economically feasible. The development of such a process requires the input of many different specialists. Limiting aspects of the biocatalytic process are improved in an iterative manner, gradually leading to an efficient industrial process. In setting priorities for improvements at each process step, a detailed understanding of the costs and improvement potential of each of the partial steps in a process is vital.\n\nThe economic feasibility of a biocatalytic process depends on several factors (Fig. 1).

Understanding the catalytic cycle of lipases has been of significant importance to their widespread use in different biotechnological applications. The lipase active site is composed of three different residues: serine, histidine and aspartate or glutamate.\n\nThe hydrolysis of an ester involves an acyl enzyme complex.

The 6-APA core structure can be extended by chemical means or by the action of an enzyme to a core structure suitable for synthesis of semisynthetic cephalosporins, such as 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA; 8 in Fig. 6c).

Both the biochemistry and genetics of the xylene degradative pathway have been studied extensively. p-Xylene (12 in Fig. 7e) is oxidized by xylene monooxygenase to 4-methylbenzylalcohol and further oxidized by other enzymes to the aldehyde (13) and 4-methylbenzoic acid (14).

This required 800 or 2,000 m 3 of bioreactor volume (continuous and batch processes respectively), as well as a processing unit for phase separation, distillation of substrate and product from the carrier solvent, and final separation of product from substrate (also by distillation). The estimated cost distribution was as follows: equipment depreciation and maintenance, 18-22%; substrates and solvents, 20%; energy, 10%; waste handling, 5%; personnel, 2%.

Applying sitedirected protein engineering, the community expected to design enzymes with predictable properties (this expectation turned out to be way premature). Even then, site saturation was part of the repertoire, which intellectually can already be attributed to 2. combinatorial protein engineering, the second wave and often also called directed evolution, with its peak between around 1995-2005. Two techniques dominate combinatorial protein design, random mutagenesis and recombination. Random mutagenesis most often operates with a high error rate of DNA duplication and thus introduces mistakes that lead to mutations anywhere in the gene sequence. Recombination digests the DNA into small pieces that are recombined in random fashion; appropriately, its most important protocol is called DNA shuffling. Combinatorial protein engineering is able to access a vastly wider sequence space than rational design but requires increasingly large libraries of mutants, with still low and uncertain chances of a successful outcome, owing to the vast sequence space of proteins.

Ninety-six-well plates specially adapted for oxygen pressure revealed successful conversion of a broad range of aromatic alkenes to the respective aldehydes or ketones, with excellent chemoselectivity, i.e., no overreaction to carboxylic acids (Figure 7). Not only were various substituted styrenes cleaved but also cyclic alkenes, such as indene or 1,2dihydronaphthalene (69). Mechanic investigations reveal that the new biocatalyst follows neither the standard dioxygenase nor the monooxygenase mechanism. It instead seems to prefer a mechanism akin to a 2 + 2 cycloaddition, as two oxygen atoms derived from two different molecules of dioxygen are incorporated into the carbonyl products (Figure 8) (70).

Altogether, variants labeled D1 through D11 are available from 11 generations of protein engineering, including both rational design and high-throughput screening of random mutations.

In the past, three points have often been raised to question the overall role of biocatalysis in catalytic processing: the lack of designability of biocatalysts, their limits of stability, and the insufficient number of well-characterized, readyto-use biocatalysts.\n\nProgress on all three fronts, outlined in the preceding section of this review, is very encouraging.\n\n1. Novel protein engineering tools have significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development (see above for descriptions of experimental and computational tools). 2. The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses, far more so than other kinds of catalysts, can be described quantitatively via rational models. Although protein stabilization commonly occurs in an incremental fashion as a function of amino acid sequence, there are now several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. Last but not least, the concept that stabilization against one type of stress, often thermoinstability, commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress, such as organic solvents, air-water or solid-water interfaces, or cavitation as a consequence of pumping or ultrasonication, is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. 3.

The microtiter plate format (96-and 384-well) currently dominates screening assays and will likely continue to do so for some time. The reasons for this are that microtiter plate readers are commonly available, microtiter plates offer unmatched flexibility in sample manipulation, a vast collection of protocols have been published, and it is easy to increase throughput by robotic automation. In practice, microtiter plate assays are limited to screening several tens of thousands of clones. This can be sufficient if single site-saturation or small combinatorial libraries have to be screened. 29,30 While these methods are still applicable to larger random and combinatorial libraries, they are not capable of screening a significant fraction of the library diversity. 31 One solution to this problem is to make the wells smaller, going through 1536-well plates to microcapillary arrays.

Since drug molecules mostly contain non-natural structures, the design of their biosynthetic pathways has more challenges in comparison to natural products. An effective strategy is to introduce artificially designed enzymatic cascades on the basis of related natural synthetic pathways, which can reduce the complexity of pathway design. Moreover, de novo biosynthetic pathways require screening of novel enzymes or modification of existing enzymes through protein engineering to obtain biocatalysts with sufficient activity, specificity, and stability that meet the requirements of drug synthesis. Furthermore, some auxiliary enzymatic cascades are also designed to optimise the supply of cofactors and reduce the formation of by-products in the synthetic pathway.

Since in the salvage pathway the enzymatic reactions catalysed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), phosphopentomutase (PPM) and deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) are all reversible, the retrosynthetic route thus formed is feasible in terms of reaction kinetics and more efficient than the natural synthetic route of nucleotides.

IkaA catalyses the formation of tetramic acid from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and L-ornithine via an unusual iterative PKS/NRPS mechanism. IkaB and IkaC are reductases catalyzing the cyclisation of tetramic acid via the formation of the outer and inner bonds of the carbocycle, respectively.

The most applied class of enzymes are the hydrolases. Almost 50% of all enzyme applications concern hydrolysis or synthesis of esters or amides, but also nitriles. As the majority of the enzyme catalysed reactions are performed in water, hydrolase catalysed reactions are a straightforward starting point, with the obvious advantage that the solvent is a reagent. Since it is always in huge excess the equilibrium of the reaction automatically is on the hydrolysis side. This chemistry is today fully developed; as is the application of hydrolases in dry solvent to revert the equilibrium to prepare esters or amides. Even for nitriles viable routes have been developed, as highlighted below (Scheme 28).

The second and third waves ensured that today biocatalysis is based on an understanding of the enzymes, including their scaffolds, which allows rapid identification of countless variations of a specific enzymatic activity, making a catalyst available for essentially all substrates with the functional group the synthetic chemist wishes to modify. More importantly, new reactions can be catalysed that were beforehand considered outside the scope of enzymes. This, in combination with an improved understanding of kinetics and thermodynamics governing the reactions, today allow the fast, efficient and clean synthesis of very complex structures under very mild conditions.\n\nNew types of biocatalytic reactions remain to be unravelled with already known or soon to be discovered enzymes that would allow access to further classes of molecules.

[1] In fact, enzymes quite often display high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity, which makes these catalysts especially attractive for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical areas, where the interest for enantiomerically pure and specifically functionalized compounds is continuously growing. Furthermore, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are normally carried out under mild conditions, such as room temperature and neutral or almost neutral pH, which minimizes problems of product isomerization, racemization, or epimerization. In addition, enzymes can be very efficient catalysts, capable of increasing reaction rates by up to 10 12 times. Finally, biocatalytic processes are less hazardous, polluting, and energy consuming than conventional chemistry-based methodologies, especially those making use of heavy-metal catalysts.\n\nAll these reasons have made biocatalysis a popular topic for research in academia and industry and a tremendous number of enzymes have been described in the literature with a claimed potential for practical exploitation. For instance, the database BioCatalysis, based on 8000 articles and patents, describes 18 500 biotransformations carried out with enzymes, microorganisms, and catalytic antibodies.

[9] found that there was a direct correlation between activity and solvent hydrophobicity, expressed as log P (where P is the partition coefficient of a given solvent between n-octanol and water). The authors ascribed this result to differences in the ability of organic solvents to distort the essential water layer around the biocatalysts. [9] Shortly afterwards, Zaks and Klibanov [10] demonstrated, with the three unrelated enzymes yeast alcohol oxidase, mushroom polyphenol oxidase, and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, that enzyme activity was more or less coincident in the various solvents, provided that the amount of water bound to the enzyme was the same. Figure 2 a shows that the more hydrophilic the solvent is, the higher the water content of the solvent has to be to reach high activity. This happens because the water content of the enzyme (W e , Figure 2 b) and not that of the solvent (W S , Figure 2 a) is what actually matters for activity. Thus, depending on the hydrophobicity of the solvent, the same water content results in entirely different amounts of water on the enzyme. These data suggest that the effects of organic solvents on an enzyme are primarily due to interactions with the essential enzyme-bound layer of water rather than with the enzyme itself.

The identity of the mechanism of subtilisin-catalyzed ester hydrolysis in water and transesterification in organic solvents has been demonstrated by Chatterjee and Russel,[24d,e] who have also determined individual rate constants and equilibrium constants of the reaction in organic solvents.\n\nConsidering kinetic parameters in organic solvents, the values may be very different from solvent to solvent and from those for the same enzyme and substrate in aqueous media; similarly, substrate specificity may change dramatically from solvent to solvent and from water. Table 2, for example, shows that N-acetyl-l-serine ethyl ester (N-Ac-l-Ser-OEt) is the preferred substrate of subtilisin in dichloromethane, while in tert-butylamine the preferred substrate is N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine ethyl ester (N-Ac-l-Phe-OEt).

However, while protonation in water is simply controlled by adjustments of pH values, this is not the case in organic solvents, where even the concept of pH value itself is challenged. [14c] A way to control the initial state of enzyme protonation and, hence, activity was developed by Zaks and Klibanov,[24a] who showed that enzyme activity in organic solvents was markedly dependent on the pH value of the solution from which the enzyme was recovered (by lyophilization or precipitation). This methodology, which is now widely applied in the field of biocatalysis in organic solvents, is perfectly suitable when there is no alteration of acid/base concentration in the course of the reaction. If this is not the case, as in the synthesis, hydrolysis, or aminolysis of esters, for instance, the enzyme protonation and activity may change during reaction.\n\nTo overcome this drawback, the use of buffering systems involving highly hydrophobic acids and their sodium salts, and highly hydrophobic bases and their hydrochlorides, has been proposed. [27] Indeed, these systems can efficiently buffer organic solvent media, as illustrated in Figure 4 where the dependence of subtilisin activity on the composition of some acids pairs and their conjugated bases is shown.

This simplifies catalyst ± product separation and enzyme reutilization.\n\nThe simplest way to prepare biocatalysts for use in organic solvents and, at the same time, to adjust key parameters such as pH value and associated ions, is enzyme lyophilization or precipitation (by, for instance, addition of acetone) from aqueous solutions.

For instance, the solvent, depending on its polarity, could modify the enzyme conformation and, thus, influence the selectivity by altering the molecular recognition process between substrate and enzyme. [54a] According to another theory, selectivity depends on the energetics of substrate solvation, [54b] whereas a third model envisages that solvent molecules could bind within the active site and, depending on their structure, interfere with the association or transformation of one enantiomer more than with that of the other.

          "text": "Every enzyme has a characteristic three-dimensional structure. This structure, which is a prerequisite for activity, is maintained by disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonding (including water networks), and hydrophobic interaction. This latter effect is not really an interaction, apart from some slight Van der Waals contribution, but rather is the entropy-driven exclusion of hydrophobic groups from contact with water, which causes these to be buried in the protein structure. Even under physiological conditions, the stability margin of dissolved proteins is only a precarious 20-60 kJ mol -1 . 57 Unfolding requires the dissociation of many hydrogen bonds at the same time and brings the buried hydrophobic groups into contact with the solvent. Consequently, proteins are destabilized by compounds that interact specifically with the unfolded protein. It is widely accepted, on the basis of deactivation kinetics, that unfolding proceeds through two stages: a reversible first stage, followed by a slower, irreversible step.\n\nWater, the natural medium of enzyme catalysis, interacts sufficiently strongly to dissolve enzymes, but not strong enough to dissociate the structural hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that enzyme solutions in pure water are often unstable, which is why they are commonly kept in phosphate or citrate buffers. This latter stabilizing effect can be ascribed to \"salting out\" of hydrophobic groups, which increases the energy barrier to unfolding and exposure of such groups."

This latter characteristic is at the basis of the successful application of such hydrolases in nonhydrolytic reactions, such as the (enantioselective) acylation of alcohols and amines, which now are major industrial applications. 65 Interference of organic media, including ionic liquids, with enzyme activity is often discussed in terms of removal of essential water. Many enzymes indeed require a full hydration shell to be active, but there are numerous exceptions, such as CaLB, which maintains its activity upon drying over phosphorus pentoxide, 66 and the protease subtilisin, which requires only a few tightly bound water molecules per molecule of enzyme to be active. 67 It is now commonly accepted that water requirements should be discussed in terms of the thermodynamic water activity a w rather than water concentration. 64 It should be noted that performing nonhydrolytic reactions with lipases or proteases in the presence of small amounts of water, to maintain or improve the activity, will nearly always give rise to hydrolytic side reactions.

Storage stability is measured by incubation in, for example, an ionic liquid, at a certain temperature, by monitoring the residual activity in samples after dilution with water.

It should be kept in mind, however, that the hydrophobic effect, which significantly contributes to protein stabilization, does not exist in organic solvents.

There is hardly an ionic liquid that is not tolerated by any enzyme, and the impression is that ionic liquids are generally tolerated to higher concentrations than water-miscible molecular solvents.\n\nMany hydrolases, particularly those that tolerate conventional organic solvents, are eminently capable of performing nonhydrolytic reactions in ionic liquids. Activities are generally comparable with or higher than those observed in conventional organic solvents. Furthermore, enhanced thermal and operational stabilities and regio-or enantioselectivities have been observed in many cases. Enzyme-compatible ionic liquids generally do not interact strongly with the enzyme or cause the latter to dissolve. A notable exception to this latter rule is an ionic liquid that passed the ultimate enzyme compatibility test by dissolving enzymes while their activity is maintained. There is, as yet, no theoretical basis for predicting the compatibility of ionic liquids, aqueous or anhydrous, and enzymes, but we expect that the intensity of the interest in the subject will cause one to be developed soon.\n\nIonic liquids have obvious potential as reaction media for biotransformations of highly polar substrates, such as (poly)saccharides, which cannot be performed in water, owing to equilibrium limitations.

Moreover, the immobilized enzyme molecules will not be in contact with any external hydrophobic interface, such as air bubbles originated by supplying some required gases or promoted by strong stirring, necessary to control pH. These gas bubbles may produce enzyme inactivation of soluble proteins [19][20][21][22], but cannot inactivate the enzymes immobilized on a porous solid [23,24] (Fig. 1).\n\nIn the presence of an organic solvent phase, the immobilized enzymes may be in contact with the molecules of solvent which are soluble in the aqueous phase, but not with the organic phaseinterface, preventing this inactivation cause again.\n\nThus, any immobilization protocol of an enzyme which yields the enzyme immobilized inside a porous solid as the final product may permit an \"operational stabilization\" of the enzyme, even without really affecting the structural stability of the enzyme, simply by the mechanisms described above.\n\nHowever, this stabilization is not universally associated to the immobilization.

Now, the relative distances among all residues involved in the multipoint immobilization have to be maintained unaltered during any conformational change induced by any distorting agent (heat, organic solvents, extreme pH values). This should reduce any conformational change involved in enzyme inactivation and greatly increase the enzyme stability.\n\nHowever, to achieve these intense multipoint covalent attachments between the enzyme and the support -two dissimilar and rigid structures -is not a trivial problem. It becomes necessary to choose suitable immobilization systems to take advantages of the prospects of these techniques. Some authors had even discarded the possibility of getting a significant stabilization by this technique, due to the only moderate geometric congruence between the enzyme and the support [11,13,14].\n\nThus, the characteristics of the support, reactive groups and immobilization conditions need to be carefully selected to be able to involve the maximum number of enzyme groups in the immobilization.

Although immobilization may be very rapid, multipoint interaction between the non-complementary enzyme and support surfaces is a slow and time-dependent process: it requires the correct alignment of groups located in the already immobilized, and partially rigidified enzyme, and the rigid surface of the support. • pH value. Although immobilization may be performed at neutral pH value in many cases, incubation at alkaline pH values, where the reactivity of the nucleophiles of the protein (usually Lys) may be improved, is convenient to reach a high enzyme-support reaction. It should be kept in mind that while terminal amino groups may have a pK between 7 and 8, exposed Lys groups will present a pK over 10.5. • Temperature. Moderately high temperature may favor the vibration of enzyme and support, increasing the possibilities of getting more enzyme-support linkages. • Buffers.

However, if properly designed, results achieved via immobilization techniques may be really impressive, perfectly comparable to any other stabilization technique. For example, Table 1 shows some of the results obtained after immobilizing many different proteins on glyoxyl agarose under optimal conditions (see Refs. [23,24,29,30,33,). The stabilization factors are in many cases extremely high (1000-10,000-fold factors) with activity recoveries usually over 60%.\n\nThe use of epoxy-activated supports also may give very good results, perhaps lower that glyoxyl agarose but still very significant (see Table 2) [31,[71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86].

The inactivation of these enzymes starts, in many instances, by the dissociation of the enzyme in its individual subunits [87]. Even if this is not relevant for enzyme stability, the release of enzyme subunits may contaminate the final product (e.g., a food). Stabilization of multimeric enzymes by genetic engineering may be too complex, leaving the immobilization or the chemical modification as the simplest strategies to solve the dissociation problem of oligomeric proteins. However, in this case the immobilization-stabilization strategy should consider this multimeric nature of the enzyme, pursuing not only the multipoint attachment of the protein, but also the multisubunit attachment. The ideas behind will be very similar to the previously described for the multipoint covalent attachment. Thus, the multimeric structure of dimeric enzymes may be easily stabilized by immobilization on highly activated supports [88].\n\nSome successful examples of this strategy obtained in our laboratory are: d-amino acid oxidases from Trigonopsis variabilis and Rodotorula gracilis [35,51], formate dehydrogenases from Pseudomas sp. and Candida boidini [24,70], alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver [68] (Fig. 3).

However, in some cases, the enzyme may have two forms with very different activity, and if we were able to fix the enzyme form with higher activity, the final immobilized preparation may be more active than the native one. One of the clearest examples of this is the case of lipases. Lipases show two different conformations. The closed form, considered inactive, where the active site is isolated from the reaction medium by a polypeptide chain called lid, and the open form, where this lid is displaced and the active site is fully exposed to the reaction medium [95][96][97][98]. Both forms of lipases are in an equilibrium affected by the experimental conditions. In the presence of hydrophobic drops of substrate, lipases may become strongly adsorbed on the interface of these drops and the conformational equilibrium is shifted towards the open form of the lipases.\n\nFrom these features, two strategies to get immobilized lipases molecules with an improved activity have been developed, both trying to fix the open form of the lipase."

Unfortunately, the lack of chemical stabilization of these aggregates made them only useful in organic medium, being re-dissolved in aqueous medium. Recently, Sheldon and co-workers showed that the preparation of CLEAs of lipases in the presence of detergents may permit to get improved lipase activity, very likely by fixing the open form of lipases during crosslinking [105]. These CLEAs, chemically crosslinked, could be already used in any reaction media without risking re-dissolution.\n\nRecently, the stabilization of the open forms of lipases adsorbed on aminated supports has been shown. To this goal, immobilized lipases from different source were incubated in the presence of detergents and then, the crosslinking with glutaraldehyde of the amino groups placed in the support and in the enzyme was attempted. Results suggested that this is a good option to get lipases exhibiting a higher catalytic activity [106] (Fig. 6).

Among the many tools to improve the enzyme selectivity (e.g., protein engineering or directed evolution [107][108][109][110]), again it is possible to find the protein immobilization as a powerful technique.\n\nImmobilization of a protein may produce some distortion on the active site, reducing the overall mobility of the protein groups. Moreover, enzymes that suffer great conformational changes during catalysis could have these changes distorted when immobilized, producing immobilized enzymes with fully altered catalytic properties.

Ionic binding is generally stronger and covalent binding of the enzyme to the support would generally prevent the enzyme from leaching from the surface.

The three terms most often used to determine the success of enzyme immobilisation are the immobilisation yield, the immobilisation efficiency and the activity recovery. The immobilisation yield should be used to describe the percentage of total enzyme activity from the free enzyme solution that is immobilised: Yield (%) = 100 Â (immobilised activity/starting activity)\n\nThe ''activity that is immobilised'' can only be correctly determined by measuring the total residual enzyme activity that remains in the enzyme solution after immobilisation and by subtracting this activity from the total starting activity. In some cases a parallel blank experiment should be carried out to compensate for free enzyme deactivation under the immobilisation conditions. Sometimes protein measurements are used to determine the immobilisation yield. This could be misleading, especially when a crude protein mixture is used for immobilisation, as the different proteins can have different immobilisation yields. It can however be useful to monitor both enzyme activity and protein concentration in the supernatant, to rule out any deactivation of the free enzyme and to determine the protein and/or enzyme loading (wt%) of the immobilised biocatalyst.\n\nThe second term often used to describe the success of immobilisation is the immobilisation efficiency.

A disadvantage of immobilisation in this way is that, because it is not covalently bound, the enzyme can be leached from the support in an aqueous medium or in the presence of substrates and/or products with surfactant-like properties.\n\nIn order to suppress leaching, covalent attachment to surface-functionalised acrylic resins, such as Eupergit s C, a macroporous copolymer of N,N 0 -methylene-bi-(methacrylamide), glycidyl methacrylate, allyl glycidyl ether and methacrylamide, is widely used for immobilisation of enzymes. 16 Eupergit C is highly hydrophilic and stable, both chemically and mechanically, over a pH-range from 0 to 14, and does not swell or shrink even upon drastic pH changes in this range.

One of the simplest and most inexpensive methods to immobilise an enzyme is by silica granulation. 15 It is used in detergent formulations which release the enzyme into the washing liquid during washing. Granulation technology was used to immobilise CaLB lipase on silica granules, by first adsorbing the lipase on silica powder followed by agglomeration. 15 Granulates are only suitable for use in organic media. In an aqueous medium the lipase is desorbed and the particle slowly disintegrates. However, the CaLB silica granules can be used in a direct ester synthesis if the water is removed by e.g. evaporation under vacuum. Applying the granules in packed bed reactors also minimises the contact time with high water concentrations. The CaLB silica granules exhibited a similar activity to Novozyme 435 in the direct synthesis of the skin emollient, isopropyl myristate. In order to maintain stability in an aqueous environment the enzyme needs to be covalently attached to a functionalised silica support.\n\nMesoporous silicas, nowadays often referred to as nanosilicas, have several advantages as supports. They have uniform pore diameters (2-40 nm), very high surface areas (300-1500 m 2 g À1 ) and pore volumes (ca. 1 ml g À1 ), and are inert and stable at elevated temperatures.

PCMCs are prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of the enzyme with a concentrated solution of a salt such as potassium sulphate, an amino acid or a sugar. The resulting solution is added dropwise with vigorous mixing to a water-miscible solvent such as isopropanol, whereupon micron-sized crystals, containing the enzyme on the surface, are formed. A major advantage of the technique is that the enzyme molecules are dehydrated by a mechanism that leaves the majority of the enzymes in an active conformation and minimises denaturation. The PCMCs can be separated and stored or used as a suspension in an organic solvent. Obviously in an aqueous medium they dissolve to liberate the free enzyme. In a transesterification of N-acetyl tyrosine ethyl ester with isopropanol (Fig. 4) PCMCs of subtilisin Carlsberg (EC 3.4.21.62) exhibited an activity three orders of magnitude higher than that of the lyophilised powder. 28 Fig. 3 Tanabe aminoacylase process using a packed bed of biocatalyst.

          "text": "A novel approach to immobilisation of enzymes is via covalent attachment to stimulus-responsive or 'smart polymers' which undergo dramatic conformational changes in response to small changes in their environment, e.g. temperature, pH and ionic strength. 29 The most well-known example is the thermoresponsive and biocompatible polymer, poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (polyNIPAM). Aqueous solutions of polyNIPAM exhibit a critical solution temperature (LCST) around 32 1C, below which the polymer readily dissolves in water while, above the LCST it becomes insoluble owing to expulsion of water molecules from the polymer network. Hence, the biotransformation can be performed under conditions where the enzyme is soluble, thereby minimising diffusional limitations and loss of activity owing to protein conformational changes on the surface of a support. Subsequently, raising the temperature above the LCST leads to precipitation of the immobilised enzyme, thus facilitating its recovery and reuse. An additional advantage is that runaway conditions are avoided because when the reaction temperature exceeds the LCST the catalyst precipitates and the reaction shuts down.\n\nTwo methods are generally used to prepare the enzyme-polyNIPAM conjugates: (i) introduction of polymerisable vinyl groups into the enzyme followed by copolymerisation with NIPAM or (ii) reaction of NH 2 groups on the surface of the enzyme with a copolymer of NIPAM containing reactive ester groups (Fig. 5) or the homopolymer cont"

For good filterability the particles should be relatively large but increasing the particle size can result in loss of activity owing to diffusion limitations, i.e. slow diffusion of the substrate through the large particles. This means that in practice a compromise has to be made where the particles are large enough to facilitate filtration or centrifugation but not too large that diffusion limitations become an issue. This is even more so in the production of larger volume products where processes are often conducted in continuous operation over a packed bed of (bio)catalyst. In this case it is important to have relatively large particles in order to avoid a pressure drop over the column. Here again, a compromise has to be struck to avoid the pressure drop without decreasing activity as a result of diffusion limitations. In contrast, very small (micron-or even nano-size) particles can be successfully used in a so-called fluidised bed, whereby the liquid feed is passed through the bed of solid catalyst at high enough velocities to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid.

When alkyl siloxanes, RSi(OR) 3 are used together with Si(OR) 4 the surface of the sol-gel is more densely populated by the hydrophobic alkyl groups and the capillary stresses which operate during evaporation are largely attenuated, affording a so-called ambigel in which there is no contraction of the nano cages. Alternatively, drying with supercritical carbon dioxide affords so-called aerogels in which the delicate pore structure and accompanying high porosity is maintained.\n\nEntrapment of lipases in sol-gels derived from Si(OEt) 4 afforded immobilisates with disappointingly low activities in the esterification of lauric acid by 1-octanol. 33 In contrast, entrapment in a sol-gel prepared from a mixture of Si(OMe) 4 and RSi(OMe) 3 afforded a more hydrophobic matrix exhibiting rate enhancements of 2-8 fold compared with the corresponding lyophilised powder.

In principle free enzymes can also be entrapped in Lentikats by mixing them directly with the liquid precursor of the Lentikat. Unfortunately the dimensions of most enzymes are not large enough to prevent them leaching from the hydrogel network in an aqueous environment. In order to prevent this the reaction should be performed in non-aqueous media or the size of the enzyme should be increased, e.g. by cross-linking. For example, Gro ¨ger and coworkers 40 entrapped an (R)-hydroxynitrile lyase in a Lentikat PVA hydrogel by crosslinking it using a mixture of glutaraldehyde and chitosan (Fig. 7).

However, this methodology had several drawbacks: low activity retention, poor reproducibility, low mechanical stability, and difficulties in handling the gelatinous CLEs. Mechanical stability and ease of handling could be improved by cross-linking the enzyme in a gel matrix or on a carrier but this led to a disadvantageous dilution of activity. Consequently, in the late 1960s, emphasis switched to carrier-bound enzymes, which became the most widely used methodology for enzyme immobilisation for the following three decades."

Their operational stability and ease of recycling, coupled with their high catalyst and volumetric productivities, renders them ideally suited for industrial biotransformations.

The addition of salts, or water miscible organic solvents or non-ionic polymers, to aqueous solutions of proteins leads to their precipitation as physical aggregates of protein molecules, held together by non-covalent bonding without perturbation of their tertiary structure, that is without denaturation. Subsequent cross-linking of these physical aggregates renders them permanently insoluble while maintaining their pre-organised superstructure, and, hence their catalytic activity. This led to the development of a new technology for immobilising enzymes as so-called cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA s ) (Fig. 8). Since precipitation from an aqueous medium, by addition of ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol, is often used to purify enzymes, the CLEA methodology essentially combines purification and immobilisation into a single unit operation that does not require a highly pure enzyme. It can be used, for example, for the direct immobilisation of an enzyme from a crude fermentation broth.\n\nThe CLEA can be modified by performing the cross-linking in the presence of a monomer that undergoes (co)polymerisation under these conditions. This affords CLEA-polymer composites with tunable physical properties. For example, if the cross-linking is performed in the presence of a siloxane, e.g. Si(OMe) 4 or RSi(OMe) 3 , the latter undergoes simultaneous polymerisation to afford a CLEA-silica composite. 13 "

Furthermore, by coupling steps together unfavourable equilibria can be driven towards product. In principle, this can be achieved by co-precipitation and cross-linking of two or more enzymes in 'combi CLEAs'.

Immobilisation as silica granulates, for example, meets all these criteria but the methodology is not compatible with aqueous environments (see earlier). Cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) would appear to have considerable industrial potential based on their high activity retention and stability coupled with ease of preparation from crude enzyme samples and no requirement for a support. Because they consist mainly of active catalyst they also display high catalyst productivities and space time yields. It is also clear that every enzyme is different and, consequently, there is no all-encompassing, 'one size fits all' solution to enzyme immobilisation. Driven by the industrial and societal need for sustainable chemical products and processes, and the attractive features of biocatalysis in this context, we expect that interest in improving the operational performance of enzymes by effective immobilisation will continue unabated in the future."

The Coflore ACR is a dynamically mixed plug flow reactor that uses moving agitators to promote mixing (Fig. 47B), while the Coflore ATR is a tubeshaped reactor using lateral movement (like twisting a spring in a horizontal direction) for improved mass transfer in two-phase reactions (Fig. 47C).

Chemicals typically move in a mono-directional flow with limited reverse diffusion back down the reactor. Thus, once a sacrificial reductant such as a hydride transfer reagent is used, it can only be regenerated via interaction with chemicals in that individual flow segment or the surface of the continuous flow reactor. In contrast, sacrificial reductants or hydride transfer reagents in batch reactors can be regenerated easily as there is multi-directional diffusion. This next section examines current state-of-the-art continuous flow co-factor regeneration methods.\n\nCo-factors are low molecular weight organic or inorganic compounds required for enzyme function (Fig. 52). Metal co-factors include iron, magnesium, and zinc, which can play both structural and catalytic roles. The most popular co-factor examined in this Review is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which can exist either in an oxidized or reduced state, NAD + and NADH respectively. Enzymes use co-factors as reagents and co-catalysts during complex chemical transformations. For example, NADH can provide a hydride source during bioreduction.

Although continuous flow organic synthesis has enjoyed significant popularity, continuous flow biocatalysis is not far behind.

Many examples detail the range of enhancements continuous flow can bring to enzyme-mediated transformations. These include improved reaction rates, in-line product removal and purification, better mixing, improved control, use of process analytical technology, and improved enzyme stability and lifetime. It is remarkable that improved performances of up to 351-fold were observed in continuous flow, and that is without any directed evolution of the enzyme; it is worth considering the improvements possible by combining directed evolution and continuous flow.

Consequently, the cascade approach can lead to higher yields compared to a classical sequence of single-step transformations while at the same time increasing the synthetic efficiency by saving operational workup steps and resources. Additionally, cascades may help to reduce the amount of waste, since less chemicals (e.g., by circumventing work up) are used.\n\nCascades may be ideal to avoid the need for applying toxic compounds as initial substrate, since these reagents might be generated in situ and consumed as soon as formed.\n\nCombining catalysts and reagents in a single pot and performing reactions simultaneously require all reaction conditions to be compatible with each other, which could be challenging, for instance, in case the pH range of the individual catalysts does not overlap; also, the temperature needs to be considered, since multiple enzymes in a cascade may have different optimum operational temperatures, especially if thermophilic enzymes are employed. In case a cosolvent is required to improve the solubility of the substrate in the aqueous phase, all enzymes must tolerate the solvent.\n\nFurthermore, the overall reaction cascade must be energetically favored. 17 If this"

Comparing the simultaneous cascade with the cascade performed in sequential mode (adding the ADH after completion of the BAL reaction), the latter gave better results concerning conversion (93% vs 75%) while ee and de were the same in both cases (>99% ee; 99.6% and 99.8% de, respectively). This was attributed mainly to the competing reduction of benzaldehyde by Ralstonia ADH that was observed in the simultaneous cascade, which led to the accumulation of benzyl alcohol (39 mM). Performing the two-step reaction on a preparative scale (1.06 g of benzaldehyde), the (1R,2R)-product was obtained with 58% isolated yield and excellent optical purity (>99% ee, 99% de).

As a consequence, the second reaction in the cascade replenishes the substrate of the first reaction, leading to the term \"recycling cascade\" for processes of this kind. 304 However, a simultaneous coupling of both biotransformation steps turned out to be problematic when the transaminase from C. violaceum was used, since this enzyme converted benzaldehyde more efficiently than (R)-PAC. The cascade process hence accumulated benzylamine as an undesired side product while forming norephedrine in only 2% conversion.

In a study on the cost contribution of biocatalyst production to biocatalytic processes, Tufvesson and co-workers found purified enzyme roughly 10-fold more expensive than whole cells [12]. Subsequent catalyst immobilization added even more costs to the analyzed process, with the carrier material being particularly impactful to the cost increase. Additionally, the scale in which whole cells are produced is decisive for the final catalyst price, meaning the bigger the scale the cheaper the catalyst (economy of scale). As soon as a sufficient market size for an aspired product is given, it is advisable to either invest into large scale production vessels or search for a contract manufacturer with appropriate facilities."

Consequently, especially reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases, depending on nicotinamide cofactors, are often performed in whole cells, while the cofactor is traditionally regenerated by conversion of a sacrificial cosubstrate or by regeneration in an enzyme-coupled approach [13 ]. Despite advances in the fields of electrochemical or photochemical regeneration methods [13 ], the coupling of enzymatic reactions in redox-neutral multi-step reactions found great interest recently. Here, monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed processes are frequently combined [14,15,16 ]. Of course, such approaches rely on proper balancing of reaction rates of both enzymatic reactions and on the effectiveness and efficiency of such a route to access the product of interest. Another novel strategy is the use of 'smart' diol cosubstrates (Figure 1) [17]. After double oxidation of the diol, a stable lactone ring is formed, which drives the thermodynamic equilibrium to the product side. Because of this shift and the supply of two reduction equivalents per molecule of cosubstrate, 90 mol% of cosubstrate are saved in comparison to traditional alcohol cosubstrates, which usually require at least a five-fold molar excess.

As an example, the benefits of a micro-aqueous solvent system were demonstrated for the biocatalytic synthesis of cyanohydrins using recombinant E. coli cells containing Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL). Since product formation also proceeds non-catalytically in the presence of water, only the application in micro-aqueous methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) enabled the hydrocyanation in a stereoselective manner (ee > 98% for (R)-mandelonitrile) [30].

Therefore, in some cases it can be beneficial to express each enzyme in single and later combine the cells into cascade reactions flexibly [27]. Anyhow, cascade biocatalysis becomes particularly sophisticated yet appealing when redox-neutral (see Section 'Cofactor regeneration') or recycling cascades [47] are designed.

A recent in depth characterization of Lentikat particles unveiled a pronounced physical strength of the lenses [51], making them well suited for stirred tank reactor setups. Of further importance, Lentikats including E. coli whole cell catalyst were proven storable for up to 15 month [52], enable almost identical reaction rates as free cells, and maintain their catalytic activity much better than freely suspended catalyst [53]. Another stabilizing technology is the silicone coating of recombinant E. coli adhesively grown on ion exchange resin.

A classical way to decrease this negative effect is the deliberate permeabilization of the cell wall compounds by treatment with surfactants, chelating agents, or organic solvent (Figure 2a) [11,62]. An alternative to enhance mass transfer is the coexpression of membrane transporters as recently shown for the biocatalytic conversion of C7 to C16 alkanes (Figure 2b). Coexpression of the alkL gene from Pseudomonas putida enhanced the cell specific product yield up to 100-fold, due to an increased substrate uptake [63 ]. Many more such examples of influx as well as efflux transporters potentially useful for biocatalysis have been summarized recently by Kell et al. [64]. Instead of enhancing the transfer of substrate towards the enzyme, others employed cell surface display techniques to rather bring the enzyme to the substrate (Figure 2c). As an example, Candida antarctica lipase B was displayed on Pichia pastoris, with the additional result of increased solvent and thermal stability [65].

Metabolic engineering of the chassis is also necessary and may involve, among other approaches, increasing the cell's uptake of substrates, reducing substrate and product degradation and enhancing product transport [2,11,46]."

          "text": "Expression of foreign pathways often results in suboptimal performance due to unintended factors such as introduction of toxic metabolites or poor expression of pathway components [45]. The identification of ratecontrolling steps is particularly important in pathway optimization. Once the bottleneck of the pathway is identified, its limiting power can be reduced by improving the expression of rate-controlling enzymes, substituting ratecontrolling enzymes with a higher activity from other species, and modifying the enzymes by protein engineering [16,45,47]. Enhancing the expression of the ratecontrolling enzyme is usually the easiest change to enact.\n\nA whole-cell biocatalyst for Neu5Ac production was developed by assembling a heterologous biosynthetic pathway in E. coli that consisted of AGE and NanA. NanA was identified to be the rate-controlling enzyme of the engineered pathway. Efforts had been made to alleviate the NanA bottleneck by manipulating the amount of the recombinant enzyme. When the expression of NanA increased, a nine-fold increase in Neu5Ac production was achieved [16]. For the biosynthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac), 7-O (or 9-O)-acetyltransferase (NeuD), CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (NeuA) and alpha-Neu5Ac alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (NeuS) were required [48]. Overexpressing the key enzyme NeuD resulted in a threefold increase in PSA production relative to that in the parent strain [15]."

Targeted modifications on the gene level can optimize expression levels through codon usage, promoter and RBS optimization, the use of alternative genes, and the use of enzymes from other species [45,49]. Maximizing the flux of a synthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in obtaining the best volumetric productivity of a bioconversion and thus lowering the production cost of the targeted chemicals.\n\nA very illustrative example of these approaches is the optimization of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway to enhance isoprenoid production. The strategies aimed to balance the pathways and eliminate the accumulation of toxic intermediates in addition to maximizing the flux towards the product. A mevalonate-based isopentenyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis pathway (MVA) was introduced into an E. coli strain to produce large quantities of isoprenoids [47,50,51]. The MVA pathway was introduced into E. coli in the form of two synthetic operons, an \"upper pathway\" that converted acetyl-CoA to MVA and a \"lower pathway\" that produced dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) from MVA, that were a combination of bacterial and yeast enzymes [49,52]. The upper pathway comprises two genes (MvaE and MvaS) from Enterococcus faecalis, while the lower pathway comprises the MVK, PMK, MVD, and IDI enzymes from Saccharomyc"

The removal of the nanA and nanT genes that encode the Neu5Ac aldolase and Neu5Ac transporter, respectively, abolished sialic acid catabolism, while knocking out the nanK (encoding the Neu5Ac transporter) and nanA genes prevented ManNAc and Neu5Ac from being diverted from the biosynthetic pathway [37,42]. When the nanTEK genes of engineered E. coli were knocked out, Neu5Ac production was enhanced threefold, resulting in 173.8 mM Neu5Ac [16]. The combination of blocking Neu5Ac uptake and preventing the diversion of ManNAc from the desired biosynthetic pathway pushed the two reversible reactions towards the synthesis of Neu5Ac, which synergistically resulted in the production of a large amount of Neu5Ac."

          "text": "In engineered strains, bioconversion efficiency is determined not only by metabolic flux but also by the efficient turnover of precursors [55]. When a heterologous pathway is introduced into a production host, the pathway will unavoidably compete with the native metabolism for common precursors. Consequently, elevating the levels of important precursors by redirecting the corresponding fluxes can be an efficient strategy to enhance production of target compounds.\n\nFor 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)dependent carotenoid biosynthesis, an imbalanced supply of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate precursors is one of the major metabolic bottlenecks, especially considering the limit of the G3P precursor's availability. Systematic modification of targets within central metabolic pathways was conducted to promote the redistribution of metabolic fluxes towards MEPdependent carotenoid biosynthesis. The flux to the EMP pathway was rewired towards the ED/PP pathways by knocking out phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Tweaking the flux at the branch point between ED and PP by overexpressing eda and fine-tuning gnd expression in a PGI-deficient strain (Δpgi) improved the G3P/Pyr supply and rebalanced precursor availability, which relieved the bottleneck. Further improvements in DXS expression led to efficient use of G3P and pyruvate in the MEP pathway and significantly increased productivity [55].

          "text": "A whole-cell biocatalyst is usually preferred for cofactor-dependent reactions since the inherent presence of cofactors that are generated by the host cell and the ease of their recycling greatly improve the economics of the process [2]. In cells, the cofactors, such as nicotinamide, 2-oxoglutarate, acetyl-CoA and ATP, are mainly used in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle and are present at low concentrations. Cofactor supply and regeneration may be limited if the target biosynthetic reaction is rapid. Therefore, metabolic engineering to increase cofactor supply and regeneration is necessary. Cofactor recycling is key not only to lowering the cost of a process but also to driving the reaction of interest to completion.\n\nIncreased cofactor regeneration is traditionally accomplished using an in situ regeneration reaction (Fig. 2a). For oxidoreductase-catalysed reactions that depend on nicotinamide cofactors, cofactor recycling in whole-cell biocatalysts is achieved by cascading the reaction with a dehydrogenase and thus coupling the recycling of the nicotinamide cofactor to the conversion of a sacrificial co-substrate by formate dehydrogenase, glucose dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, phosphite dehydrogenase or hydrogenase [56][57][58][59]. The dehydrogenases that are most commonly exploited for the recycling of NAD(P)H are formate dehydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase, which obtain reduction equivalents by enzymatically oxidizing the sacrificial substrates formate and "

Elimination of GlcNAc-specific PTS reduced GlcNAc-related side reactions and increased Neu5Ac production by 1.28-fold [39]. The outer membrane protein AlkL of P. putida GPo1 was reported to improve hydrophobic substrate uptake into E. coli [68]. E. coli cells overexpressing the monooxygenase system AlkBGT and the uptake facilitator AlkL were used as a whole-cell biocatalyst to oxyfunctionalize renewable fatty acid methyl esters [69]. However, extensive dodecanoic acid methyl ester uptake that was mediated by high AlkL levels led to whole-cell biocatalyst toxification. By fine-tuning the AlkL expression and reducing alkBGT expression, the product titre was increased from 4.3 to 229 g/L in a two-liquid phase bioprocess [69].\n\nReducing the degradation of substrate and product is important for increasing substrate utilization and thus increasing the overall conversion rate.

Whole-cell biocatalysis processes must, by definition, involve a growth process and a substrate conversion process. Cells are cultured, removed from the growth medium and then resuspended in different biotransformation media to convert substrates into desired products [3,13]. Several considerations influence the optimal growth of the biocatalyst, as with any fermentation, but the major issues regarding their use in biotransformations are the expression level(s) of the enzyme(s) of interest and the biomass yield. For most whole-cell biocatalysts that contain multistep pathways, coordinated expression, but not necessarily overexpression of the many enzymes involved in the pathways, is of great importance [16,41,49,51]. A good balance is a prerequisite for the efficiency of the biocatalyst. In single-step biotransformations, on the other hand, optimal overexpression of a single enzyme is usually sought [29,30]. In both cases, biomass is an important factor to consider in the cell growth process since a higher biomass, especially if obtained from a cheap fermentation medium, means a lower cost of the biocatalyst.\n\nTo implement a whole-cell biotransformation, the substrate of interest must be transported across the cell membrane to reach the active "

As described above, advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have markedly improved the productivities and yields of products that are synthesized using whole-cell biocatalysts.\n\nDespite the advantages outlined in this article, there are certain limitations that should be considered. The mass transport barrier that the cell membrane represents is one limitation. Cells often have a specific system to transport compounds in or out of the cell. Enhancing the transport system may help the transportation of substrates and products. Another method that can be used to improve substrate transfer across cell walls and membranes is to increase their permeabilization level by chemical means. However, these methods may damage the cell integrity and cause leakage of cellular components, complicating downstream process engineering; therefore, the best conditions for permeabilizing cells should be determined. Second, metabolic engineering strategies that are used in rational strain design involve the overexpression, deletion or down-regulation of genes in their native metabolic pathways "

Historically, enzymes from natural sources have been used to break down oils and proteins in laundry detergents, produce semisynthetic antibiotics, and create simple chiral precursors for the pharmaceutical industry. In the past 5 years, the number of available protein sequences has increased by a staggering 20-fold, accelerating the discovery of enzymes with useful activities and properties. Directed evolution, the cornerstone of our ability to tailor enzymatic properties, is allowing researchers to tailor enzymes for the synthesis of complex molecules, the modification of biological therapeutics, and the breakdown of plastic waste. Machine learning-driven proteinstructure prediction, coupled with advances in automation and high-throughput screening, is further advancing our ability to create enzymes with desired function. The ability to add nonbiological catalytic elements to enzymes means that enzyme engineers no longer have to rely solely on natural catalytic machinery. Scientists have thus gained the capacity to redesign, reimagine, and repurpose enzymes. Illustrative applications include enzyme cascades to manufacture the antivirals islatravir and molnupiravir, biocatalysts that can generate and control radicals, and enzymes that exploit photocatalysis to affect stereocontrolled C-C couplings, hydroaminations, or Diels-Alder reactions.\n\nADVANCES: The past 5 year"

Inspired by the precise control that enzymes can exert over reaction outcomes, chemists are using biocatalytic transformations that complement or even substitute for more traditional chemical routes (2).

Early uses of biocatalysis relied on accessible wildtype enzymes used in food or other industries to produce laundry detergents, semisynthetic antibiotics, and simple chiral precursors for the pharmaceutical industry (3)(4)(5). Although such repurposing still occurs occasionally, most new applications require the discovery of enzymes with distinct reactivity or the engineering of existing enzymes to catalyze the desired reaction, accept the desired substrate, and be stable and active at the desired application conditions.
