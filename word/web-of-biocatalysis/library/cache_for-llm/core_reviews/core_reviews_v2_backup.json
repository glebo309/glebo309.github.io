For example, nitrile hydratases are used to make acrylamide on the thousands of tons scale, and enzymes have been added to detergents for more than 30 years 1,2 . More recently, the use of proteins as catalysts for chemical synthesis of more complex molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, has become increasingly widespread. Enzymes are particularly powerful because they merge the advantages of a directing group controlling selectivity and a catalyst in a single reagent 3 , which can also be used with other enzymes in a one-pot reaction. Over the past 20 years, combined synthetic-enzymatic systems have enabled multiple total synthesis endeavours, and the use of enzymes is becoming routine in some process chemistry groups in industry 4 . Until recently, only a subset of enzymes, such as lipases or ketoreductases (KREDs), were available for chemical synthesis applications 5 . However, the growth of potential sources of enzymes for process chemistry applications has accelerated, resulting in a diverse toolkit of enzymes now available to researchers. In 2014, the development of a total enzymatic synthesis of the nucleoside didanosine highlighted the possibility of 'bio-retrosynthesis' 6 . Based on the principles of retrosynthesis, where the target molecule is transformed into simple precursors by 'breaking' bonds that can be formed from synthetic transformations, 'bio-retrosynthesis' involves the"

The definition of 'cascade' is generally broadly applied within the biocatalysis community to describe not only concurrent, multienzyme processes in one pot but also reactions in which components are added sequentially or process steps are telescoped despite attempts to impart order on the nomenclature [99][100][101][102] .\n\nThe development of novel biocatalytic cascades can be broadly described by a design-build-optimize cycle (Fig. 6b) until a final process is achieved 3,103 .

High productivities of 50-100 g l -1 h -1 have been achieved using free-resting Rhodococcus cells containing nitrile hydratase for the synthesis of acrylamide from acrylonitrile, considered to be one of the most successful industrial biocatalytic processes 140,141 .

The first snippet mentions how enzymes have been used for decades in industrial processes like acrylamide production and detergents, and highlights their unique advantage of combining directing groups with catalytic activity. The second snippet discusses enzyme sourcing strategies - commercial sources, biosynthesis adaptation, metagenomic libraries, and computational mining. The third snippet focuses on commercial availability of enzymes and screening approaches.\n\nI need to be careful to avoid redundancy while hitting all key points. For the Background paragraph, I'll emphasize historical context and fundamental advantages of enzymes. The Advances section should cover the four sourcing strategies mentioned, with special attention to how computational methods are transforming this field. The Outlook paragraph will address future directions like non-canonical amino acids and optimization techniques from the snippets.\n\nThe word count is tight - 200-300 words total. I'll aim for about 70 words per paragraph. Must use precise scientific language without jargon overload. Should avoid mentioning specific figures (Fig 1/2) since abstracts typically don't reference figures.

The most applied class of enzymes are the hydrolases. Almost 50% of all enzyme applications concern hydrolysis or synthesis of esters or amides, but also nitriles. As the majority of the enzyme catalysed reactions are performed in water, hydrolase catalysed reactions are a straightforward starting point, with the obvious advantage that the solvent is a reagent. Since it is always in huge excess the equilibrium of the reaction automatically is on the hydrolysis side. This chemistry is today fully developed; as is the application of hydrolases in dry solvent to revert the equilibrium to prepare esters or amides. Even for nitriles viable routes have been developed, as highlighted below (Scheme 28). Indeed, this chemistry is today textbook chemistry 7,8 and is therefore not covered in this review.\n\nThree recent developments will however be highlighted that added greatly to scope of the chemistry: ester and amide synthesis is water, PET hydrolysis and nitrile formation."

The second and third waves ensured that today biocatalysis is based on an understanding of the enzymes, including their scaffolds, which allows rapid identification of countless variations of a specific enzymatic activity, making a catalyst available for essentially all substrates with the functional group the synthetic chemist wishes to modify. More importantly, new reactions can be catalysed that were beforehand considered outside the scope of enzymes. This, in combination with an improved understanding of kinetics and thermodynamics governing the reactions, today allow the fast, efficient and clean synthesis of very complex structures under very mild conditions.\n\nNew types of biocatalytic reactions remain to be unravelled with already known or soon to be discovered enzymes that would allow access to further classes of molecules.

P450 monooxygenases such as the enzyme from Bacillus megaterium (P450BM3) have been studied extensively for the ring-hydroxylation of benzene and its derivatives.

It allows to utilise synthons that are at first glance very different from the desired product. Nature struggles with similar synthetic problems as chemists do in the laboratory (this should in particular be true in natural product synthesis) and thus a multitude of enzymes is available that catalyses selective interconversions.\n\n2.3.1 Reactions around the carboxylate group. The most applied class of enzymes are the hydrolases. Almost 50% of all enzyme applications concern hydrolysis or synthesis of esters or amides, but also nitriles. As the majority of the enzyme catalysed reactions are performed in water, hydrolase catalysed reactions are a straightforward starting point, with the obvious advantage that the solvent is a reagent. Since it is always in huge excess the equilibrium of the reaction automatically is on the hydrolysis side. This chemistry is today fully developed; as is the application of hydrolases in dry solvent to revert the equilibrium to prepare esters or amides. Even for nitriles viable routes have been developed, as highlighted below (Scheme 28). Indeed, this chemistry is today textbook chemistry 7,8 and is therefore not covered in this review.\n\nThree recent developments will however be highlighted that added greatly to scope of the chemistry: ester and amide synthesis is water, PET hydrolysis and nitrile formation."

It was demonstrated that the reactions was independent of whether ethyl acetate or water was the solvent.

The first wave of biocatalysis was rather limited in the number of reactions that it enabled. Often only a single enzyme was available for the desired reaction. This landscape has completely changed. The second and third waves ensured that today biocatalysis is based on an understanding of the enzymes, including their scaffolds, which allows rapid identification of countless variations of a specific enzymatic activity, making a catalyst available for essentially all substrates with the functional group the synthetic chemist wishes to modify. More importantly, new reactions can be catalysed that were beforehand considered outside the scope of enzymes. This, in combination with an improved understanding of kinetics and thermodynamics governing the reactions, today allow the fast, efficient and clean synthesis of very complex structures under very mild conditions.\n\nNew types of biocatalytic reactions remain to be unravelled with already known or soon to be discovered enzymes that would allow access to further classes of molecules. With this, biocatalysis is part of the many waves of change in chemistry."

There's mention of how this early enzyme work challenged the idea of \"vis vitalis\" (special forces) needed for organic synthesis. The text then contrasts this with current limitations - while biocatalysis has made significant waves in organic synthesis, it's not yet the universal solution for all chemical conversions. \n\nFor the Advances section, I need to highlight how C-C bond forming enzymes have been crucial, especially in total synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry where their selectivity shines. The snippets mention that enzymes like hydroxynitrile lyase (PaHNL) were early examples, and there's a reference to Rosenthaler. But importantly, the text notes that enzyme selectivity currently limits broad applications - no single enzyme does Friedel-Crafts reactions like AlCl3 does.\n\nFor the Outlook paragraph, I should emphasize the current gap: while biocatalysis complements existing tools, it hasn't yet replaced all chemical methods. The key challenge is developing enzymes with broader substrate scope (like for Fried",

In this review, we will try to make a brief summary of the most interesting and recent advances in these topics.

Moreover, the immobilized enzyme molecules will not be in contact with any external hydrophobic interface, such as air bubbles originated by supplying some required gases or promoted by strong stirring, necessary to control pH. These gas bubbles may produce enzyme inactivation of soluble proteins [19][20][21][22], but cannot inactivate the enzymes immobilized on a porous solid [23,24] (Fig. 1).\n\nIn the presence of an organic solvent phase, the immobilized enzymes may be in contact with the molecules of solvent which are soluble in the aqueous phase, but not with the organic phaseinterface, preventing this inactivation cause again.\n\nThus, any immobilization protocol of an enzyme which yields the enzyme immobilized inside a porous solid as the final product may permit an \"operational stabilization\" of the enzyme, even without really affecting the structural stability of the enzyme, simply by the mechanisms described above.\n\nHowever, this stabilization is not universally associated to the immobilization.

Now, the relative distances among all residues involved in the multipoint immobilization have to be maintained unaltered during any conformational change induced by any distorting agent (heat, organic solvents, extreme pH values). This should reduce any conformational change involved in enzyme inactivation and greatly increase the enzyme stability.\n\nHowever, to achieve these intense multipoint covalent attachments between the enzyme and the support -two dissimilar and rigid structures -is not a trivial problem. It becomes necessary to choose suitable immobilization systems to take advantages of the prospects of these techniques. Some authors had even discarded the possibility of getting a significant stabilization by this technique, due to the only moderate geometric congruence between the enzyme and the support [11,13,14].\n\nThus, the characteristics of the support, reactive groups and immobilization conditions need to be carefully selected to be able to involve the maximum number of enzyme groups in the immobilization. In fact, it has been possible to correlate the enzyme stabilization reached with the number of enzyme-support linkages [29]."

Only if there many reactive groups in the support under the protein surface, an intense multipoint covalent attachment may be achieved. • The reactive groups in the protein and the support should present minimal steric hindrances in the reaction, because after the initial immobilization, multipoint covalent attachment requires the contact between groups bound to rigid structures. • The reactive groups in the support should react with groups frequently placed in the enzyme surface. • The reactive groups involved in the immobilization should be stable enough to permit long enzyme-support reaction periods. • It should be easy to get a final inert surface in the support after immobilization, by destroying or blocking the remaining reactive groups in the support without affecting the enzyme.\n\nAmong the immobilization protocols described in literature, there are some that may fulfill most of these requirements.

Immobilization conditions should favor the enzyme-support reaction [30,41]. Some of these critical variables are:\n\n• Reaction time. Although immobilization may be very rapid, multipoint interaction between the non-complementary enzyme and support surfaces is a slow and time-dependent process: it requires the correct alignment of groups located in the already immobilized, and partially rigidified enzyme, and the rigid surface of the support. • pH value. Although immobilization may be performed at neutral pH value in many cases, incubation at alkaline pH values, where the reactivity of the nucleophiles of the protein (usually Lys) may be improved, is convenient to reach a high enzyme-support reaction. It should be kept in mind that while terminal amino groups may have a pK between 7 and 8, exposed Lys groups will present a pK over 10.5. • Temperature. Moderately high temperature may favor the vibration of enzyme and support, increasing the possibilities of getting more enzyme-support linkages. • Buffers.

However, if properly designed, results achieved via immobilization techniques may be really impressive, perfectly comparable to any other stabilization technique. For example, Table 1 shows some of the results obtained after immobilizing many different proteins on glyoxyl agarose under optimal conditions (see Refs. [23,24,29,30,33,). The stabilization factors are in many cases extremely high (1000-10,000-fold factors) with activity recoveries usually over 60%.\n\nThe use of epoxy-activated supports also may give very good results, perhaps lower that glyoxyl agarose but still very significant (see Table 2) [31,[71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86].

The inactivation of these enzymes starts, in many instances, by the dissociation of the enzyme in its individual subunits [87]. Even if this is not relevant for enzyme stability, the release of enzyme subunits may contaminate the final product (e.g., a food). Stabilization of multimeric enzymes by genetic engineering may be too complex, leaving the immobilization or the chemical modification as the simplest strategies to solve the dissociation problem of oligomeric proteins. However, in this case the immobilization-stabilization strategy should consider this multimeric nature of the enzyme, pursuing not only the multipoint attachment of the protein, but also the multisubunit attachment. The ideas behind will be very similar to the previously described for the multipoint covalent attachment. Thus, the multimeric structure of dimeric enzymes may be easily stabilized by immobilization on highly activated supports [88].\n\nSome successful examples of this strategy obtained in our laboratory are: d-amino acid oxidases from Trigonopsis variabilis and Rodotorula gracilis [35,51], formate dehydrogenases from Pseudomas sp. and Candida boidini [24,70], alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver [68] (Fig. 3).

However, in some cases, the enzyme may have two forms with very different activity, and if we were able to fix the enzyme form with higher activity, the final immobilized preparation may be more active than the native one. One of the clearest examples of this is the case of lipases. Lipases show two different conformations. The closed form, considered inactive, where the active site is isolated from the reaction medium by a polypeptide chain called lid, and the open form, where this lid is displaced and the active site is fully exposed to the reaction medium [95][96][97][98]. Both forms of lipases are in an equilibrium affected by the experimental conditions. In the presence of hydrophobic drops of substrate, lipases may become strongly adsorbed on the interface of these drops and the conformational equilibrium is shifted towards the open form of the lipases.\n\nFrom these features, two strategies to get immobilized lipases molecules with an improved activity have been developed, both trying to fix the open form of the lipase."

Thus, Braco and co-workers [101] described the improved activity of lipases precipitated in the presence of detergents and used in organic medium. This idea has been used by many authors [102][103][104]. Unfortunately, the lack of chemical stabilization of these aggregates made them only useful in organic medium, being re-dissolved in aqueous medium. Recently, Sheldon and co-workers showed that the preparation of CLEAs of lipases in the presence of detergents may permit to get improved lipase activity, very likely by fixing the open form of lipases during crosslinking [105]. These CLEAs, chemically crosslinked, could be already used in any reaction media without risking re-dissolution.\n\nRecently, the stabilization of the open forms of lipases adsorbed on aminated supports has been shown. To this goal, immobilized lipases from different source were incubated in the presence of detergents and then, the crosslinking with glutaraldehyde of the amino groups placed in the support and in the enzyme was attempted. Results suggested that this is a good option to get lipases exhibiting a higher catalytic activity [106] (Fig. 6).

Among the many tools to improve the enzyme selectivity (e.g., protein engineering or directed evolution [107][108][109][110]), again it is possible to find the protein immobilization as a powerful technique.\n\nImmobilization of a protein may produce some distortion on the active site, reducing the overall mobility of the protein groups. Moreover, enzymes that suffer great conformational changes during catalysis could have these changes distorted when immobilized, producing immobilized enzymes with fully altered catalytic properties. The requirement to utilize the possibilities of this distortion is to be able to access to a large battery of supports to immobilize proteins and of immobilization protocols that may permit to control the immobilization. This may permit the immobilization of a protein via different regions, conferring different rigidity and distorting the enzyme in very different ways, it may be even possible to generate different micro-environments around the enzyme bearing very different physical properties.

Fortunately, there are many techniques available that may permit to improve the enzyme features, involving many areas of science that have suffered impressive developments in the last years: microbiology, protein engineering, chemistry of proteins, etc. However, some apparently older fashioned techniques, as immobilization, have been revealed in the last times as a very powerful tool to improve almost all enzyme properties, if properly designed: e.g., stability, activity, specificity and selectivity, reduction of inhibition. In this review, we will try to make a brief summary of the most interesting and recent advances in these topics. Thus, more than a description of new immobilization protocols, we will focus on how immobilization may help to solve some of the problems of enzymes as industrial biocatalysts: enzyme recovery, enzyme stability, enzyme selectivity, reduction of inhibition by the medium or products.

Therefore, the enzyme needs to be very stable or to become highly stabilized during the immobilization process to be a suitable process.\n\nThus, although there are hundreds of immobilization protocols [3][4][5][6][7], the design of new protocols that may permit to improve the enzyme properties during immobilization is still a exciting goal.\n\nMoreover, bearing in mind that the final use will be as industrial catalyst, the ideal immobilization processes should limit the use of toxic or highly unstable reagents, be very simple, robust, etc."

Moreover, the immobilized enzyme molecules will not be in contact with any external hydrophobic interface, such as air bubbles originated by supplying some required gases or promoted by strong stirring, necessary to control pH. These gas bubbles may produce enzyme inactivation of soluble proteins [19][20][21][22], but cannot inactivate the enzymes immobilized on a porous solid [23,24] (Fig. 1).\n\nIn the presence of an organic solvent phase, the immobilized enzymes may be in contact with the molecules of solvent which are soluble in the aqueous phase, but not with the organic phaseinterface, preventing this inactivation cause again.\n\nThus, any immobilization protocol of an enzyme which yields the enzyme immobilized inside a porous solid as the final product may permit an \"operational stabilization\" of the enzyme, even without really affecting the structural stability of the enzyme, simply by the mechanisms described above.\n\nHowever, this stabilization is not universally associated to the immobilization.

Now, the relative distances among all residues involved in the multipoint immobilization have to be maintained unaltered during any conformational change induced by any distorting agent (heat, organic solvents, extreme pH values). This should reduce any conformational change involved in enzyme inactivation and greatly increase the enzyme stability.\n\nHowever, to achieve these intense multipoint covalent attachments between the enzyme and the support -two dissimilar and rigid structures -is not a trivial problem. It becomes necessary to choose suitable immobilization systems to take advantages of the prospects of these techniques. Some authors had even discarded the possibility of getting a significant stabilization by this technique, due to the only moderate geometric congruence between the enzyme and the support [11,13,14].\n\nThus, the characteristics of the support, reactive groups and immobilization conditions need to be carefully selected to be able to involve the maximum number of enzyme groups in the immobilization. In fact, it has been possible to correlate the enzyme stabilization reached with the number of enzyme-support linkages [29]."

Immobilization conditions should favor the enzyme-support reaction [30,41]. Some of these critical variables are:\n\n• Reaction time. Although immobilization may be very rapid, multipoint interaction between the non-complementary enzyme and support surfaces is a slow and time-dependent process: it requires the correct alignment of groups located in the already immobilized, and partially rigidified enzyme, and the rigid surface of the support. • pH value. Although immobilization may be performed at neutral pH value in many cases, incubation at alkaline pH values, where the reactivity of the nucleophiles of the protein (usually Lys) may be improved, is convenient to reach a high enzyme-support reaction. It should be kept in mind that while terminal amino groups may have a pK between 7 and 8, exposed Lys groups will present a pK over 10.5. • Temperature. Moderately high temperature may favor the vibration of enzyme and support, increasing the possibilities of getting more enzyme-support linkages. • Buffers. It should be chosen buffers that do not interfere in the reaction. For example borate may interfere in the aldehyde-amine reaction; amino compounds (Tris, ethanol amine) may modify epoxy supports or compete with the Lys by aldehyde groups [30]. • Inhibit"

However, if properly designed, results achieved via immobilization techniques may be really impressive, perfectly comparable to any other stabilization technique. For example, Table 1 shows some of the results obtained after immobilizing many different proteins on glyoxyl agarose under optimal conditions (see Refs. [23,24,29,30,33,). The stabilization factors are in many cases extremely high (1000-10,000-fold factors) with activity recoveries usually over 60%.\n\nThe use of epoxy-activated supports also may give very good results, perhaps lower that glyoxyl agarose but still very significant (see Table 2) [31,[71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86]. In some cases, both supports have given similar results (e.g., penicillin acylase).\n\nMoreover, it should be considered that any other technique employed to get a stable enzyme (protein engineering, screening, etc.) may be compatible with the stabilization of the enzyme by multipoint covalent attachment, once immobilization will be a almost necessary step for the preparation of an industrial biocatalyst.

The inactivation of these enzymes starts, in many instances, by the dissociation of the enzyme in its individual subunits [87]. Even if this is not relevant for enzyme stability, the release of enzyme subunits may contaminate the final product (e.g., a food). Stabilization of multimeric enzymes by genetic engineering may be too complex, leaving the immobilization or the chemical modification as the simplest strategies to solve the dissociation problem of oligomeric proteins. However, in this case the immobilization-stabilization strategy should consider this multimeric nature of the enzyme, pursuing not only the multipoint attachment of the protein, but also the multisubunit attachment. The ideas behind will be very similar to the previously described for the multipoint covalent attachment. Thus, the multimeric structure of dimeric enzymes may be easily stabilized by immobilization on highly activated supports [88].\n\nSome successful examples of this strategy obtained in our laboratory are: d-amino acid oxidases from Trigonopsis variabilis and Rodotorula gracilis [35,51], formate dehydrogenases from Pseudomas sp. and Candida boidini [24,70], alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver [68] (Fig. 3).

However, in some cases, the enzyme may have two forms with very different activity, and if we were able to fix the enzyme form with higher activity, the final immobilized preparation may be more active than the native one. One of the clearest examples of this is the case of lipases. Lipases show two different conformations. The closed form, considered inactive, where the active site is isolated from the reaction medium by a polypeptide chain called lid, and the open form, where this lid is displaced and the active site is fully exposed to the reaction medium [95][96][97][98]. Both forms of lipases are in an equilibrium affected by the experimental conditions. In the presence of hydrophobic drops of substrate, lipases may become strongly adsorbed on the interface of these drops and the conformational equilibrium is shifted towards the open form of the lipases.\n\nFrom these features, two strategies to get immobilized lipases molecules with an improved activity have been developed, both trying to fix the open form of the lipase."

This permits to get immobilized preparations highly hyperactivated, mainly against small and hydrophobic substrates (even by a 20-fold factor) [99].

This idea has been used by many authors [102][103][104]. Unfortunately, the lack of chemical stabilization of these aggregates made them only useful in organic medium, being re-dissolved in aqueous medium. Recently, Sheldon and co-workers showed that the preparation of CLEAs of lipases in the presence of detergents may permit to get improved lipase activity, very likely by fixing the open form of lipases during crosslinking [105]. These CLEAs, chemically crosslinked, could be already used in any reaction media without risking re-dissolution.\n\nRecently, the stabilization of the open forms of lipases adsorbed on aminated supports has been shown. To this goal, immobilized lipases from different source were incubated in the presence of detergents and then, the crosslinking with glutaraldehyde of the amino groups placed in the support and in the enzyme was attempted. Results suggested that this is a good option to get lipases exhibiting a higher catalytic activity [106] (Fig. 6).

Among the many tools to improve the enzyme selectivity (e.g., protein engineering or directed evolution [107][108][109][110]), again it is possible to find the protein immobilization as a powerful technique.\n\nImmobilization of a protein may produce some distortion on the active site, reducing the overall mobility of the protein groups.

They need it formatted into three specific paragraphs: Background, Advances, and Outlook.\n\nLooking at the body snippets, I see they cover several key points about enzyme immobilization. The first snippet mentions enzymes' excellent properties (high activity, selectivity, specificity) and how engineering them for industrial use is exciting. It also notes that immobilization techniques can improve these features across various scientific fields. \n\nThe second snippet focuses on economic benefits - how immobilized enzymes allow recovery/reuse, simplify reactor design, and stop reactions via simple filtration. It emphasizes that immobilization is usually required for industrial biocatalysts to solve solubility issues.\n\nThe third snippet discusses stability improvements being conditional - random immobilization might not enhance rigidity and could even decrease stability if the support causes undesirable interactions. The text cuts off mid-sentence with \"Next, we will show the different 'leve\" so I'll need to infer what comes next about techniques that do improve stability.\n\nI should structure this carefully: \nFor Background (first paragraph), I'll cover why enzymes are valuable but face solubility challenges, and how immobilization addresses this. \nFor Advances (second paragraph), I'll highlight how proper immobilization techniques can enhance stability without compromising activity/selectivi",

Also, there's no contact with hydrophobic interfaces like air bubbles that might inactivate enzymes during pH control.\n\nI should focus on the core ideas - the porous structure provides isolation, the protection mechanisms (preventing aggr"

The microtiter plate format (96-and 384-well) currently dominates screening assays and will likely continue to do so for some time. The reasons for this are that microtiter plate readers are commonly available, microtiter plates offer unmatched flexibility in sample manipulation, a vast collection of protocols have been published, and it is easy to increase throughput by robotic automation. In practice, microtiter plate assays are limited to screening several tens of thousands of clones. This can be sufficient if single site-saturation or small combinatorial libraries have to be screened. 29,30 While these methods are still applicable to larger random and combinatorial libraries, they are not capable of screening a significant fraction of the library diversity. 31 One solution to this problem is to make the wells smaller, going through 1536-well plates to microcapillary arrays. Chen et al. reported the use of microcapillary arrays for HTP screening. While the flexibility of microtiter plates is lost, this method potentially has much higher throughput than using plates. 32,33 Continuing this miniaturisation down a third dimension turns the capillaries into droplets. Droplets of an aqueous phase in an oil phase can be created by simple vortexing (polydisperse) or using sophisticated pumps and microfluidic chips. 34,35 Microfluidic droplets are highly monodisperse, commonly with less than 2% vari"

          "text": "Traditional HTP screening methods for enzyme activity mainly use absorption, ultraviolet, or fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the concentrations of substrates, products, or cofactors. However, many of these methods cannot meet the requirements of UHTP screening and it is also difficult to accurately evaluate the performance of each enzymatic step in a multi-enzyme cascade in real-time. Likewise, efficient manufacturing by engineered microbial cell factories regularly suffers from metabolic imbalances arising from the introduction and expression of (heterologous) pathways, impaired microbial growth due to the drain of cellular resources, the cytotoxicity of substrates and metabolites, as well as unintended contextual effects, ultimately lowering yields and product titres. [70][71][72] Hence, fine-tuning of (heterologous) pathway expression, maintaining cell viability, and maximising metabolic fluxes towards the desired product are equally important. 70,72 The performance of microbial cell factories is usually assessed by the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the metabolites produced through chromatographical methods. However, these can be timeconsuming at only low to moderate sample throughput, therefore, impeding the development and optimisation of microbial cell factories.

However, the extraction of natural products from original organisms often requires huge planting and breeding resources with limitations to season and region. Therefore, heterologous biosynthesis of natural products in vitro or in model microorganisms is a more promising way and has been a research hotspot for decades. At present, the use of heterologous pathways for natural products still mainly replicates the biosynthetic pathways present in the original hosts. However, due to the dependence of enzyme expression and coenzyme/ energy cycles in the original host organism and the intracellular environment, the same synthetic pathway is hard to replicate in model microorganisms or in vitro. Therefore, some optimisation strategies from the viewpoint of biochemistry and organic chemistry are widely used, including but not limited to (i) discovery of novel enzymes and protein interactions in the original metabolic pathways with well-studied catalytic and interaction mechanisms to provide novel enzyme tools for synthetic pathway design, (ii) substitution of enzymes in natural synthetic pathways with isoenzymes derived from microorganisms, (iii) replacement of natural synthetic pathways with microbial degradation pathways and artificial enzymatic cascades, (iv) design of artificial coenzyme regeneration pathways, and (v) protein engineering of key enzymes by rational design and/or directed evolution to impro"

Polyketide synthases can be several megadaltons in size, often several-fold larger than ribosomes. 433 It is therefore not surprising that polyketides are also valuable to humans as pesticides (spinosyn A), antibiotics (erythromycin), antineoplastics (daunorubicin), immunosuppressants (FK506), antifungal (neoaureothin), antitumor (epothilone B), antiparasitic (avermectin), and cholesterollowering (lovastatin) drugs. 434 Most of this rich diversity is produced by the modular Type I or ''assembly-line'' polyketide synthases. 435 Polyketides are an excellent example of the central theme of this review, which is to demonstrate that it is still difficult to achieve the total enzymatic synthesis of natural products without the original host organism. In this case, the reason is not merely the complexity of host metabolic pathways, but also the extreme complexity of the megasynthases themselves.

The previous studies have mostly focused on single-step enzymatic reactions or simple multi-step enzymatic cascades to synthesise intermediates with high value. At present, more attempts are involved in the total biosynthesis of drug compounds with complex structures. Since drug molecules mostly contain non-natural structures, the design of their biosynthetic pathways has more challenges in comparison to natural products. An effective strategy is to introduce artificially designed enzymatic cascades on the basis of related natural synthetic pathways, which can reduce the complexity of pathway design. Moreover, de novo biosynthetic pathways require screening of novel enzymes or modification of existing enzymes through protein engineering to obtain biocatalysts with sufficient activity, specificity, and stability that meet the requirements of drug synthesis. Furthermore, some auxiliary enzymatic cascades are also designed to optimise the supply of cofactors and reduce the formation of by-products in the synthetic pathway. Here, we illustrate a few selected successful examples of enzymatic total synthesis of drugs and important enzymatic cascades to elaborate how novel enzymes and enzymatic cascades are involved in the de novo enzymatic synthesis of drug compounds."

Since in the salvage pathway the enzymatic reactions catalysed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), phosphopentomutase (PPM) and deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) are all reversible, the retrosynthetic route thus formed is feasible in terms of reaction kinetics and more efficient than the natural synthetic route of nucleotides. Therefore, following this retrosynthetic route, islatravir was synthesised by a three-step enzymatic cascade with 2-ethynylglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetaldehyde as starting materials. Furthermore, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral 2-ethynylglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate also follows a retrosynthetic pathway, through which the target compound is obtained by sequential oxidation and phosphorylation catalysed by galactose oxidase (GOase) and pantothenate kinase (PanK) with non-chiral 2-ethynylglycerol as starting material.

Briefly, fatty acids are formed into olivetolic acid (OA) or divarinic acid (DA) under catalysis by the olivetol synthase and olivetolic acid cyclase, and then prenylated by cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) synthase with GPP as donor and further cyclised by cannabinoid synthase.\n\nBy integrating OA, GPP, and cannabinoid synthetic modules, Keasling and his colleagues realised the construction of a cannabinoid synthetic pathway in yeast.

IkaA catalyses the formation of tetramic acid from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and L-ornithine via an unusual iterative PKS/NRPS mechanism. IkaB and IkaC are reductases catalyzing the cyclisation of tetramic acid via the formation of the outer and inner bonds of the carbocycle, respectively. Gulder and his colleagues constructed a cascade of these three enzymes in vitro as an effective way for the total synthesis of ikarugamycin (Scheme 11). 476 The genes of IkaA, B and C from the ikarugamycin-producing Strepomyces sp.

First, EncN catalyses an ATP-dependent activation and transfers benzoate to the acyl carrier protein EncC. Then, the benzoyl unit migrates from EncC to the ketone synthase heterodimer EncA-EncB. The resting EncC is malonated under the catalysis of malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD), followed by a Claisen condensation reaction between benzoyl and malonyl units.

Recently, the total synthesis of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in yeast has been achieved by Smolke and Srinivasan with simple amino acids as starting materials (Scheme 15). 483 The most critical step in the enzymatic synthesis of hyoscyamine and scopolamine is to use tropine and phenyllactic acid (PLA) glucoside as acceptor and donor, respectively, to generate littorine through transacylation, followed by reduction and epoxidation to produce the final products.

In practice, microtiter plate assays are limited to screening several tens of thousands of clones. This can be sufficient if single site-saturation or small combinatorial libraries have to be screened. 29,30 While these methods are still applicable to larger random and combinatorial libraries, they are not capable of screening a significant fraction of the library diversity. 31 One solution to this problem is to make the wells smaller, going through 1536-well plates to microcapillary arrays.

Thus, many alkaloids are privileged compounds exhibiting biological and pharmacological activities (e.g., analgesic, anticancer, antibacterial, stimulant, etc.). Although the majority of important alkaloids are currently produced and extracted from the native or engineered plants or plant tissue culture, it is more promising to produce them in heterologous microbes (in vivo) or in vitro with biosynthetic enzymes because of (i) advanced technologies for engineering and optimising microbial production; (ii) much cleaner targeted products with less byproducts, and (iii) the potential to access analogues and derivatives.

Polyketide synthases can be several megadaltons in size, often several-fold larger than ribosomes. 433 It is therefore not surprising that polyketides are also valuable to humans as pesticides (spinosyn A), antibiotics (erythromycin), antineoplastics (daunorubicin), immunosuppressants (FK506), antifungal (neoaureothin), antitumor (epothilone B), antiparasitic (avermectin), and cholesterollowering (lovastatin) drugs. 434 Most of this rich diversity is produced by the modular Type I or ''assembly-line'' polyketide synthases. 435 Polyketides are an excellent example of the central theme of this review, which is to demonstrate that it is still difficult to achieve the total enzymatic synthesis of natural products without the original host organism. In this case, the reason is not merely the complexity of host metabolic pathways, but also the extreme complexity of the megasynthases themselves. Their sheer sizes make cloning and standard DNA manipulations complicated.

The previous studies have mostly focused on single-step enzymatic reactions or simple multi-step enzymatic cascades to synthesise intermediates with high value. At present, more attempts are involved in the total biosynthesis of drug compounds with complex structures. Since drug molecules mostly contain non-natural structures, the design of their biosynthetic pathways has more challenges in comparison to natural products. An effective strategy is to introduce artificially designed enzymatic cascades on the basis of related natural synthetic pathways, which can reduce the complexity of pathway design. Moreover, de novo biosynthetic pathways require screening of novel enzymes or modification of existing enzymes through protein engineering to obtain biocatalysts with sufficient activity, specificity, and stability that meet the requirements of drug synthesis. Furthermore, some auxiliary enzymatic cascades are also designed to optimise the supply of cofactors and reduce the formation of by-products in the synthetic pathway. Here, we illustrate a few selected successful examples of enzymatic total synthesis of drugs and important enzymatic cascades to elaborate how novel enzymes and enzymatic cascades are involved in the de novo enzymatic synthesis of drug compounds."

Recently, its total enzymatic synthesis has been achieved by Merck & Co., Inc and Codexis (Scheme 9). 471 The design of the enzymatic synthetic route did not follow the de novo synthesis of the nucleotide, but referred to the nucleoside salvage pathway in bacteria. Since in the salvage pathway the enzymatic reactions catalysed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), phosphopentomutase (PPM) and deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) are all reversible, the retrosynthetic route thus formed is feasible in terms of reaction kinetics and more efficient than the natural synthetic route of nucleotides. Therefore, following this retrosynthetic route, islatravir was synthesised by a three-step enzymatic cascade with 2-ethynylglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetaldehyde as starting materials. Furthermore, the enzymatic synthesis of chiral 2-ethynylglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate also follows a retrosynthetic pathway, through which the target compound is obtained by sequential oxidation and phosphorylation catalysed by galactose oxidase (GOase) and pantothenate kinase (PanK) with non-chiral 2-ethynylglycerol as starting material.

The synthetic pathway of cannabinoids integrates the key enzymatic cascades of polyketides and terpenes biosynthesis. Briefly, fatty acids are formed into olivetolic acid (OA) or divarinic acid (DA) under catalysis by the olivetol synthase and olivetolic acid cyclase, and then prenylated by cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) synthase with GPP as donor and further cyclised by cannabinoid synthase.\n\nBy integrating OA, GPP, and cannabinoid synthetic modules, Keasling and his colleagues realised the construction of a cannabinoid synthetic pathway in yeast.

The chemical total synthesis of ikarugamycin normally requires around 30 steps with very low yield. However, the natural biosynthesis of ikarugamycin only involves three enzymes: IkaA, B and C. IkaA catalyses the formation of tetramic acid from acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and L-ornithine via an unusual iterative PKS/NRPS mechanism. IkaB and IkaC are reductases catalyzing the cyclisation of tetramic acid via the formation of the outer and inner bonds of the carbocycle, respectively. Gulder and his colleagues constructed a cascade of these three enzymes in vitro as an effective way for the total synthesis of ikarugamycin (Scheme 11). 476 The genes of IkaA, B and C from the ikarugamycin-producing Strepomyces sp.

Combining this with a phosphopantetheinyl transferase Sfp from Bacillus subtilis to activate the active-site serine residue of PKS/NRPS carrier proteins, the in vitro three-enzyme cascade was confirmed to achieve the synthesis of ikarugamycin with a yield of the purified product of 9%.

To prove this speculation, the genome sequencing and assembling of Digenea simplex were obtained by the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) that is a novel single-molecule, long-read sequencing platform being able to generate single reads in hundreds of kilobases, which greatly facilitates resolving tandemly duplicated genes and repeats in red macroalgae genomes.

First, EncN catalyses an ATP-dependent activation and transfers benzoate to the acyl carrier protein EncC. Then, the benzoyl unit migrates from EncC to the ketone synthase heterodimer EncA-EncB. The resting EncC is malonated under the catalysis of malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (FabD), followed by a Claisen condensation reaction between benzoyl and malonyl units. This reaction process is repeated six additional times to produce an octaketide, which is then reduced by the ketoreductase EncD to obtain an intermediate common to enterocin and wailupemycin.

Recently, the total synthesis of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in yeast has been achieved by Smolke and Srinivasan with simple amino acids as starting materials (Scheme 15). 483 The most critical step in the enzymatic synthesis of hyoscyamine and scopolamine is to use tropine and phenyllactic acid (PLA) glucoside as acceptor and donor, respectively, to generate littorine through transacylation, followed by reduction and epoxidation to produce the final products.

We exemplified this progress by recent examples dealing with novel enzymes, enzymatic mechanisms and cascades discovered in the study of common natural products. These achievements gradually complement the synthetic pathways for the enzymatic total synthesis of natural products. Besides, enzymatic photocatalysis just opened a new door to construct artificial enzymatic reactions and will bring new opportunities for the streamlining and optimisation of enzymatic synthesis pathways.

There's also a note about advanced technologies for enzyme discovery and design.\n\nI need to structure this carefully. For the Background paragraph, I'll focus on the historical progression from Rosenthaler's work through the three waves, emphasizing how it evolved from natural sources to modern approaches. The Advances paragraph should highlight current trends like computational methods, engineered enzymes, and photobiocatalysis (since Höhne works on that). The Outlook paragraph will address future directions based on the snippets - probably things like AI-driven design, cascade reactions, and sustainable applications.\n\nI have to be precise with word count (200-300 words total) and avoid redundancy.

While manufacturing of bulk chemicals including hydrocarbons, fertilizers, synthetic fibers, paper, wastewater, steel, methane, and iron ore can be dated back to 1771, continuous flow manufacturing of fine chemicals is relatively new. In this respect, recent research has advanced continuous flow synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), [1][2][3][4][5] value-added chemicals, [6][7][8][9] modern agrochemicals, [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] and materials for hydrogen capture, storage, and electronics. [18][19][20][21] The concept of flow chemistry is simple. A fluid containing starting material is pumped through a reactor in a continuous manner to yield a stream of product (Fig. 1). A pump (or series of pumps) injects the solution(s) into the reactor, and these can be grouped into semi-continuous and continuous pumps. Semi-continuous pumps (e.g., syringe pumps) require refilling the syringe, while continuous pumps do not require refilling, and can theoretically process solutions indefinitely (Fig. 2).\n\nContinuous flow reactors are typically constructed from metals, glass, and plastic, with the most common material being PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) tubing. While plastic reactors are the most common, metal reactors can withstand higher temperatures and pressures, and can be constructed from catalytic metals such as copper.

The protein of interest will complex to the Ni-NTA resin allowing selective protein removal from bulk solution.

The system showed impressive stability over 240 h with no loss in biocatalytic activity at 4 1C. However, at 30 1C, more than 60% of biocatalytic activity was lost in 40 h.\n\nIn 2003, a continuous system for producing non-reducing maltodextrins was developed. 136 Trehalosyl-dextrin-forming enzyme was found in the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, but could be easily expressed in E. coli.

First, a plug flow reactor achieved 30% conversion in 228 min, while the second reactor, a CSTR, required 355 min. The stainless steel packed bed reactor housing 4.1 g of lipase was operated for 220 h at a flow rate of 28 mL min À1 (302 min residence time) to yield 32% conversion, 47% ee, and 1.38 g of (1R,2S) trans-2phenyl-1-cyclohexanol propionate.

Here, the second reaction requires the co-factor NADP(H); using whole cells provides the co-factor.

The Coflore ACR is a dynamically mixed plug flow reactor that uses moving agitators to promote mixing (Fig. 47B), while the Coflore ATR is a tubeshaped reactor using lateral movement (like twisting a spring in a horizontal direction) for improved mass transfer in two-phase reactions (Fig. 47C). Given that oxygen is required for this biocatalytic process, it was an ideal system to test the effects of scaling on reactor performance. As expected, increasing the batch reactor size from 250 mL to 4 L decreased the reaction rate; four hours were required to reach B50% conversion in a 250 mL reactor vs. 25 h in a 4 L reactor.

Chemicals typically move in a mono-directional flow with limited reverse diffusion back down the reactor. Thus, once a sacrificial reductant such as a hydride transfer reagent is used, it can only be regenerated via interaction with chemicals in that individual flow segment or the surface of the continuous flow reactor. In contrast, sacrificial reductants or hydride transfer reagents in batch reactors can be regenerated easily as there is multi-directional diffusion. This next section examines current state-of-the-art continuous flow co-factor regeneration methods.\n\nCo-factors are low molecular weight organic or inorganic compounds required for enzyme function (Fig. 52). Metal co-factors include iron, magnesium, and zinc, which can play both structural and catalytic roles. The most popular co-factor examined in this Review is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which can exist either in an oxidized or reduced state, NAD + and NADH respectively. Enzymes use co-factors as reagents and co-catalysts during complex chemical transformations. For example, NADH can provide a hydride source during bioreduction.

            "text": "Continuous flow processing has been used extensively in industry since the early 20th century. While manufacturing of bulk chemicals including hydrocarbons, fertilizers, synthetic fibers, paper, wastewater, steel, methane, and iron ore can be dated back to 1771, continuous flow manufacturing of fine chemicals is relatively new. In this respect, recent research has advanced continuous flow synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), [1][2][3][4][5] value-added chemicals, [6][7][8][9] modern agrochemicals, [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] and materials for hydrogen capture, storage, and electronics. [18][19][20][21] The concept of flow chemistry is simple. A fluid containing starting material is pumped through a reactor in a continuous manner to yield a stream of product (Fig. 1). A pump (or series of pumps) injects the solution(s) into the reactor, and these can be grouped into semi-continuous and continuous pumps. Semi-continuous pumps (e.g., syringe pumps) require refilling the syringe, while continuous pumps do not require refilling, and can theoretically process solutions indefinitely (Fig. 2).\n\nContinuous flow reactors are typically constructed from metals, glass, and plastic, with the most common material being PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) tubing. While plastic reactors are the most common, metal reactors can withstand higher temperatures and pressures, and can be constructed from catalytic metals such as copper.

            "text": "Affinity immobilization revolves around enzymes having different affinities for immobilization supports under different conditions. For example, during recombinant protein expression a polyhistidine affinity tag (His n -tag) is often encoded at a protein terminus. This His n -tag allows protein purification on nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin, as the His n -tag has an affinity for the resin under fairly neutral buffer conditions (pH 8.0). The protein of interest will complex to the Ni-NTA resin allowing selective protein removal from bulk solution. Once the protein of interest is isolated, adding 250 mM imidazole, or lowering the pH of the solution, will leach the protein from the resin. 124,125 Affinity immobilization supports can be categorized into two groups. First, the matrix is pre-coupled to an affinity ligand (such as the NTA ligand mentioned above), or second, the enzyme is pre-bound to an affinity ligand that gets incorporated into a matrix.

The system showed impressive stability over 240 h with no loss in biocatalytic activity at 4 1C. However, at 30 1C, more than 60% of biocatalytic activity was lost in 40 h.\n\nIn 2003, a continuous system for producing non-reducing maltodextrins was developed. 136 Trehalosyl-dextrin-forming enzyme was found in the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, but could be easily expressed in E. coli. Here, E. coli were permeabilized before immobilization onto supports including polyacrylamide, egg white, chitosan, and calcium-alginate.

Such advances will include new technology, reactors, and approaches, and some of the problems and solutions of transferring from batch to continuous flow.\n\nArcher et al., conducted an elegant examination of two continuous flow reactors vs. a batch reactor. 184 Here, a Coflore agitated cell reactor (Coflore ACR), and a Coflore agitated tube reactor (Coflore ATR) were compared to a batch reactor for chiral resolution of racemic amino acids using non-immobilized whole cells with (D)-amino acid oxidase (Fig. 47A). The Coflore ACR is a dynamically mixed plug flow reactor that uses moving agitators to promote mixing (Fig. 47B), while the Coflore ATR is a tubeshaped reactor using lateral movement (like twisting a spring in a horizontal direction) for improved mass transfer in two-phase reactions (Fig. 47C). Given that oxygen is required for this biocatalytic process, it was an ideal system to test the effects of scaling on reactor performance. As expected, increasing the batch reactor size from 250 mL to 4 L decreased the reaction rate; four hours were required to reach B50% conversion in a 250 mL reactor vs. 25 h in a 4 L reactor. Additionally, both continuous flow reactors improved the reaction rates due to improved mass transfer; in the ACR, B75% conversion was achieved in two hours compared to only B50%.

            "text": "Co-factor recycling is critical for efficient biocatalysis; however, this process can be difficult to engineer in continuous flow. Chemicals typically move in a mono-directional flow with limited reverse diffusion back down the reactor. Thus, once a sacrificial reductant such as a hydride transfer reagent is used, it can only be regenerated via interaction with chemicals in that individual flow segment or the surface of the continuous flow reactor. In contrast, sacrificial reductants or hydride transfer reagents in batch reactors can be regenerated easily as there is multi-directional diffusion. This next section examines current state-of-the-art continuous flow co-factor regeneration methods.\n\nCo-factors are low molecular weight organic or inorganic compounds required for enzyme function (Fig. 52). Metal co-factors include iron, magnesium, and zinc, which can play both structural and catalytic roles. The most popular co-factor examined in this Review is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which can exist either in an oxidized or reduced state, NAD + and NADH respectively. Enzymes use co-factors as reagents and co-catalysts during complex chemical transformations. For example, NADH can provide a hydride source during bioreduction.

They probably need this for a paper submission or literature review. The word count restriction (200-300 words) suggests it's for publication where conciseness is key.

Consequently, the cascade approach can lead to higher yields compared to a classical sequence of single-step transformations while at the same time increasing the synthetic efficiency by saving operational workup steps and resources. Additionally, cascades may help to reduce the amount of waste, since less chemicals (e.g., by circumventing work up) are used.\n\nCascades may be ideal to avoid the need for applying toxic compounds as initial substrate, since these reagents might be generated in situ and consumed as soon as formed.\n\nCombining catalysts and reagents in a single pot and performing reactions simultaneously require all reaction conditions to be compatible with each other, which could be challenging, for instance, in case the pH range of the individual catalysts does not overlap; also, the temperature needs to be considered, since multiple enzymes in a cascade may have different optimum operational temperatures, especially if thermophilic enzymes are employed. In case a cosolvent is required to improve the solubility of the substrate in the aqueous phase, all enzymes must tolerate the solvent.\n\nFurthermore, the overall reaction cascade must be energetically favored. 17 If this"

The biotransformation of styrene derivatives to diols was performed in a twophase system consisting of buffer and n-hexadecane in a 1:1 mixture using resting E. coli whole cells coexpressing the two enzymes of the cascade, namely, a styrene monooxygenase (SMO) from Sphingomonas sp. and an epoxide hydrolase (EH) (Scheme 130). 398 By the choice of a suitable epoxide hydrolase, both the (S)-diol as well as the (R)-diol could be prepared from the (S)-epoxide due to complementary regioselectivity. Thus, opening of the (S)-epoxide by attack of water at the α-carbon atom led to inversion of configuration and hence afforded the (R)-diol, while epoxide hydrolysis via attack at the β-carbon proceeded with stereochemical retention to give the (S)-diol. Regeneration of the nicotinamide cofactor required for the monooxygenation step relied on cell metabolism, with D-glucose being added as sacrificial cosubstrate. For instance, (S)-1phenylethane-1,2-diol (R = H), a synthetic precursor of the antidepressant (R)-fluoxetine, was obtained with >99% conversion and 98% ee.\n\nVery recently, both natural and non-natural diterpenes were accessed via combinatorial biocatalysis permutating two types of enzyme (Scheme 131). 399 The combinatorial approach is based on class II (set of 11 enzymes) and class I diterpene synthases (set of nine enzymes) from various plant sources.

For instance, alkane monooxygenase AlkBGT from P. putida GPo1 was coexpressed with a transaminase from C. violaceum in E. coli, and resting cells of the recombinant biocatalyst were used for the synthesis of 12-aminododecanoic acid methyl ester (Scheme 132A), 400 a polymer building block. 401 The monooxygenase AlkBGT was able to catalyze two subsequent transformations, namely, the hydroxylation in the first step and the alcohol oxidation to the aldehyde in the second step. Addditonally, AlkBGT was also responsible for an undesired side reaction, the overoxidation of the aldehyde to the diacid monoester. 402 The cofactor required by the monooxygenase, NADH, was provided via cell metabolism; NADH was also required for removal of the transamination byproduct, pyruvate. However, the amine donor for the transaminase, L-alanine, had to be supplied externally in a concentration of 50 mM. Using 1.4 g/L (cell dry-weight) of the biocatalyst, 0.13 mM (4.5%) ω-amino ester was produced from 2.9 mM methyl dodecanoate within 90 min, along with equal levels of the diacid monoester. Extension of the substrate scope to nonfunctionalized hydrocarbons was also possible, as demonstrated by the production of 1-octylamine (0.22 mM) from n-octane (1.4 mM). 403 The pr"

            "text": "Looking at the year of publication of the papers on artificial cascades in this review, it becomes apparent that there was a constant increase in the number of publications per year during the past decade (2007, ∼8; 2010, ∼20; 2013, ∼50; 2016, ∼60). Already between submission and revision of this review numerous further papers on cascades have been published. [415][416][417][418][419][420][421][422][423][424][425][426][427][428][429] It can be assumed that this is a result of enzymes becoming more easily accessible, improved enzyme engineering methods, as well as improved expression tools. As a consequence, one can expect the number of artificial cascades to increase further and cascades to become more complex. At the moment, the majority of cascades have two reaction steps in the linear sequence. Complexity can easily be achieved by combining or extending these two reaction step cascades. Additionally, as more and more different types of enzymes become available, more cascades become feasible, leading to an exponential growth of cascade designs. Also, in addition to sugars, novel activated (e.g., phosphorylated) substrates may become more easily accessible, e.g., by novel/improved methods for ATP regeneration, 430 thereby opening a new avenue of possibilities. 431 Additionally, the number of cascades combining enzymes with established chemical reactions or organocatalysts and metal catalysts can be expected to grow. The review shows that in contrast to the large number of ca"

          "text": "Process chemists have long recognized the need to consider both environmental and economic metrics when developing processes that ultimately will find application in chemicals manufacture. Beyond stoichiometric reagent use, catalysis offers significant benefits, and today, increasing emphasis is being placed on biologically mediated chemical reactions, more generally termed bioconversion. The scope of bioconversion is very broad, and it is instructive to classify bioconversions into two main types. 1 The first type is growth-associated whole-cell bioconversion, which is usually defined as fermentation. In such cases, the reactant (often termed the substrate) is used for the production of the biocatalyst (and its maintenance), as well as the reaction of interest, and furthermore, the productivity is coupled to the growth rate of the cells (which can be low in aerobic fermentations). In contrast, biocatalytic processes can be defined as those in which the production of the biocatalyst (enzyme or \"resting\" cell) and the conversion step operate independently. Today, fermentation processes have been established for the production of a range of products (including amino acids from modified Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli). 2 Other products include lactic acid, succinic acid, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3 as well as recent attempts toward itaconic acid and adipic acid. 4 Never-theless, in this review, we shall be concerned only with this second type, namely, bioconv"

Likewise, cofactors might be used suboptimally, because they might also be used elsewhere in the metabolic network. Additionally, substrates and products can be decomposed through competing cellular reactions, thereby lowering the yield. Finally, such a scheme also has the disadvantage of potential substrate diffusional limitations into cells, which can result when non-natural substrates are used, because no active transport mechanism into the cell is available. 6 Unsurprisingly, this effect is more pronounced in the conversion of bulky substrates. 7 The second group, isolated enzyme biocatalysis, is schematically shown in Figure 1b and represents those reactions where the enzyme is used outside the cell in which it was produced. Primarily, this approach attempts to overcome the diffusional limitations of substrates into (and products out of) cells. In such cases, either the enzyme has been secreted during the fermentation or the cells need to be disrupted following fermentation (and the cell debris removed), to produce a soluble, although unpurified, enzyme. Using an unpurified protein avoids the added cost of purification. Provided that it does not contain protea"

A paradigm shift was clearly needed, from traditional concepts of reaction efficiency and selectivity, which focus largely on chemical yield, to one that assigns value to the maximization of raw materials utilization, elimination of waste, and avoidance of the use of toxic and/or hazardous substances. 14,15 There was a pressing need for alternative, cleaner chemistry that was more resource-efficient and produced less waste. As a result of increasing environmental awareness, emphasis gradually switched to waste prevention at the source as opposed to waste remediation and pollution control by end-of-pipe solutions. The U.S. Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 16 focused attention on the need to reduce environmental pollution and recognized that waste prevention at the source not only eliminates the cost of waste treatment but actually strengthens economic competitiveness through a more efficient use of raw materials. This act led to a fundamental shift in the strategy for environmental protectionfrom \"end-of-pipe\" waste treatment to waste preventionand led to the emergence of the term \"green chemistry\" at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the early 1990s.\n\nA succinct definition of green chemistry is as follows: Green chemistry ef f iciently utilizes (preferably renewable) raw materials, eliminates waste and avoids the use of toxic and/or ha"

Mineral acids (H 2 SO 4 , HF, H 3 PO 4 ) and Lewis acids (AlCl 3 , ZnCl 2 , BF 3 ), employed as reagents in the reaction or in downstream processing, are another major source of waste. In addition, because of the molecular complexity of most pharmaceuticals, their synthesis involves multistep syntheses that are likely to generate more waste than those of simpler commodity chemicals. The solution to these problems is evident: substitution of these wasteful stoichiometric methodologies with more atom-and step-economical 22 catalytic alternatives.

Moreover, the growing need for cost-effective methods for the industrial synthesis of pure enantiomers of chiral drugs 26 provided an opportunity for the broad application of highly enantioselective biocatalytic methods. 27 However, at that time, widespread application was limited by the paucity of commercially available enzymes, which consisted mainly of hydrolases, such as lipases and proteases, used in food and beverage processing and laundry detergents. Largely thanks to advances in biotechnology, this situation has changed dramatically in the past two decades. Taking advantage of advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing, more than 20000 bacterial and fungal genomes have been sequenced, and the data have become available in the public domain. Currently, a target gene can be identified in silico by \"genome mining\" of such databases. The gene can then be synthesized, within a week; subsequently cloned into a host microorganism; and thanks to recombinant DNA technology, produced on an industrial scale for acceptable prices.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, it was necessary to modify the process to accommodate the available enzyme.

Indeed, if it is not possible to measure the sustainability of a process, it is not possible to benchmark it and define targets for improvement. Likewise, industrial implementation necessitates quantitative measures to assess improvements to processes to justify the required investment. The two oldest green metrics are atom economy 52 and the E factor, 14,53 first proposed in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Atom economy (AE) is calculated by dividing the molecular weight of the product by the sum total of the molecular weights of all substances formed in the stoichiometric equation for the reaction The E factor, in contrast, is the actual amount of waste produced in the process. It takes the product yield into account, along with waste from all of the auxiliary operations, for example, solvent losses and chemicals used in workup. In the original publication, 14 waste was defined as \"everything but the desired product\", with the exception of water. The rationale for excluding water was that including it could lead to a skewing of E factors, making meaningful comparison of processes difficult. That is, an otherwise waste-free process using substantial amounts of water could be construed as being less green than a process producing much more undesirable waste but using little water.

It is generally perceived as an advantage that enzymes function optimally in water, but this can be a serious shortcoming if the organic substrate is only sparingly soluble in water. Moreover, some reactions such as (trans)esterifications and amidations cannot be conducted in water owing to equilibrium limitations and/or product hydrolysis. Hence, there is a long-standing interest in nonaqueous biocatalysis. 81 However, the use of volatile organic solvents in biocatalytic processes is subject to the same caveats as organic syntheses in general. Moreover, highly polar substrates, such as carbohydrates, nucleosides, and peptides, are sparingly soluble in common organic solvents. In addition, enzymes generally denature in polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF).

However, removing water (the most plentiful component) is expensive on account of its high boiling point. Indeed, a simple economic analysis of many biocatalytic processes reveals the importance of achieving sufficient product concentration leaving the reactor, to reduce the burden of water removal downstream. It should also be mentioned that, if water is used as the solvent, it still has to be treated to remove traces of organics before it can be discharged (and the complete E factor includes water). 82 Hence, high substrate concentrations (preferably 10 wt % or more), or even suspensions of substrates, should be used to limit the amount of water. Despite these challenges to the conventional wisdom of replacing some of the water with organic solvent, it remains the case that the majority of biocatalytic processes are carried out in water. Unlike many conventional chemical processes, where the purity of the product leaving the reactor reflects the downstream processing cost, in the case of aqueous-based systems, it is the product concentration that dominates, because the costs of removing water are so significant. General guidelines reflecting the value of the product have been reported between 50 g/L for high-priced products to 300 g/L for low-priced products. 83 For product streams up to 300 g/L, it is always necess"

Most organic substrates are sparingly soluble in water, and some reactions, such as (trans)esterifications and amidations, cannot be conducted in water owing to competing product hydrolysis. In addition, product recovery is easier from volatile organic solvents, and microbial contamination is eliminated. The reaction medium can also influence enzyme specificities, in particular, it can enhance or even invert the enantioselectivity (Table 2). 91 In short, medium engineering can be used to optimize the synthetic utility of enzymatic transformations. 92 On the other hand, environmental issues associated with many volatile organic solvents and polar aprotic solvents represent a serious drawback of biocatalysis in organic media.\n\nAnother drawback is that rates are generally much lower than in water. Enzymes are able to function as suspensions in organic solvents, but as one would a priori expect, the catalytic efficiency is orders of magnitude lower than that of the same enzyme dissolved in water. 93 Hence, if competing hydrolysis is not an issue, it probably makes more sense to conduct the reaction in an aqueous/organic biphasic system."

For example, mixing choline chloride (mp 302 °C) with urea (mp 132 °C) in a 1:2 molar ratio affords a DES with a melting point of 12 °C. DESs are, strictly speaking, not ILs because they contain uncharged moieties, but they exhibit similar properties, such as low volatility and high thermal stability.

Enzymes are soluble in water and, hence, difficult and costly to recover from aqueous effluents.

The enzyme costs per kilogram of product can, therefore, be substantially reduced by immobilization of the enzyme to form a free-flowing powder. Converting a homogeneous catalyst into a heterogeneous catalyst enables catalyst recovery and reuse, resulting in simplification of the process, improvement of the product quality, and reduction of the environmental footprint.\n\nA further benefit of immobilization is generally enhanced stability, toward denaturation by heat or organic solvents or by autolysis, as a result of the decrease in flexibility, which suppresses the propensity of enzymes toward unfolding and the accompanying loss of the tertiary structure necessary for activity.

An mCLEA of α-amylase was also prepared using pectin dialdehyde as the cross-linker with 95% activity recovery, compared to 85% using glutaraldehyde as the cross-linker. 376 The higher activity recovery was attributed to better mass transfer of macromolecular substrates in the more open porous structure.\n\nSimilarly, glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger was immobilized on magnetic polystyrene particles and used successfully in a magnetically stabilized fluidized-bed reactor (MSFBR). 377 It was necessary to use low f"

Hemicellulose has a more complicated structure than cellulose and requires a diverse suite of enzymes, including xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) and mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78), to effect its hydrolysis to its constituent sugars, mainly xylose and mannose.\n\nImmobilization of the cellulase enzyme cocktail on magnetic particles has been extensively studied, either on prefabricated magnetic (nano)carriers [384][385][386][387][388][389][390][391] or as magnetic CLEAs, [392][393][394] but activities were generally measured only in the hydrolysis of the water-soluble carboxymethyl cellulose as a model for the complex mixture derived from lignocellulose.

Although lignocellulose is available in very large quantities, it is much more difficult to process than first-generation feedstocks such as sucrose and starch. Some form of pretreatment, such as a steam explosion, ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX), or treatment with lime, is needed to open up the recalcitrant lignocellulose structure and render it accessible to the enzyme cocktail. 398 Pretreatment generally accounts for a large fraction of the total energy consumption of lignocellulose conversion. The reaction medium is, generally speaking, water, but alternatives have been considered. The organosolv process, for example, involves reaction at elevated temperatures (185-210 °C) in water/ organic solvent (e.g., ethanol) mixtures. 399 Alternatively, ILs and DESs are being considered as reaction media for the deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass. 400 The ultimate goal is to develop an integrated process for the pretreatment of the lignocellulose and enzymatic hydrolysis of the polysaccharides, coupled with efficient recycling of both the IL or DES and the (immobilized) enzyme. 401 The cellulase enzyme cocktail is known to be active and stable in designer ILs and DESs. 133 For example, cellulase was engineered to improve its stability in mixtures of ChCl/Gly and concentrated seawater as a low-cos"

These enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of monoterpene glycoconjugates present during winemaking to afford volatile terpenoids, which provide the aromatic aroma of wines. All grape varieties comprise such precursors, but Muscat grapes, in particular, have the highest concentrations. The enzymatic hydrolysis is a sequential twostep process.

However, such systems need significant protein engineering to improve activity and stability, so they can be made economical. For example, when coupled with dehydrogenases for the oxidation of alcohols (rather than the usual reduction of ketones), relatively poor process performance was observed, which was attributed, in part, to NOX inactivation. 411 (4) Care should also be taken with equilibrium-controlled conversions, where excess cosubstrates will lead to high E factors and ISPR will lead to further downstream complications.

            "text": "Process chemists have long recognized the need to consider both environmental and economic metrics when developing processes that ultimately will find application in chemicals manufacture. Beyond stoichiometric reagent use, catalysis offers significant benefits, and today, increasing emphasis is being placed on biologically mediated chemical reactions, more generally termed bioconversion. The scope of bioconversion is very broad, and it is instructive to classify bioconversions into two main types. 1 The first type is growth-associated whole-cell bioconversion, which is usually defined as fermentation. In such cases, the reactant (often termed the substrate) is used for the production of the biocatalyst (and its maintenance), as well as the reaction of interest, and furthermore, the productivity is coupled to the growth rate of the cells (which can be low in aerobic fermentations). In contrast, biocatalytic processes can be defined as those in which the production of the biocatalyst (enzyme or \"resting\" cell) and the conversion step operate independently. Today, fermentation processes have been established for the production of a range of products (including amino acids from modified Corynebacterium glutamicum and Escherichia coli). 2 Other products include lactic acid, succinic acid, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 3 as well as recent attempts toward itaconic acid and adipic acid. 4 Never-theless, in this review, we shall be concerned only with this second type, namely, bioconv"

Likewise, cofactors might be used suboptimally, because they might also be used elsewhere in the metabolic network. Additionally, substrates and products can be decomposed through competing cellular reactions, thereby lowering the yield. Finally, such a scheme also has the disadvantage of potential substrate diffusional limitations into cells, which can result when non-natural substrates are used, because no active transport mechanism into the cell is available. 6 Unsurprisingly, this effect is more pronounced in the conversion of bulky substrates. 7 The second group, isolated enzyme biocatalysis, is schematically shown in Figure 1b and represents those reactions where the enzyme is used outside the cell in which it was produced. Primarily, this approach attempts to overcome the diffusional limitations of substrates into (and products out of) cells. In such cases, either the enzyme has been secreted during the fermentation or the cells need to be disrupted following fermentation (and the cell debris removed), to produce a soluble, although unpurified, enzyme. Using an unpurified protein avoids the added cost of purification. Provided that it does not contain protea"

A paradigm shift was clearly needed, from traditional concepts of reaction efficiency and selectivity, which focus largely on chemical yield, to one that assigns value to the maximization of raw materials utilization, elimination of waste, and avoidance of the use of toxic and/or hazardous substances. 14,15 There was a pressing need for alternative, cleaner chemistry that was more resource-efficient and produced less waste. As a result of increasing environmental awareness, emphasis gradually switched to waste prevention at the source as opposed to waste remediation and pollution control by end-of-pipe solutions. The U.S. Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 16 focused attention on the need to reduce environmental pollution and recognized that waste prevention at the source not only eliminates the cost of waste treatment but actually strengthens economic competitiveness through a more efficient use of raw materials. This act led to a fundamental shift in the strategy for environmental protectionfrom \"end-of-pipe\" waste treatment to waste preventionand led to the emergence of the term \"green chemistry\" at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the early 1990s.\n\nA succinct definition of green chemistry is as follows: Green chemistry ef f iciently utilizes (preferably renewable) raw materials, eliminates waste and avoids the use of toxic and/or ha"

Moreover, the growing need for cost-effective methods for the industrial synthesis of pure enantiomers of chiral drugs 26 provided an opportunity for the broad application of highly enantioselective biocatalytic methods. 27 However, at that time, widespread application was limited by the paucity of commercially available enzymes, which consisted mainly of hydrolases, such as lipases and proteases, used in food and beverage processing and laundry detergents.

Indeed, a simple economic analysis of many biocatalytic processes reveals the importance of achieving sufficient product concentration leaving the reactor, to reduce the burden of water removal downstream. It should also be mentioned that, if water is used as the solvent, it still has to be treated to remove traces of organics before it can be discharged (and the complete E factor includes water). 82 Hence, high substrate concentrations (preferably 10 wt % or more), or even suspensions of substrates, should be used to limit the amount of water. Despite these challenges to the conventional wisdom of replacing some of the water with organic solvent, it remains the case that the majority of biocatalytic processes are carried out in water. Unlike many conventional chemical processes, where the purity of the product leaving the reactor reflects the downstream processing cost, in the case of aqueous-based systems, it is the product concentration that dominates, because the costs of removing water are so significant.

In this section, we discuss what can be achieved by engineering the other variables in biocatalysis: the substrate, the protein, the biocatalyst once formed, and the reactor configuration and downstream processing. The whole is referred to as biocatalysis engineering. 173 Although, historically, this was the order in which these fields were developed, meaning, for example, that many examples of substrate engineering were at the time restricted by a lack of established methods for protein engineering, in recent years, many of the examples have used engineered proteins. For this reason, we have placed developments in context by starting the discussion about protein engineering, followed by substrate engineering.\n\n4.1. Protein Engineering: Evolution in the Fast Lane 4.1.1. Historical Development. Wild-type enzymes evolved over millions of years to be active and specific with their natural substrates, under ambient conditions in water. In contrast, industrial processes, such as the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates, generally involve transformations of non-natural substrates under harsh conditions, namely, elevated temperatures and high substrate concentrations in the presence of organic solvents. Wild-type enzymes are often not effective under such conditions, which results in low selectivities, low activities, and low space-time yields. To exhibit in"

Amides were also prepared from the corresponding acids in a cascade of two reactions catalyzed by CaLB: esterification followed by ammoniolysis of the resulting ester.\n\nEnzymatic ammoniolysis can also be used for the kinetic resolution of chiral carboxylic acid esters and amino acid esters through amide formation catalyzed by both lipases and serine proteases. 207,208 Similarly, enzymatic reactions of esters with amines can also be used to resolve chiral amines. Although the reactions are generally too slow for industrial viability, BASF workers successfully developed, by substrate engineering of the acyl donor, a much faster reaction. Thus, in the BASF Chipros process (Figure 14), an ester of 2-methoxyacetic acid is used as an acyl donor, and the presence of the oxygen atom in the chain results in a dramatic rate increase, affording a highly effective resolution process that is performed at a multithousand-ton-peryear scale. 209,210 The reaction can be conducted solvent-free over a lipase-containing column.

In vivo, phytase accommodates a phosphate ester, phytate, in its active site. Because vanadium(V) exhibits coordination geometries similar to those of phosphorus(V), it was reasoned that the addition of vanadate to phytase should afford a robust and inexpensive vanadium peroxidase. This proved to be the case: Vanadate-substituted phytase catalyzed enantioselective sulfoxidations with hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, substitution of the zinc(II) ion in carbonic anhydrase with manganese(II) afforded a semisynthetic enzyme that, in the presence of bicarbonate, acted as a peroxidase. 217 It was further noted 215 that the \"combination of the concept of enzyme promiscuity with the technique of directed evolution could provide a powerful tool for the design and optimization of novel reactions with enzymes\".\n\nMore recently, Arnold and co-workers used heme-dependent enzymes, notably cytochrome P450s, a remarkable class of iron porphyrin-containing enzymes that play key roles in xenobiotic catabolism and natural product biosynthesis, as starting points for chemomimetic biocatalysis.

This enables its industrial production at relatively low cost. The following step involves its effective formulation. Enzymes are soluble in water and, hence, difficult and costly to recover from aqueous effluents. Consequently, many enzymes are employed on a single-use, throw-away basis, which is not cost-effective and not in line with current thinking on the circular economy. The enzyme costs per kilogram of product can, therefore, be substantially reduced by immobilization of the enzyme to form a free-flowing powder. Converting a homogeneous catalyst into a heterogeneous catalyst enables catalyst recovery and reuse, resulting in simplification of the process, improvement of the product quality, and reduction of the environmental footprint.\n\nA further benefit of immobilization is generally enhanced stability, toward denaturation by heat or organic solvents or by autolysis, as a result of the decrease in flexibility, which suppresses the propensity of enzymes toward unfolding and the accompanying loss of the tertiary structure necessary for activity. It also allows for a much broader choice of solvents. An illustrative example of the remarkable gains to be obtained by immobilization is provided by the sita"

It is well-known that the addition of salts, or water-miscible organic solvents or nonionic polymers, to aqueous solutions of proteins leads to their precipitation as physical aggregates that are held together by noncovalent bonding without perturbation of their tertiary structure. Addition of water to this precipitate results in redissolution of the enzyme. In contrast, cross-linking of these physical aggregates renders them permanently insoluble while maintaining their preorganized superstructure and, hence, their catalytic activity. The result was a new class of immobilized enzymes: cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs). 240 Because selective precipitation with ammonium sulfate is commonly used to purify enzymes, the CLEA methodology essentially combines two processes, purification and immobilization, into a single unit operation. The CLEA technology has subsequently been applied to the immobilization of a broad spectrum of enzymes and is the subject of several reviews. [241][242][243][244][245][246] 4.3.2.

The coupling is conducted in water, and the product crystallizes out of the reaction mixture. Crystallization of the product is essential as, otherwise, the enzyme would catalyze the subsequent hydrolysis of the product, which is the thermodynamically favored reaction. For commercial viability, the enzyme needs to be immobilized to enable its reuse, but then it has to be separated from the solid product, which presents quite a challenge. One possibility, which is practiced on an industrial scale, involves the use of a sieve-bottom reactor whereby the product can diffuse through the sieve bottom whereas the larger catalyst particles are retained in the reactor and can be reused with the following batch. 264 Another possibility is to use an mCLEA of penicillin G amidase and separate it magnetically.\n\nmCLEAs of the lipases CaLB 265 and surfactant-activated Thermomyces lanuginosus (TLL) 266 were used in the production of biodiesel from nonedible vegetable oils and waste cooking oils by transesterification with n-propanol and methanol, respectively.

For many high-priced products, such as pharmaceuticals, the reactions will be carried out on a relatively small scale (up to 1000 tonnes per year) and, therefore, in multipurpose reactors, usually stirred tanks equipped with a propeller or turbine stirrer, although there is a marked trend toward the use of flow reactors. 274,275 Stirred-tank reactors (STRs) have several beneficial characteristics such as the ability to mix well, meaning that multiphase reactions and reactions where additions are required (for pH control or substrate feeding) can be carried out effectively. As the production scale increases (more than 10000 tonnes per year), achieving sufficient volumetric productivity becomes critical so as to minimize the size of individual reactors. At a larger scale, mixing becomes expensive and needs to be limited to 0.5-2 W/ L, implying that some regions of the tank will be poorly mixed, leading to \"hot spots\" of reagent concentration and attendant enzyme deactivation.

However, mechanical attrition, as a result of shear forces caused by the stirrer, can lead to the pulverization of the immobilized enzyme particles, rendering them difficult to separate and reuse. Various reactor engineering solutions to this problem have been reported. For example, a membrane slurry reactor (MSR) retains the immobilized enzyme particles in the reactor by virtue of the fact that they are too large to pass through the pores of a membrane. The membrane consists of a patch in the wall of an existing STR and is relatively easy to implement. The substrate and product, on the other hand, can be pumped in and out of the reactor through the membrane. MSRs can be used in continuous mode with a wide range of catalyst particle sizes. The MSR has many benefits: high catalyst loadings, longer lifetimes owing to less mechanical stress, and high volumetric and catalyst productivities. The biocatalytic step and the separation step are combined into a single operation, and the MSR is suitable for use with the relatively small particles of some CLEAs.

As discussed previously, this leads to large and costly downstream equipment as well as inefficient processes. Despite attempts to improve the tolerance of enzymes to product through protein engineering, this remains difficult, and in many cases, therefore, removal of the product directly from the reactor can prove essential. Numerous documented reports attest to the value of in situ product removal (ISPR), which can afford orderof-magnitude improvements in the process. [285][286][287] This approach is analogous to that taken in conventional chemical engineering with process intensification technologies, such as reactive distillation. 288,289 The implementation of such schemes is essential to achieving sustainable biocatalytic processes. Some of the requirements of implementation are listed in Table 5 for ISPR (with external recycle, the usual mode of operation in industry).\n\nSome excellent examples of the implementation of ISPR into processes can be found in the literature concerning the enzymatic synthesis of sugars such as L-erythrulose, 290 the whole-cell synthesis of fluorocatechol, 291 and the enzymatic synthesis of cephalexin by complexation 292 and cefaclor, 293 leading to productivity increases.

A reduction in the number of steps, what Wender termed step economy, 325 will, in most cases, lead to a reduction in the amounts of reagents and solvents used and, hence, in the amounts of waste generated.

Biocatalytic processes frequently operate under mild conditions, as described earlier, which supports the concept of green chemistry for an individual reaction step. However, it is essential that the broadest possible view be taken. In many processes, the enzymatic step represents just one step among many synthetic steps in a complete synthetic scheme. To assess the overall sustainability of a process, the entire synthetic scheme needs to be considered. Changing reaction conditions (e.g., pH or temperature), or changing reaction media, in the middle of a synthetic route (even to enable a more benign individual step) can result in a suboptimal solution overall. One method for overcoming this difficulty is to ensure that the biocatalytic reaction is either the first or last step in a synthesis, but such a choice is rarely available and does not always make sense. A second strategy is to try to bring the conditions closer together, and invariably, this means operating biocatalytic reactions in media other than water.

Chemical synthesis processes are generally high-yield, however they are often environmentally unfriendly and are associated with the production of unwanted byproducts, thus reducing efficiency and increasing downstream costs. In comparison with chemical catalysis, whole-cell biocatalysis offer some unique advantages (Table 1) and provides an efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthesis for production of bulk and fine chemicals [1,2]. In the past several decades, many biocatalytic processes have been implemented to produce a wide variety of products in various industries [3,4]. The most important advantage of a biocatalyst is its high selectivity. The high selectivity, including regio-, chemo-, diastereo-and enantioselectivity, is very desirable in chemical synthesis and produces benefits such as reduced (or zero) use of protecting groups, minimized side reactions, easier separation of products, and fewer environmental problems [5]. Other advantages such as multi-step reactions in single strain with cofactor regeneration; high catalytic efficiency and mild conditions are also very attractive in commercial applications. In some cases, such as the asymmetric synthesis of chiral target compounds or the synthesis of some sophisticated chemicals, generating the desired products b"

Heterologous expression of genes from the designed pathway in E. coli can be controlled independent of the host's regulatory network [12,20], resulting in easy control of the product-forming pathway.

Whole-cell biocatalysis for one-step synthesis is especially preferred to catalysis by the isolated enzyme when the enzyme is unstable in vitro or requires expensive co-substrates or cofactors [29,30].

The reconstitution of the Ehrlich pathway in E. coli introduced the enzymes that perform the necessary decarboxylation and reduction steps into the bacterial cells and resulted in 2-PE production. Approximately 96% of the final product was produced from l-phenylalanine (based on the initial 40 mM l-phenylalanine) using the recombinant E. coli [34].

Thus, systematic optimization by metabolic engineering of both the specific pathways and the overall cellular chassis of the microbial cell factory is essential to enhance the biosynthesis of the target compound. In this section, we discuss the attempts at pathway flux maximization and chassis optimization using metabolic engineering. The strategies that were used to improve the engineered biosynthetic pathways included the identification of rate-controlling steps and relieving of bottlenecks, pathway balancing to eliminate the accumulation of toxic intermediates or by-products, and the maximization of the pathway's flux towards the product by, for example, blocking competing pathways, enhancing the supply of precursors and co-substrates, and improving the balance of cofactors [2,[11][12][13]46]. Metabolic engineering of the chassis is also necessary and may involve, among other approaches, increasing the cell's uptake of substrates, reducing substrate and product degradation and enhancing product transport [2,11,46]."

Once the bottleneck of the pathway is identified, its limiting power can be reduced by improving the expression of rate-controlling enzymes, substituting ratecontrolling enzymes with a higher activity from other species, and modifying the enzymes by protein engineering [16,45,47]. Enhancing the expression of the ratecontrolling enzyme is usually the easiest change to enact.\n\nA whole-cell biocatalyst for Neu5Ac production was developed by assembling a heterologous biosynthetic pathway in E. coli that consisted of AGE and NanA. NanA was identified to be the rate-controlling enzyme of the engineered pathway. Efforts had been made to alleviate the NanA bottleneck by manipulating the amount of the recombinant enzyme. When the expression of NanA increased, a nine-fold increase in Neu5Ac production was achieved [16]. For the biosynthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac), 7-O (or 9-O)-acetyltransferase (NeuD), CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (NeuA) and alpha-Neu5Ac alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (NeuS) were required [48].

Maximizing the flux of a synthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in obtaining the best volumetric productivity of a bioconversion and thus lowering the production cost of the targeted chemicals.\n\nA very illustrative example of these approaches is the optimization of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway to enhance isoprenoid production. The strategies aimed to balance the pathways and eliminate the accumulation of toxic intermediates in addition to maximizing the flux towards the product. A mevalonate-based isopentenyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis pathway (MVA) was introduced into an E. coli strain to produce large quantities of isoprenoids [47,50,51]. The MVA pathway was introduced into E. coli in the form of two synthetic operons, an \"upper pathway\" that converted acetyl-CoA to MVA and a \"lower pathway\" that produced dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) from MVA, that were a combination of bacterial and yeast enzymes [49,52].

When a heterologous pathway is introduced into a production host, the pathway will unavoidably compete with the native metabolism for common precursors. Consequently, elevating the levels of important precursors by redirecting the corresponding fluxes can be an efficient strategy to enhance production of target compounds.\n\nFor 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)dependent carotenoid biosynthesis, an imbalanced supply of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate precursors is one of the major metabolic bottlenecks, especially considering the limit of the G3P precursor's availability. Systematic modification of targets within central metabolic pathways was conducted to promote the redistribution of metabolic fluxes towards MEPdependent carotenoid biosynthesis. The flux to the EMP pathway was rewired towards the ED/PP pathways by knocking out phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Tweaking the flux at the branch point between ED and PP by overexpressing eda and fine-tuning gnd expression in a PGI-deficient strain (Δpgi) improved the G3P/Pyr supply and rebalanced precursor availability, which relieved the bottleneck.

In cells, the cofactors, such as nicotinamide, 2-oxoglutarate, acetyl-CoA and ATP, are mainly used in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle and are present at low concentrations. Cofactor supply and regeneration may be limited if the target biosynthetic reaction is rapid. Therefore, metabolic engineering to increase cofactor supply and regeneration is necessary. Cofactor recycling is key not only to lowering the cost of a process but also to driving the reaction of interest to completion.\n\nIncreased cofactor regeneration is traditionally accomplished using an in situ regeneration reaction (Fig. 2a). For oxidoreductase-catalysed reactions that depend on nicotinamide cofactors, cofactor recycling in whole-cell biocatalysts is achieved by cascading the reaction with a dehydrogenase and thus coupling the recycling of the nicotinamide cofactor to the conversion of a sacrificial co-substrate by formate dehydrogenase, glucose dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, phosphite dehydrogenase or hydrogenase [56][57][58][59].

Elimination of GlcNAc-specific PTS reduced GlcNAc-related side reactions and increased Neu5Ac production by 1.28-fold [39]. The outer membrane protein AlkL of P. putida GPo1 was reported to improve hydrophobic substrate uptake into E. coli [68]. E. coli cells overexpressing the monooxygenase system AlkBGT and the uptake facilitator AlkL were used as a whole-cell biocatalyst to oxyfunctionalize renewable fatty acid methyl esters [69].

Cells are cultured, removed from the growth medium and then resuspended in different biotransformation media to convert substrates into desired products [3,13]. Several considerations influence the optimal growth of the biocatalyst, as with any fermentation, but the major issues regarding their use in biotransformations are the expression level(s) of the enzyme(s) of interest and the biomass yield.

The identified pathways can be transferred to microbial hosts such as E. coli to generate heterologous biosynthesis pathways for the production of exogenous and non-natural molecules. Heterologous expression of genes from the designed pathway in E. coli can be controlled independent of the host's regulatory network [12,20], resulting in easy control of the product-forming pathway.

For whole-cell biocatalysis via single-step \"pathways\", recombinant plasmid-based expression of the enzyme results in high expression levels (overexpression) and thus make large amounts of the recombinant enzyme available. Whole-cell biocatalysis for one-step synthesis is especially preferred to catalysis by the isolated enzyme when the enzyme is unstable in vitro or requires expensive co-substrates or cofactors [29,30]. In these cases, enzymes should be screened for high activity, efficient heterologous expression, and a method of blocking the catabolism of the substrate and product, if present in the host cells, as they are the most important issues to be considered.\n\nA whole-cell catalyst that expressed a novel esterase (EstK1) in E. coli produced cinnamyl acetate as a result of its high transesterification activity. The conversion ratio of cinnamyl alcohol reached 94.1% at 1 h and was even higher (97.1%) at 2 h [31].

The aromatic alcohol 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) is synthesized from l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) via the three-step Ehrlich pathway in yeast and via the phenylacetaldehyde synthase (PAAS) pathway in plants. The reconstitution of the Ehrlich pathway in E. coli introduced the enzymes that perform the necessary decarboxylation and reduction steps into the bacterial cells and resulted in 2-PE production. Approximately 96% of the final product was produced from l-phenylalanine (based on the initial 40 mM l-phenylalanine) using the recombinant E. coli [34]. In another case, a novel pathway that used the PAAS from Rosa hybrid, a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)dependent enzyme and endogenous alcohol dehydrogenases was introduced into E. coli to produce 2-PE. This biotransformation, which was based only on internal de novo PLP synthesis, produced 0.34 g/L 2-PE [35,36].\n\nThe construction of de novo biosynthetic pathways denotes the assembly of genes from different nonrelated organisms to construct artificial pathways in the desired host. This approach enables retrosynthetic pathway design and opens the door to the development of unprecedented multistep biocatalysts.

However, these pathways rarely function optimally when first introduced into the host organism, resulting in suboptimal yields of the desired product [45]. Thus, systematic optimization by metabolic engineering of both the specific pathways and the overall cellular chassis of the microbial cell factory is essential to enhance the biosynthesis of the target compound. In this section, we discuss the attempts at pathway flux maximization and chassis optimization using metabolic engineering. The strategies that were used to improve the engineered biosynthetic pathways included the identification of rate-controlling steps and relieving of bottlenecks, pathway balancing to eliminate the accumulation of toxic intermediates or by-products, and the maximization of the pathway's flux towards the product by, for example, blocking competing pathways, enhancing the supply of precursors and co-substrates, and improving the balance of cofactors [2,[11][12][13]46]. Metabolic engineering of the chassis is also necessary and may involve, among other approaches, increasing the cell's uptake of substrates, reducing substrate and product degradation and enhancing product transport [2,11,46]."

The identification of ratecontrolling steps is particularly important in pathway optimization. Once the bottleneck of the pathway is identified, its limiting power can be reduced by improving the expression of rate-controlling enzymes, substituting ratecontrolling enzymes with a higher activity from other species, and modifying the enzymes by protein engineering [16,45,47]. Enhancing the expression of the ratecontrolling enzyme is usually the easiest change to enact.\n\nA whole-cell biocatalyst for Neu5Ac production was developed by assembling a heterologous biosynthetic pathway in E. coli that consisted of AGE and NanA. NanA was identified to be the rate-controlling enzyme of the engineered pathway. Efforts had been made to alleviate the NanA bottleneck by manipulating the amount of the recombinant enzyme. When the expression of NanA increased, a nine-fold increase in Neu5Ac production was achieved [16]. For the biosynthesis of polysialic acid (PSA), N-acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac), 7-O (or 9-O)-acetyltransferase (NeuD), CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase (NeuA) and alpha-Neu5Ac alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase (NeuS) were required [48].

Maximizing the flux of a synthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in obtaining the best volumetric productivity of a bioconversion and thus lowering the production cost of the targeted chemicals.\n\nA very illustrative example of these approaches is the optimization of the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway to enhance isoprenoid production. The strategies aimed to balance the pathways and eliminate the accumulation of toxic intermediates in addition to maximizing the flux towards the product. A mevalonate-based isopentenyl pyrophosphate biosynthesis pathway (MVA) was introduced into an E. coli strain to produce large quantities of isoprenoids [47,50,51]. The MVA pathway was introduced into E. coli in the form of two synthetic operons, an \"upper pathway\" that converted acetyl-CoA to MVA and a \"lower pathway\" that produced dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) from MVA, that were a combination of bacterial and yeast enzymes [49,52].

When the nanTEK genes of engineered E. coli were knocked out, Neu5Ac production was enhanced threefold, resulting in 173.8 mM Neu5Ac [16].

When a heterologous pathway is introduced into a production host, the pathway will unavoidably compete with the native metabolism for common precursors. Consequently, elevating the levels of important precursors by redirecting the corresponding fluxes can be an efficient strategy to enhance production of target compounds.\n\nFor 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)dependent carotenoid biosynthesis, an imbalanced supply of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and pyruvate precursors is one of the major metabolic bottlenecks, especially considering the limit of the G3P precursor's availability. Systematic modification of targets within central metabolic pathways was conducted to promote the redistribution of metabolic fluxes towards MEPdependent carotenoid biosynthesis. The flux to the EMP pathway was rewired towards the ED/PP pathways by knocking out phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Tweaking the flux at the branch point between ED and PP by overexpressing eda and fine-tuning gnd expression in a PGI-deficient strain (Δpgi) improved the G3P/Pyr supply and rebalanced precursor availability, which relieved the bottleneck.

In cells, the cofactors, such as nicotinamide, 2-oxoglutarate, acetyl-CoA and ATP, are mainly used in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle and are present at low concentrations. Cofactor supply and regeneration may be limited if the target biosynthetic reaction is rapid. Therefore, metabolic engineering to increase cofactor supply and regeneration is necessary. Cofactor recycling is key not only to lowering the cost of a process but also to driving the reaction of interest to completion.\n\nIncreased cofactor regeneration is traditionally accomplished using an in situ regeneration reaction (Fig. 2a). For oxidoreductase-catalysed reactions that depend on nicotinamide cofactors, cofactor recycling in whole-cell biocatalysts is achieved by cascading the reaction with a dehydrogenase and thus coupling the recycling of the nicotinamide cofactor to the conversion of a sacrificial co-substrate by formate dehydrogenase, glucose dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, phosphite dehydrogenase or hydrogenase [56][57][58][59].

Elimination of GlcNAc-specific PTS reduced GlcNAc-related side reactions and increased Neu5Ac production by 1.28-fold [39]. The outer membrane protein AlkL of P. putida GPo1 was reported to improve hydrophobic substrate uptake into E. coli [68]. E. coli cells overexpressing the monooxygenase system AlkBGT and the uptake facilitator AlkL were used as a whole-cell biocatalyst to oxyfunctionalize renewable fatty acid methyl esters [69].

Cells are cultured, removed from the growth medium and then resuspended in different biotransformation media to convert substrates into desired products [3,13]. Several considerations influence the optimal growth of the biocatalyst, as with any fermentation, but the major issues regarding their use in biotransformations are the expression level(s) of the enzyme(s) of interest and the biomass yield. For most whole-cell biocatalysts that contain multistep pathways, coordinated expression, but not necessarily overexpression of the many enzymes involved in the pathways, is of great importance [16,41,49,51]. A good balance is a prerequisite for the efficiency of the biocatalyst. In single-step biotransformations, on the other hand, optimal overexpression of a single enzyme is usually sought [29,30]. In both cases, biomass is an important factor to consider in the cell growth process since a higher biomass, especially if obtained from a cheap fermentation medium, means a lower cost of the biocatalyst.\n\nTo implement a whole-cell biotransformation, the substrate of interest must be transported across the cell membrane to reach the active "

Enhancing the transport system may help the transportation of substrates and products. Another method that can be used to improve substrate transfer across cell walls and membranes is to increase their permeabilization level by chemical means. However, these methods may damage the cell integrity and cause leakage of cellular components, complicating downstream process engineering; therefore, the best conditions for permeabilizing cells should be determined.

In all these applications, whole cell biocatalysts supply some unique advantages over the use of crude, purified, or immobilized enzyme preparations. In addition to being the cheapest form of catalyst formulation, whole cells already supply the cofactors needed for biotransformations and simplify their regeneration, usually making an external and expensive cofactor addition obsolete (see Section 'Cofactor regeneration'). Furthermore, residual cell wall compounds act in a protective manner also for resting or dead cells and thus enable enzyme applications under harsh reaction conditions or in unconventional (non-aqueous) reaction media [5]. Especially for hydrophobic substrates, applications in such media are strongly desired, as the originally proclaimed inherent greenness of biocatalytic reactions under aqueous conditions had to make way for a new perception: unconventional media can be ecologically advantageous, due to less generation of solvent waste during the reaction (less dilution) and during downstream processing (no extraction). Furthermore, such reactions become economically favorable due to higher product titers [6,7]. As a result, the combination of whole cell catalysts and unconventional reaction media is hi"

In a study on the cost contribution of biocatalyst production to biocatalytic processes, Tufvesson and co-workers found purified enzyme roughly 10-fold more expensive than whole cells [12]. Subsequent catalyst immobilization added even more costs to the analyzed process, with the carrier material being particularly impactful to the cost increase. Additionally, the scale in which whole cells are produced is decisive for the final catalyst price, meaning the bigger the scale the cheaper the catalyst (economy of scale). As soon as a sufficient market size for an aspired product is given, it is advisable to either invest into large scale production vessels or search for a contract manufacturer with appropriate facilities."

Consequently, especially reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases, depending on nicotinamide cofactors, are often performed in whole cells, while the cofactor is traditionally regenerated by conversion of a sacrificial cosubstrate or by regeneration in an enzyme-coupled approach [13 ]. Despite advances in the fields of electrochemical or photochemical regeneration methods [13 ], the coupling of enzymatic reactions in redox-neutral multi-step reactions found great interest recently. Here, monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed processes are frequently combined [14,15,16 ]. Of course, such approaches rely on proper balancing of reaction rates of both enzymatic reactions and on the effectiveness and efficiency of such a route to access the product of interest. Another novel strategy is the use of 'smart' diol cosubstrates (Figure 1) [17]. After double oxidation of the diol, a stable lactone ring is formed, which drives the thermodynamic equilibrium to the product side. Because of this shift and the supply of two reduction equivalents per molecule of cosubstrate, 90 mol% of cosubstrate are saved in comparison to traditional alcohol cosubstrates, which usually require at least a five-fold molar excess.

Nevertheless, increasing research effort has been spent on enzymatic conversions in unconventional media and the number of publications grows together with the increasing number and type of non-conventional solvents [5]. Because of numerous publications in these fields, we will neither consider lipasecatalyzed applications (which are frequently investigated in organic environment) [24] nor biphasic systems of water-immiscible organic solvent (which we consider as already widely known) [25]."

Alternatively, water or buffer is added resulting in a micro-aqueous system, in which ideally no second phase is observed as the water is taken up by the solvent or the catalyst [27]. In 2011, Jakoblinnert et al. applied lyophilized E. coli whole cells expressing Candida parapsilosis carbonyl reductase (CPCR) in a mixture of only acetophenone as main substrate and n-propanol as a cosubstrate for cofactor regeneration. After optimization, product titers of 300-500 g L À1 were reached and downstream processing involved only catalyst removal and the evaporation of cosubstrate and coproduct to get hands on gained (S)-phenylethanol (ee > 99%) [26]. Hibino and Ohtake took a similar approach, but expressed two Thermus thermophiles HB27 alcohol dehydrogenases in the hydrophobic expression host Rhodococcus rhodochrous NBRC15564.

Still, the advantages of high substrate loads, minimum water addition, and working in a monophasic system remain when diluting the substrates in organic solvent. As an example, the benefits of a micro-aqueous solvent system were demonstrated for the biocatalytic synthesis of cyanohydrins using recombinant E. coli cells containing Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL). Since product formation also proceeds non-catalytically in the presence of water, only the application in micro-aqueous methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) enabled the hydrocyanation in a stereoselective manner (ee > 98% for (R)-mandelonitrile) [30]. For a similarly executed carboligation of aldehydes, pronounced aldehyde reactivity/toxicity towards the catalyst forbade using a NSS. Nevertheless, substrate concentrations of 500 mM could be achieved in micro-aqueous MTBE in a 2-step reaction employing recombinant whole cell catalyst for carboligation and oxidoreduction, respectively. Even with highly inactivating acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde as substrates, space-time-yields and product concentration of the batch reactions were outstandingly high, with up to 327 g L À1 d À1 and 49 g L À1 for (1R,2R)-phenylpropane-1,2-diol production [27].\n\nDespite the benefits obtained from these organic systems, a current challenge remains in the desired switch to mor"

Good compatibility was generally found for imidazolium-based salts of short alkyl chain length, especially when they were mixed with alkyl sulfate anions [36], which might be another reason why these cations represent the most frequently used ILs in biocatalytic contexts in addition to their good commercial availability and wide application [35]. A trend of increasing catalyst activity with decreasing alkyl chain length described by Wood et al. was confirmed in the stereoselective reduction of ethyl acetoacetate using immobilized Acetobacter cells in biphasic systems [37].

Coexpression of multiple enzymes in one cell allows for an efficient reaction cascade due to the close proximity of catalysts for consecutive steps within a confined space. On the other hand, coexpression of multiple proteins may lead to a high metabolic burden during cell growth, which can result in poor overexpression and thus impaired catalytic performance [46]. Therefore, in some cases it can be beneficial to express each enzyme in single and later combine the cells into cascade reactions flexibly [27]. Anyhow, cascade biocatalysis becomes particularly sophisticated yet appealing when redox-neutral (see Section 'Cofactor regeneration') or recycling cascades [47] are designed. A couple of excellent and comprehensive reviews on synthetic cascade reactions can be suggested to the reader [48][49][50]."

After the first publication in 1998 employing the 'Lentikat' technology, numerous studied have been published on these lense-shaped polyvinyl alcohol immobilizates. A recent in depth characterization of Lentikat particles unveiled a pronounced physical strength of the lenses [51], making them well suited for stirred tank reactor setups. Of further importance, Lentikats including E. coli whole cell catalyst were proven storable for up to 15 month [52], enable almost identical reaction rates as free cells, and maintain their catalytic activity much better than freely suspended catalyst [53]. Another stabilizing technology is the silicone coating of recombinant E. coli adhesively grown on ion exchange resin. In doing so, hydrophobic as well as hydrophilized silicone coatings maintain the initial rate activity in comparison to uncoated immobilizate, whereas the hydrophobic coating even enables the immobilizate application in NSSs [54 ].\n\nApplications in which immobilization was used to enable highly productive reactor concepts were published recently with glutaraldehyde-crosslinked whole cell catalyst [55,56].

In some cases the use of dead whole cells can fullfill regulatory contraints. For almost any downstream processing challenge following biocatalytic reactions, technical solutions can be found [59].

A classical way to decrease this negative effect is the deliberate permeabilization of the cell wall compounds by treatment with surfactants, chelating agents, or organic solvent (Figure 2a) [11,62]. An alternative to enhance mass transfer is the coexpression of membrane transporters as recently shown for the biocatalytic conversion of C7 to C16 alkanes (Figure 2b). Coexpression of the alkL gene from Pseudomonas putida enhanced the cell specific product yield up to 100-fold, due to an increased substrate uptake [63 ]. Many more such examples of influx as well as efflux transporters potentially useful for biocatalysis have been summarized recently by Kell et al. [64]. Instead of enhancing the transfer of substrate towards the enzyme, others employed cell surface display techniques to rather bring the enzyme to the substrate (Figure 2c). As an example, Candida antarctica lipase B was displayed on Pichia pastoris, with the additional result of increased solvent and thermal stability [65]. Also for E. coli whole cell catalyst expressing a monooxygenase, the benefits of such systems have been demonstrated by Stro ¨hle et al. [66].

In all these applications, whole cell biocatalysts supply some unique advantages over the use of crude, purified, or immobilized enzyme preparations. In addition to being the cheapest form of catalyst formulation, whole cells already supply the cofactors needed for biotransformations and simplify their regeneration, usually making an external and expensive cofactor addition obsolete (see Section 'Cofactor regeneration'). Furthermore, residual cell wall compounds act in a protective manner also for resting or dead cells and thus enable enzyme applications under harsh reaction conditions or in unconventional (non-aqueous) reaction media [5]. Especially for hydrophobic substrates, applications in such media are strongly desired, as the originally proclaimed inherent greenness of biocatalytic reactions under aqueous conditions had to make way for a new perception: unconventional media can be ecologically advantageous, due to less generation of solvent waste during the reaction (less dilution) and during downstream processing (no extraction). Furthermore, such reactions become economically favorable due to higher product titers [6,7]. As a result, the combination of whole cell catalysts and unconventional reaction media is hi"

In a study on the cost contribution of biocatalyst production to biocatalytic processes, Tufvesson and co-workers found purified enzyme roughly 10-fold more expensive than whole cells [12]. Subsequent catalyst immobilization added even more costs to the analyzed process, with the carrier material being particularly impactful to the cost increase. Additionally, the scale in which whole cells are produced is decisive for the final catalyst price, meaning the bigger the scale the cheaper the catalyst (economy of scale). As soon as a sufficient market size for an aspired product is given, it is advisable to either invest into large scale production vessels or search for a contract manufacturer with appropriate facilities."

            "text": "Especially in the case of cofactor-dependent reactions, whole cell biocatalyst is frequently used, as the inherent presence of cofactors generated by the host itself and the ease of recycling grants significant advantages over the expensive external addition thereof. Consequently, especially reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases, depending on nicotinamide cofactors, are often performed in whole cells, while the cofactor is traditionally regenerated by conversion of a sacrificial cosubstrate or by regeneration in an enzyme-coupled approach [13 ]. Despite advances in the fields of electrochemical or photochemical regeneration methods [13 ], the coupling of enzymatic reactions in redox-neutral multi-step reactions found great interest recently. Here, monooxygenase and alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed processes are frequently combined [14,15,16 ]. Of course, such approaches rely on proper balancing of reaction rates of both enzymatic reactions and on the effectiveness and efficiency of such a route to access the product of interest. Another novel strategy is the use of 'smart' diol cosubstrates (Figure 1) [17]. After double oxidation of the diol, a stable lactone ring is formed, which drives the thermodynamic equilibrium to the product side. Because of this shift and the supply of two reduction equivalents per molecule of cosubstrate, 90 mol% of cosubstrate are saved in comparison to traditional alcohol cosubstrates, which usually require at least a five-fold molar excess.

Alternatively, water or buffer is added resulting in a micro-aqueous system, in which ideally no second phase is observed as the water is taken up by the solvent or the catalyst [27]. In 2011, Jakoblinnert et al. applied lyophilized E. coli whole cells expressing Candida parapsilosis carbonyl reductase (CPCR) in a mixture of only acetophenone as main substrate and n-propanol as a cosubstrate for cofactor regeneration. After optimization, product titers of 300-500 g L À1 were reached and downstream processing involved only catalyst removal and the evaporation of cosubstrate and coproduct to get hands on gained (S)-phenylethanol (ee > 99%) [26]. Hibino and Ohtake took a similar approach, but expressed two Thermus thermophiles HB27 alcohol dehydrogenases in the hydrophobic expression host Rhodococcus rhodochrous NBRC15564.

Still, the advantages of high substrate loads, minimum water addition, and working in a monophasic system remain when diluting the substrates in organic solvent. As an example, the benefits of a micro-aqueous solvent system were demonstrated for the biocatalytic synthesis of cyanohydrins using recombinant E. coli cells containing Arabidopsis thaliana hydroxynitrile lyase (AtHNL). Since product formation also proceeds non-catalytically in the presence of water, only the application in micro-aqueous methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) enabled the hydrocyanation in a stereoselective manner (ee > 98% for (R)-mandelonitrile) [30]. For a similarly executed carboligation of aldehydes, pronounced aldehyde reactivity/toxicity towards the catalyst forbade using a NSS. Nevertheless, substrate concentrations of 500 mM could be achieved in micro-aqueous MTBE in a 2-step reaction employing recombinant whole cell catalyst for carboligation and oxidoreduction, respectively. Even with highly inactivating acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde as substrates, space-time-yields and product concentration of the batch reactions were outstandingly high, with up to 327 g L À1 d À1 and 49 g L À1 for (1R,2R)-phenylpropane-1,2-diol production [27].\n\nDespite the benefits obtained from these organic systems, a current challenge remains in the desired switch to mor"

Good compatibility was generally found for imidazolium-based salts of short alkyl chain length, especially when they were mixed with alkyl sulfate anions [36], which might be another reason why these cations represent the most frequently used ILs in biocatalytic contexts in addition to their good commercial availability and wide application [35].

Therefore, in some cases it can be beneficial to express each enzyme in single and later combine the cells into cascade reactions flexibly [27]. Anyhow, cascade biocatalysis becomes particularly sophisticated yet appealing when redox-neutral (see Section 'Cofactor regeneration') or recycling cascades [47] are designed.

Although biocatalysts are often highly active and extremely selective, there are still drawbacks associated with biocatalysis as a generally applicable technique: the lack of designability of biocatalysts; their limits of stability; and the insufficient number of well-characterized, ready-to-use biocatalysts.\n\nThere has been significant progress on the following fronts: (a) novel protein engineering tools, both experimental and computational, have significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development. (b) The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses can be described quantitatively via rational models. There are several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. The concept that stabilization against one type of stress commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. (c) A host of developments of novel biocatalysts in the past few years, in part fueled by improved designability and improved methods of stabilization, has considerably broadened the toolbox for synthetic chemistry."

Here, biocatalysts are understood to comprise any protein of a length that allows three-dimensional folding, known from statistical mechanics to start at approximately 20 amino acids in length. Therefore, RNA catalysts, cofactor-only catalysts, and other organocatalysts are not covered by this review.\n\nThe rapid spread of biocatalytic routes and targets in the past few years has been aided by advances in protein engineering as well as the increasing importance of both short, selective routes to pharmaceuticals and the synthesis of chemicals from renewables. Most of these syntheses are based on the processing of carbohydrates, lignocellulosics, and vegetable oils, rather than coal, oil, or natural gas. Several eminent reviews of the field have been published; as examples, the reader is referred to works by Turner (1), Bornscheuer et al. (2), and Reetz (3)."

The fairly frequent disulfide bonds between cysteines are formed through crosslinking of side-chain interactions but do not constitute branching of the backbone chain. Extremely rarely, an additional genetically coded twenty-first amino acid is found, such as selenocysteine in formate dehydrogenase or glutathione peroxidase (4,5), or pyrrolysine, the twenty-second amino acid, in methanogens (belonging to the domain of Archaea) (6,7). This review does not cover the body of excellent work performed to incorporate nonproteinogenic and often even unnatural amino acids into proteins [for reviews, see Ngo & Tirrell (8) and Xiao et al.

Monomers of enzymes typically consist of 147 (bovine lysozyme) to 667 (alcohol oxidase from Aspergillus or Pichia) amino acid residues, most of them clustering between 280 and 400 residues. Protein sequences are searchable with a variety of algorithm-based tools, such as BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), ClustalW (http://www.clustal.org), or FASTA (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml), in a variety of databases, such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://"

Operation at near ambient conditions promises energy efficiency of biocatalytic processes. Typical renewable raw materials, such as carbohydrates or fatty acids, are more hydrophilic than raw materials obtained from petrochemicals, which tend to be hydrocarbons. Such hydrophilic raw materials are advantageously processed in aqueous solvents, so biocatalysis is a good technological fit for renewable raw materials."

The development of enzymes from nature and improvement through random mutagenesis are perceived this way. 2. A decisive weakness of biocatalysts is their very limited range of stability with respect to temperature, solvents, pH value, ionic strength, and salt type.\n\n3. A continuing weakness of biocatalysis as a problem solution is the small number of wellcharacterized enzymes in comparison with chemical catalysts.

Rational protein design, the first wave, was developed a few years after the discovery of recombinant DNA technology and flourished in the decade after about 1985. Applying sitedirected protein engineering, the community expected to design enzymes with predictable properties (this expectation turned out to be way premature). Even then, site saturation was part of the repertoire, which intellectually can already be attributed to 2. combinatorial protein engineering, the second wave and often also called directed evolution, with its peak between around 1995-2005. Two techniques dominate combinatorial protein design, random mutagenesis and recombination. Random mutagenesis most often operates with a high error rate of DNA duplication and thus introduces mistakes that lead to mutations anywhere in the gene sequence. Recombination digests the DNA into small pieces that are recombined in random fashion; appropriately, its most important protocol is called DNA shuffling. Combinatorial protein engineering is able to access a vastly wider sequence space than rational design but requires increasingly large libraries of mutants, with still low and uncertain chances of a successful outcome, owing to the vast sequence space of proteins.

Not only were various substituted styrenes cleaved but also cyclic alkenes, such as indene or 1,2dihydronaphthalene (69). Mechanic investigations reveal that the new biocatalyst follows neither the standard dioxygenase nor the monooxygenase mechanism.

Novel protein engineering tools have significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development (see above for descriptions of experimental and computational tools). 2. The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses, far more so than other kinds of catalysts, can be described quantitatively via rational models. Although protein stabilization commonly occurs in an incremental fashion as a function of amino acid sequence, there are now several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. Last but not least, the concept that stabilization against one type of stress, often thermoinstability, commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress, such as organic solvents, air-water or solid-water interfaces, or cavitation as a consequence of pumping or ultrasonication, is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. 3.

Although biocatalysts are often highly active and extremely selective, there are still drawbacks associated with biocatalysis as a generally applicable technique: the lack of designability of biocatalysts; their limits of stability; and the insufficient number of well-characterized, ready-to-use biocatalysts.\n\nThere has been significant progress on the following fronts: (a) novel protein engineering tools, both experimental and computational, have significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development. (b) The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses can be described quantitatively via rational models. There are several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. The concept that stabilization against one type of stress commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. (c) A host of developments of novel biocatalysts in the past few years, in part fueled by improved designability and improved methods of stabilization, has considerably broadened the toolbox for synthetic chemistry."

Here, biocatalysts are understood to comprise any protein of a length that allows three-dimensional folding, known from statistical mechanics to start at approximately 20 amino acids in length. Therefore, RNA catalysts, cofactor-only catalysts, and other organocatalysts are not covered by this review.\n\nThe rapid spread of biocatalytic routes and targets in the past few years has been aided by advances in protein engineering as well as the increasing importance of both short, selective routes to pharmaceuticals and the synthesis of chemicals from renewables. Most of these syntheses are based on the processing of carbohydrates, lignocellulosics, and vegetable oils, rather than coal, oil, or natural gas. Several eminent reviews of the field have been published; as examples, the reader is referred to works by Turner (1), Bornscheuer et al. (2), and Reetz (3)."

            "text": "Proteins are a class of macromolecules consisting of one or more folded amino acid chains of overall three-dimensional structure. Proteins consist of one or more linear chains of, with rare exceptions, the common 20 proteinogenic amino acids. The fairly frequent disulfide bonds between cysteines are formed through crosslinking of side-chain interactions but do not constitute branching of the backbone chain. Extremely rarely, an additional genetically coded twenty-first amino acid is found, such as selenocysteine in formate dehydrogenase or glutathione peroxidase (4,5), or pyrrolysine, the twenty-second amino acid, in methanogens (belonging to the domain of Archaea) (6,7). This review does not cover the body of excellent work performed to incorporate nonproteinogenic and often even unnatural amino acids into proteins [for reviews, see Ngo & Tirrell (8) and Xiao et al.

Monomers of enzymes typically consist of 147 (bovine lysozyme) to 667 (alcohol oxidase from Aspergillus or Pichia) amino acid residues, most of them clustering between 280 and 400 residues. Protein sequences are searchable with a variety of algorithm-based tools, such as BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), ClustalW (http://www.clustal.org), or FASTA (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml), in a variety of databases, such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://"

Operation at near ambient conditions promises energy efficiency of biocatalytic processes. Typical renewable raw materials, such as carbohydrates or fatty acids, are more hydrophilic than raw materials obtained from petrochemicals, which tend to be hydrocarbons. Such hydrophilic raw materials are advantageously processed in aqueous solvents, so biocatalysis is a good technological fit for renewable raw materials."

This review focuses on three:\n\n1. The development of biocatalysts is prone to chance and slow, and does not follow a set of rules. The development of enzymes from nature and improvement through random mutagenesis are perceived this way. 2. A decisive weakness of biocatalysts is their very limited range of stability with respect to temperature, solvents, pH value, ionic strength, and salt type.\n\n3. A continuing weakness of biocatalysis as a problem solution is the small number of wellcharacterized enzymes in comparison with chemical catalysts. In addition, not many are commercially available and thus hinder the diffusion of this technology. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org.

            "text": "The arguably most important reason for the progress of biocatalysis over the past decade is the advance of protein engineering. Progress can be divided into three waves:\n\n1. Rational protein design, the first wave, was developed a few years after the discovery of recombinant DNA technology and flourished in the decade after about 1985. Applying sitedirected protein engineering, the community expected to design enzymes with predictable properties (this expectation turned out to be way premature). Even then, site saturation was part of the repertoire, which intellectually can already be attributed to 2. combinatorial protein engineering, the second wave and often also called directed evolution, with its peak between around 1995-2005. Two techniques dominate combinatorial protein design, random mutagenesis and recombination. Random mutagenesis most often operates with a high error rate of DNA duplication and thus introduces mistakes that lead to mutations anywhere in the gene sequence. Recombination digests the DNA into small pieces that are recombined in random fashion; appropriately, its most important protocol is called DNA shuffling. Combinatorial protein engineering is able to access a vastly wider sequence space than rational design but requires increasingly large libraries of mutants, with still low and uncertain chances of a successful outcome, owing to the vast sequence space of proteins.

Instead, an efficiency function E f has been proposed, which scales the catalytic constant k cat to the product of the second-order rate constant of diffusion k diff [≈3.2•10 9 (M•s -1 ) in water at 25 • C] and a relevant concentration, here the term K M + [S] (37).

Through follow-up of an observation that cyano-and thiobacteria from Synechococcus and Paracoccus species, respectively, furnished either (R)-or (S)-secondary alcohols from the corresponding racemic sulfate esters in an enantiocomplementary fashion, Kurt Faber's group at the University of Graz (Austria) found broad-spectrum inverting alkylsulfatases, for which no complement in chemistry exists (64). Medium engineering dramatically improved enantioselectivity: addition of lower alcohols or use of methyl tert-butyl ether in a biphasic system improved the E value from approximately 4 to >200. Inverting alkylsulfatases, which belong to the family of metallo-β-lactamases and feature a conserved binuclear Zn 2+ cluster in their active site, catalyze the enantioselective hydrolysis of sec-alkylsulfates with strict inversion of configuration, yielding homochiral (S)-configurated alcohols and nonreacted (S)-configurated sulfate esters.

Ninety-six-well plates specially adapted for oxygen pressure revealed successful conversion of a broad range of aromatic alkenes to the respective aldehydes or ketones, with excellent chemoselectivity, i.e., no overreaction to carboxylic acids (Figure 7). Not only were various substituted styrenes cleaved but also cyclic alkenes, such as indene or 1,2dihydronaphthalene (69). Mechanic investigations reveal that the new biocatalyst follows neither the standard dioxygenase nor the monooxygenase mechanism. It instead seems to prefer a mechanism akin to a 2 + 2 cycloaddition, as two oxygen atoms derived from two different molecules of dioxygen are incorporated into the carbonyl products (Figure 8) (70).

This second-generation process, still practiced today, led to increased yield of 45% based on racemate (without recycle) and decreased solvent use such that the E factor [unit mass of waste (not water)/unit mass of API] was reduced from 86 to 17. Very recently, the ene reductase-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of 3-cyano-5-methylhex-2-enoic acid (ethyl ester) to (S)-3-cyano-5-methylhexanoic acid (ethyl ester) was tested (105,106)."

The nonproteinogenic amino acid is a key intermediate required for the synthesis of Saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor under development for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Figure 15). E. coli coexpressing PheDH and FDH from P. pastoris for cofactor regeneration allowed the successful reductive amination of the ketoacid on several kilogram scale (40 kg in 800-liter vessel and 99% conversion) (107)."

As the wild-type enzyme showed no activity toward ketositagliptin, a truncated substrate, a 3-keto-butyrpiperazine, was employed to overcome the lack of activity on their target substrate. Wild-type transaminase had low but detectable activity of 4% conversion in 24 h toward 3-keto-butyrpiperazine. Transition Reductive amination to (S)-3-hydroxyadamantylglycine, a precursor to Saxagliptin, using a PheDH/FDH system. Reproduced from Reference 109, copyright 2011 ACS. state docking of variants of the binding pocket of the truncated substrate yielded an enzyme with very low activity of <1% over 24 h, but again above background. After several rounds of random and targeted mutagenesis, employing restricted codon usage and ProSAR, an enzyme with much higher conversion and sufficient stability in the reaction medium 60:40 water:DMSO was developed. Ultimately, the final variant contains 27 mutations around the active-site and at the dimer interface. The enzymatic process, certified by the Federal Drug Administration in 2012, resulted in 3-5% points higher yield over the first-generation chemical process and one-third less solvent waste."

            "text": "There is consensus in the community that biocatalysts are competitive or even superb in terms of activity and selectivity at near-ambient conditions. In the past, three points have often been raised to question the overall role of biocatalysis in catalytic processing: the lack of designability of biocatalysts, their limits of stability, and the insufficient number of well-characterized, readyto-use biocatalysts.\n\nProgress on all three fronts, outlined in the preceding section of this review, is very encouraging.\n\n1. Novel protein engineering tools have significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development (see above for descriptions of experimental and computational tools). 2. The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses, far more so than other kinds of catalysts, can be described quantitatively via rational models. Although protein stabilization commonly occurs in an incremental fashion as a function of amino acid sequence, there are now several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. Last but not least, the concept that stabilization against one type of stress, often thermoinstability, commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress, such as organic solvents, air-water or solid-water interfaces, or cavitation as a consequence of pumping or ultrasonication, is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. 3. A host of developments of novel biocatalysts "

Traditionally, enzymes were isolated from their respective sources, these being microorganisms, fungi, insects, plants, or mammalian species. However, this was often tedious, and in many cases reasonable amounts were not accessible. This long-standing limitation constituted one of the major obstacles to generalizing biocatalysis in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology. The breakthrough, catalyzed by the work of Paul Berg, Herbert Boyer, and Stanley Cohen, came with the development of recombinant DNA methododology, according to which a given enzyme occurring in one organism can be overexpressed in another host organism. 12 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are typical host organisms.\n\nIn this way large quantities of enzymes became accessible, sometimes in ton amounts, an example being protein-based detergents produced by such companies as Henkel (Germany) or Novozyme (Denmark). In some cases enzymes cannot be expressed in the usual bacterial hosts, therefore requiring the development of alternative expression systems. 2 Biotechnological engineering of reactors, enzyme immobilization, and methods for the optimization of downstream workup contributed heavily to making biocatalysis practical and industrially viable. 2,13 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis in 1983 r"

Liese, K. Seelbach, and C. Wandrey illustrates numerous industrial applications of enzymes up to 2006 by including informative reaction flow-sheets and the applied reactor technology. 13a Other reviews likewise dispel myths regarding biocatalysis. 13b-g One of numerous examples is the BASF process for the production of chiral amines in enantiomerically pure form. 15 Racemic amines such as rac-11 are acylated with methoxyacetic acid ethyl ester (12), an appropriate lipase serving as the catalyst in kinetic resolutions characterized by very high selectivity factors (E > 200), depending upon the particular structure of the starting amine. 15 More recently a system for performing dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral amines using a racemizing Ru catalyst in combination with a lipase was developed by Backvall et al. which has the important advantage of enabling full conversion and high enantioselectivity, 16a similar to the prior development of dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols and diols. 16b,c The advantages of dynamic ki"

Site-specific mutagenesis for improving stereoselectivity, a more challenging task, was shown to be successful in some cases, 19,20c,d but due to the complexity of enzymes, generalization has not been accomplished to date. Some researchers in the 1980s generated libraries of mutants using mutating chemical agents, mutator strains, or even genetic methods and screened these for enhanced thermostability or activity. 21 However, a second mutagenesis/screening cycle, which would have exerted \"evolutionary pressure\", was not considered (with one exception). 21d In the mid-1980s the first examples of catalytic antibodies were published independently by Richard Lerner and Peter Schultz, which sparked a flurry of activities toward a possible alternative to enzymes. 22 Many fascinating studies of a variety of reacti"

          "text": "Today all of the problems listed in section 4 can be addressed by applying a different protein engineering technique called directed evolution (or laboratory evolution). 19,23 It involves repeating cycles of gene mutagenesis, expression, and screening (or selection) of mutant enzyme libraries in an overall process which simulates natural evolution. The most common gene mutagenesis methods for generating mutant libraries are\n\n• error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR)\n\n• saturation mutagenesis • DNA shuffling Since epPCR targets the whole gene and therefore the entire protein, it is a kind of shotgun method, although amino acid bias exists. 19,24a It is the most often used technique and does not require structural information about the enzyme. In a seminal study published by Frances Arnold in 1993, several rounds of epPCR were applied in order to increase the robustness of the protease subtilisin E toward the hostile solvent dimethylformamide. 24b Later this approach was extended by many groups to include the enhancement of thermostability using epPCR and other genetic techniques. 19,25 As synthetic organic chemists, my group became interested in laboratory evolution back in 1995 because we wanted to control a catalytic parameter which is at the heart of modern organic synthesis, namely stereoselectivity. As schematized in Figure 1, it is a logical strategy for generating enzyme mutants as catalysts in asymmetric transformations. 26 Each cycle exerts evolutionary pressure"

To this day screening is the bottleneck of directed evolution. 19,23,27 Unfortunately, few studies focus on systematic comparisons, which means that it often not clear which mutagenesis strategy is in fact optimal. 37 In an early example concerning the transformation of a β-galactosidase into a β-fucosidase, Matsumura et al. demonstrated that saturation mutagenesis is more efficient than DNA shuffling, but the authors were careful not to generalize. 37a In the case of the lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of rac-16 (section 6), the best strategy available in 2001 utilized mainly epPCR and DNA shuffling, 26c but a subsequent QM/MM study predicted that of the six point mutations of the best mutant showing E = 51, four are superfluous. 38 Indeed, the double mutant was generated and shown to be even more selective (E = 63). While this was a triumph of theory, it indicated inefficiency of the mutagenesis procedure which had been applied. Extensive deconvolution of all point mutations of a variant in a given enzyme system is necessary to uncover any superfluous mutations, but this is rarely done. 23a Efficacy would not be so crucial if selection instead of screening systems could be used in a general way in which the host organism experiences a growth advantage because it houses improved mutant enzy"

The breakthrough, catalyzed by the work of Paul Berg, Herbert Boyer, and Stanley Cohen, came with the development of recombinant DNA methododology, according to which a given enzyme occurring in one organism can be overexpressed in another host organism. 12 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are typical host organisms.\n\nIn this way large quantities of enzymes became accessible, sometimes in ton amounts, an example being protein-based detergents produced by such companies as Henkel (Germany) or Novozyme (Denmark). In some cases enzymes cannot be expressed in the usual bacterial hosts, therefore requiring the development of alternative expression systems. 2 Biotechnological engineering of reactors, enzyme immobilization, and methods for the optimization of downstream workup contributed heavily to making biocatalysis practical and industrially viable. 2,13 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis in 1983 r"

Liese, K. Seelbach, and C.

Rational design based on sitespecific mutagenesis, a genetic method introduced in 1978 by Michael Smith for replacing a given amino acid in a protein by one of the other 19 canonical representatives, 18 paved the way for manipulating the structure and catalytic properties of enzymes. 19 Rational design proved to be (partially) successful in studies aimed at enhancing the thermostability of proteins. 19,20a,b Amino acid substitutions were designed which led to new intramolecular H-bonds on the protein surface, thereby helping to prevent undesired unfolding upon heat treatment. Site-specific mutagenesis for improving stereoselectivity, a more challenging task, was shown to be successful in some cases, 19,20c,d but due to the complexity of enzymes, generalization has not been accomplished to date. Some researchers in the 1980s generated libraries of mutants using mutating chemical agents, mutator strains, or even genetic methods and screened these for enhanced thermostability or activity. 21 However, a second mutagenesis/screening cycle, which would have exerted \"evolutionary pressure\", was not considered (with one exception). 21d In the mid-1980s the first examples of catalytic antibodies were published independently by Richard Lerner and Peter Schultz, which sparked a flurry of activities toward a possible alternative to enzymes. 22 Many fascinating studies of a variety of reacti"

            "text": "Today all of the problems listed in section 4 can be addressed by applying a different protein engineering technique called directed evolution (or laboratory evolution). 19,23 It involves repeating cycles of gene mutagenesis, expression, and screening (or selection) of mutant enzyme libraries in an overall process which simulates natural evolution. The most common gene mutagenesis methods for generating mutant libraries are\n\n• error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR)\n\n• saturation mutagenesis • DNA shuffling Since epPCR targets the whole gene and therefore the entire protein, it is a kind of shotgun method, although amino acid bias exists. 19,24a It is the most often used technique and does not require structural information about the enzyme. In a seminal study published by Frances Arnold in 1993, several rounds of epPCR were applied in order to increase the robustness of the protease subtilisin E toward the hostile solvent dimethylformamide. 24b Later this approach was extended by many groups to include the enhancement of thermostability using epPCR and other genetic techniques. 19,25 As synthetic organic chemists, my group became interested in laboratory evolution back in 1995 because we wanted to control a catalytic parameter which is at the heart of modern organic synthesis, namely stereoselectivity. As schematized in Figure 1, it is a logical strategy for generating enzyme mutants as catalysts in asymmetric transformations. 26 Each cycle exerts evolutionary pressure"

To this day screening is the bottleneck of directed evolution. 19,23,27 Unfortunately, few studies focus on systematic comparisons, which means that it often not clear which mutagenesis strategy is in fact optimal. 37 In an early example concerning the transformation of a β-galactosidase into a β-fucosidase, Matsumura et al. demonstrated that saturation mutagenesis is more efficient than DNA shuffling, but the authors were careful not to generalize. 37a In the case of the lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of rac-16 (section 6), the best strategy available in 2001 utilized mainly epPCR and DNA shuffling, 26c but a subsequent QM/MM study predicted that of the six point mutations of the best mutant showing E = 51, four are superfluous. 38 Indeed, the double mutant was generated and shown to be even more selective (E = 63). While this was a triumph of theory, it indicated inefficiency of the mutagenesis procedure which had been applied. Extensive deconvolution of all point mutations of a variant in a given enzyme system is necessary to uncover any superfluous mutations, but this is rarely done. 23a Efficacy would not be so crucial if selection instead of screening systems could be used in a general way in which the host organism experiences a growth advantage because it houses improved mutant enzy"

Enzymatic processes are conducted under mild conditions (close to ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure and physiological pH) in water, with high rates and selectivities. Furthermore, the use of enzymes generally obviates the need for functional group protection and/or activation, affording synthetic routes that are more step economic, generate less waste and are more energy efficient than conventional organic syntheses. In short, enzymatic processes are more environmentally friendly, more cost-effective and, ultimately, more sustainable. Consequently, in the last two decades biocatalysis has emerged as an important technology for meeting the growing demand for green and sustainable chemicals manufacture, 1,2 particularly in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, flavour and fragrances, vitamins and other fine chemicals. 3,4 Thanks to advances in biotechnology and protein engineering it is now possible to produce most enzymes for commercially acceptable prices and to manipulate them such that they exhibit the desired properties with regard to, inter alia, substrate specificity, activity, selectivity, stability and pH optimum. 5,6 Notwithstanding all these advantages, industrial application of enzymes is often hampered by a lack of long-term operational stability and difficult recovery and re-use of the enzyme.

Ionic binding is generally stronger and covalent binding of the enzyme to the support would generally prevent the enzyme from leaching from the surface. On the other hand, covalent bonding to the enzyme has the disadvantage that if the enzyme is irreversibly deactivated, both the enzyme and the (often costly) support are rendered unusable. Typical supports for enzyme immobilisation are synthetic resins, biopolymers, such as polysaccharides, or inorganic solids such as (mesoporous) silicas or zeolites.\n\n(ii) Entrapment via inclusion of an enzyme in a polymer network, typically organic or inorganic polymer matrices, such as polyacrylamide and silica sol-gel, respectively, or a membrane device such as a hollow fiber or a microcapsule. The physical restraints generally are too weak, however, to prevent enzyme leakage entirely. Hence, additional covalent attachment is often required.

The three terms most often used to determine the success of enzyme immobilisation are the immobilisation yield, the immobilisation efficiency and the activity recovery. The immobilisation yield should be used to describe the percentage of total enzyme activity from the free enzyme solution that is immobilised: Yield (%) = 100 Â (immobilised activity/starting activity)\n\nThe ''activity that is immobilised'' can only be correctly determined by measuring the total residual enzyme activity that remains in the enzyme solution after immobilisation and by subtracting this activity from the total starting activity. In some cases a parallel blank experiment should be carried out to compensate for free enzyme deactivation under the immobilisation conditions. Sometimes protein measurements are used to determine the immobilisation yield. This could be misleading, especially when a crude protein mixture is used for immobilisation, as the different proteins can have different immobilisation yields. It can however be useful to monitor both enzyme activity and protein concentration in the supernatant, to rule out any deactivation of the free enzyme and to determine the protein and/or enzyme loading (wt%) of the immobilised biocatalyst.\n\nThe second term often used to describe the success of immobilisation is the immobilisation efficiency.

For example, the widely used enzyme C. antarctica lipase B, (CaLB), 15 is commercially available in immobilised form as Novozym 435 which consists of the enzyme adsorbed on a macroporous acrylic resin. A disadvantage of immobilisation in this way is that, because it is not covalently bound, the enzyme can be leached from the support in an aqueous medium or in the presence of substrates and/or products with surfactant-like properties.\n\nIn order to suppress leaching, covalent attachment to surface-functionalised acrylic resins, such as Eupergit s C, a macroporous copolymer of N,N 0 -methylene-bi-(methacrylamide), glycidyl methacrylate, allyl glycidyl ether and methacrylamide, is widely used for immobilisation of enzymes. 16 Eupergit C is highly hydrophilic and stable, both chemically and mechanically, over a pH-range from 0 to 14, and does not swell or shrink even upon drastic pH changes in this range. The average particle size is 170 mm and the pore diameter is 25 nm.

One of the simplest and most inexpensive methods to immobilise an enzyme is by silica granulation. 15 It is used in detergent formulations which release the enzyme into the washing liquid during washing. Granulation technology was used to immobilise CaLB lipase on silica granules, by first adsorbing the lipase on silica powder followed by agglomeration. 15 Granulates are only suitable for use in organic media. In an aqueous medium the lipase is desorbed and the particle slowly disintegrates. However, the CaLB silica granules can be used in a direct ester synthesis if the water is removed by e.g. evaporation under vacuum. Applying the granules in packed bed reactors also minimises the contact time with high water concentrations. The CaLB silica granules exhibited a similar activity to Novozyme 435 in the direct synthesis of the skin emollient, isopropyl myristate. In order to maintain stability in an aqueous environment the enzyme needs to be covalently attached to a functionalised silica support.\n\nMesoporous silicas, nowadays often referred to as nanosilicas, have several advantages as supports. They have uniform pore diameters (2-40 nm), very high surface areas (300-1500 m 2 g À1 ) and pore volumes (ca. 1 ml g À1 ), and are inert and stable at elevated temperatures.

PCMCs are prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of the enzyme with a concentrated solution of a salt such as potassium sulphate, an amino acid or a sugar. The resulting solution is added dropwise with vigorous mixing to a water-miscible solvent such as isopropanol, whereupon micron-sized crystals, containing the enzyme on the surface, are formed. A major advantage of the technique is that the enzyme molecules are dehydrated by a mechanism that leaves the majority of the enzymes in an active conformation and minimises denaturation. The PCMCs can be separated and stored or used as a suspension in an organic solvent. Obviously in an aqueous medium they dissolve to liberate the free enzyme. In a transesterification of N-acetyl tyrosine ethyl ester with isopropanol (Fig. 4) PCMCs of subtilisin Carlsberg (EC 3.4.21.62) exhibited an activity three orders of magnitude higher than that of the lyophilised powder. 28 Fig. 3 Tanabe aminoacylase process using a packed bed of biocatalyst.

          "text": "A novel approach to immobilisation of enzymes is via covalent attachment to stimulus-responsive or 'smart polymers' which undergo dramatic conformational changes in response to small changes in their environment, e.g. temperature, pH and ionic strength. 29 The most well-known example is the thermoresponsive and biocompatible polymer, poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (polyNIPAM). Aqueous solutions of polyNIPAM exhibit a critical solution temperature (LCST) around 32 1C, below which the polymer readily dissolves in water while, above the LCST it becomes insoluble owing to expulsion of water molecules from the polymer network. Hence, the biotransformation can be performed under conditions where the enzyme is soluble, thereby minimising diffusional limitations and loss of activity owing to protein conformational changes on the surface of a support. Subsequently, raising the temperature above the LCST leads to precipitation of the immobilised enzyme, thus facilitating its recovery and reuse. An additional advantage is that runaway conditions are avoided because when the reaction temperature exceeds the LCST the catalyst precipitates and the reaction shuts down.\n\nTwo methods are generally used to prepare the enzyme-polyNIPAM conjugates: (i) introduction of polymerisable vinyl groups into the enzyme followed by copolymerisation with NIPAM or (ii) reaction of NH 2 groups on the surface of the enzyme with a copolymer of NIPAM containing reactive ester groups (Fig. 5) or the homopolymer cont"

For good filterability the particles should be relatively large but increasing the particle size can result in loss of activity owing to diffusion limitations, i.e. slow diffusion of the substrate through the large particles. This means that in practice a compromise has to be made where the particles are large enough to facilitate filtration or centrifugation but not too large that diffusion limitations become an issue. This is even more so in the production of larger volume products where processes are often conducted in continuous operation over a packed bed of (bio)catalyst. In this case it is important to have relatively large particles in order to avoid a pressure drop over the column. Here again, a compromise has to be struck to avoid the pressure drop without decreasing activity as a result of diffusion limitations. In contrast, very small (micron-or even nano-size) particles can be successfully used in a so-called fluidised bed, whereby the liquid feed is passed through the bed of solid catalyst at high enough velocities to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid. The particles should be small but relatively dense to avoid them being blown out of the column.\n\nAlternatively, enzymes can be immobilised by attaching them to functionalised magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) which can be separated from the reaction mixture by magnetic decantation o"

The morphologies of the silica sol-gels depend on the method of drying. 32 Drying by evaporation affords so-called xerogels in which capillary stress causes a shrinkage of the nano cages and pores. When alkyl siloxanes, RSi(OR) 3 are used together with Si(OR) 4 the surface of the sol-gel is more densely populated by the hydrophobic alkyl groups and the capillary stresses which operate during evaporation are largely attenuated, affording a so-called ambigel in which there is no contraction of the nano cages. Alternatively, drying with supercritical carbon dioxide affords so-called aerogels in which the delicate pore structure and accompanying high porosity is maintained.\n\nEntrapment of lipases in sol-gels derived from Si(OEt) 4 afforded immobilisates with disappointingly low activities in the esterification of lauric acid by 1-octanol. 33 In contrast, entrapment in a sol-gel prepared from a mixture of Si(OMe) 4 and RSi(OMe) 3 afforded a more hydrophobic matrix exhibiting rate enhancements of 2-8 fold compared with the corresponding lyophilised powder. This method has been widely used for the immobilisation of enzymes. 34,35 An interesting elaboration involves the addition of porous supports such as Celite during the sol-gel process to bind the lipase-containing gels.

In principle free enzymes can also be entrapped in Lentikats by mixing them directly with the liquid precursor of the Lentikat. Unfortunately the dimensions of most enzymes are not large enough to prevent them leaching from the hydrogel network in an aqueous environment. In order to prevent this the reaction should be performed in non-aqueous media or the size of the enzyme should be increased, e.g. by cross-linking. For example, Gro ¨ger and coworkers 40 entrapped an (R)-hydroxynitrile lyase in a Lentikat PVA hydrogel by crosslinking it using a mixture of glutaraldehyde and chitosan (Fig. 7). The resulting immobilised biocatalyst had a well-defined particle size of 3-5 mm and showed no leaching during the enantioselective hydrocyanation of benzaldehyde in a biphasic aqueous buffer-organic solvent system.

However, this methodology had several drawbacks: low activity retention, poor reproducibility, low mechanical stability, and difficulties in handling the gelatinous CLEs. Mechanical stability and ease of handling could be improved by cross-linking the enzyme in a gel matrix or on a carrier but this led to a disadvantageous dilution of activity. Consequently, in the late 1960s, emphasis switched to carrier-bound enzymes, which became the most widely used methodology for enzyme immobilisation for the following three decades."

CLECs are significantly more stable to denaturation by heat, organic solvents and proteolysis than the corresponding soluble enzyme or lyophilised powder. Their operational stability and ease of recycling, coupled with their high catalyst and volumetric productivities, renders them ideally suited for industrial biotransformations. However, an inherent drawback of CLECs is the need to crystallise the enzyme, an often laborious procedure requiring enzyme of high purity. In practice this translates to prohibitively high costs for many applications. To our knowledge CLECs are no longer commercially available and have now been superseded by the closely related CLEAs (see next section)."

The addition of salts, or water miscible organic solvents or non-ionic polymers, to aqueous solutions of proteins leads to their precipitation as physical aggregates of protein molecules, held together by non-covalent bonding without perturbation of their tertiary structure, that is without denaturation. Subsequent cross-linking of these physical aggregates renders them permanently insoluble while maintaining their pre-organised superstructure, and, hence their catalytic activity. This led to the development of a new technology for immobilising enzymes as so-called cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA s ) (Fig. 8). Since precipitation from an aqueous medium, by addition of ammonium sulfate or polyethylene glycol, is often used to purify enzymes, the CLEA methodology essentially combines purification and immobilisation into a single unit operation that does not require a highly pure enzyme. It can be used, for example, for the direct immobilisation of an enzyme from a crude fermentation broth.\n\nThe CLEA can be modified by performing the cross-linking in the presence of a monomer that undergoes (co)polymerisation under these conditions. This affords CLEA-polymer composites with tunable physical properties. For example, if the cross-linking is performed in the presence of a siloxane, e.g. Si(OMe) 4 or RSi(OMe) 3 , the latter undergoes simultaneous polymerisation to afford a CLEA-silica composite. 13 "

Enzymatic processes are conducted under mild conditions (close to ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure and physiological pH) in water, with high rates and selectivities. Furthermore, the use of enzymes generally obviates the need for functional group protection and/or activation, affording synthetic routes that are more step economic, generate less waste and are more energy efficient than conventional organic syntheses. In short, enzymatic processes are more environmentally friendly, more cost-effective and, ultimately, more sustainable. Consequently, in the last two decades biocatalysis has emerged as an important technology for meeting the growing demand for green and sustainable chemicals manufacture, 1,2 particularly in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, flavour and fragrances, vitamins and other fine chemicals. 3,4 Thanks to advances in biotechnology and protein engineering it is now possible to produce most enzymes for commercially acceptable prices and to manipulate them such that they exhibit the desired properties with regard to, inter alia, substrate specificity, activity, selectivity, stability and pH optimum. 5,6 Notwithstanding all these advantages, industrial application of enzymes is often hampered by a lack of long-term operational stability and difficult recovery and re-use of the enzyme.

Ionic binding is generally stronger and covalent binding of the enzyme to the support would generally prevent the enzyme from leaching from the surface. On the other hand, covalent bonding to the enzyme has the disadvantage that if the enzyme is irreversibly deactivated, both the enzyme and the (often costly) support are rendered unusable. Typical supports for enzyme immobilisation are synthetic resins, biopolymers, such as polysaccharides, or inorganic solids such as (mesoporous) silicas or zeolites.\n\n(ii) Entrapment via inclusion of an enzyme in a polymer network, typically organic or inorganic polymer matrices, such as polyacrylamide and silica sol-gel, respectively, or a membrane device such as a hollow fiber or a microcapsule. The physical restraints generally are too weak, however, to prevent enzyme leakage entirely. Hence, additional covalent attachment is often required.

The three terms most often used to determine the success of enzyme immobilisation are the immobilisation yield, the immobilisation efficiency and the activity recovery. The immobilisation yield should be used to describe the percentage of total enzyme activity from the free enzyme solution that is immobilised: Yield (%) = 100 Â (immobilised activity/starting activity)\n\nThe ''activity that is immobilised'' can only be correctly determined by measuring the total residual enzyme activity that remains in the enzyme solution after immobilisation and by subtracting this activity from the total starting activity. In some cases a parallel blank experiment should be carried out to compensate for free enzyme deactivation under the immobilisation conditions. Sometimes protein measurements are used to determine the immobilisation yield. This could be misleading, especially when a crude protein mixture is used for immobilisation, as the different proteins can have different immobilisation yields. It can however be useful to monitor both enzyme activity and protein concentration in the supernatant, to rule out any deactivation of the free enzyme and to determine the protein and/or enzyme loading (wt%) of the immobilised biocatalyst.\n\nThe second term often used to describe the success of immobilisation is the immobilisation efficiency.

A disadvantage of immobilisation in this way is that, because it is not covalently bound, the enzyme can be leached from the support in an aqueous medium or in the presence of substrates and/or products with surfactant-like properties.\n\nIn order to suppress leaching, covalent attachment to surface-functionalised acrylic resins, such as Eupergit s C, a macroporous copolymer of N,N 0 -methylene-bi-(methacrylamide), glycidyl methacrylate, allyl glycidyl ether and methacrylamide, is widely used for immobilisation of enzymes. 16 Eupergit C is highly hydrophilic and stable, both chemically and mechanically, over a pH-range from 0 to 14, and does not swell or shrink even upon drastic pH changes in this range.

One of the simplest and most inexpensive methods to immobilise an enzyme is by silica granulation. 15 It is used in detergent formulations which release the enzyme into the washing liquid during washing. Granulation technology was used to immobilise CaLB lipase on silica granules, by first adsorbing the lipase on silica powder followed by agglomeration. 15 Granulates are only suitable for use in organic media. In an aqueous medium the lipase is desorbed and the particle slowly disintegrates. However, the CaLB silica granules can be used in a direct ester synthesis if the water is removed by e.g. evaporation under vacuum. Applying the granules in packed bed reactors also minimises the contact time with high water concentrations. The CaLB silica granules exhibited a similar activity to Novozyme 435 in the direct synthesis of the skin emollient, isopropyl myristate. In order to maintain stability in an aqueous environment the enzyme needs to be covalently attached to a functionalised silica support.\n\nMesoporous silicas, nowadays often referred to as nanosilicas, have several advantages as supports.

PCMCs are prepared by mixing an aqueous solution of the enzyme with a concentrated solution of a salt such as potassium sulphate, an amino acid or a sugar. The resulting solution is added dropwise with vigorous mixing to a water-miscible solvent such as isopropanol, whereupon micron-sized crystals, containing the enzyme on the surface, are formed. A major advantage of the technique is that the enzyme molecules are dehydrated by a mechanism that leaves the majority of the enzymes in an active conformation and minimises denaturation. The PCMCs can be separated and stored or used as a suspension in an organic solvent. Obviously in an aqueous medium they dissolve to liberate the free enzyme. In a transesterification of N-acetyl tyrosine ethyl ester with isopropanol (Fig. 4) PCMCs of subtilisin Carlsberg (EC 3.4.21.62) exhibited an activity three orders of magnitude higher than that of the lyophilised powder. 28 Fig. 3 Tanabe aminoacylase process using a packed bed of biocatalyst.

Aqueous solutions of polyNIPAM exhibit a critical solution temperature (LCST) around 32 1C, below which the polymer readily dissolves in water while, above the LCST it becomes insoluble owing to expulsion of water molecules from the polymer network. Hence, the biotransformation can be performed under conditions where the enzyme is soluble, thereby minimising diffusional limitations and loss of activity owing to protein conformational changes on the surface of a support. Subsequently, raising the temperature above the LCST leads to precipitation of the immobilised enzyme, thus facilitating its recovery and reuse. An additional advantage is that runaway conditions are avoided because when the reaction temperature exceeds the LCST the catalyst precipitates and the reaction shuts down.\n\nTwo methods are generally used to prepare the enzyme-polyNIPAM conjugates: (i) introduction of polymerisable vinyl groups into the enzyme followed by copolymerisation with NIPAM or (ii) reaction of NH 2 groups on the surface of the enzyme with a copolymer of NIPAM containing reactive ester groups (Fig. 5) or the homopolymer cont"

For good filterability the particles should be relatively large but increasing the particle size can result in loss of activity owing to diffusion limitations, i.e. slow diffusion of the substrate through the large particles. This means that in practice a compromise has to be made where the particles are large enough to facilitate filtration or centrifugation but not too large that diffusion limitations become an issue. This is even more so in the production of larger volume products where processes are often conducted in continuous operation over a packed bed of (bio)catalyst. In this case it is important to have relatively large particles in order to avoid a pressure drop over the column. Here again, a compromise has to be struck to avoid the pressure drop without decreasing activity as a result of diffusion limitations. In contrast, very small (micron-or even nano-size) particles can be successfully used in a so-called fluidised bed, whereby the liquid feed is passed through the bed of solid catalyst at high enough velocities to suspend the solid and cause it to behave as though it were a fluid.

When alkyl siloxanes, RSi(OR) 3 are used together with Si(OR) 4 the surface of the sol-gel is more densely populated by the hydrophobic alkyl groups and the capillary stresses which operate during evaporation are largely attenuated, affording a so-called ambigel in which there is no contraction of the nano cages. Alternatively, drying with supercritical carbon dioxide affords so-called aerogels in which the delicate pore structure and accompanying high porosity is maintained.\n\nEntrapment of lipases in sol-gels derived from Si(OEt) 4 afforded immobilisates with disappointingly low activities in the esterification of lauric acid by 1-octanol. 33 In contrast, entrapment in a sol-gel prepared from a mixture of Si(OMe) 4 and RSi(OMe) 3 afforded a more hydrophobic matrix exhibiting rate enhancements of 2-8 fold compared with the corresponding lyophilised powder.

In principle free enzymes can also be entrapped in Lentikats by mixing them directly with the liquid precursor of the Lentikat. Unfortunately the dimensions of most enzymes are not large enough to prevent them leaching from the hydrogel network in an aqueous environment. In order to prevent this the reaction should be performed in non-aqueous media or the size of the enzyme should be increased, e.g. by cross-linking.

However, this methodology had several drawbacks: low activity retention, poor reproducibility, low mechanical stability, and difficulties in handling the gelatinous CLEs. Mechanical stability and ease of handling could be improved by cross-linking the enzyme in a gel matrix or on a carrier but this led to a disadvantageous dilution of activity.

They've provided specific body snippets and want it divided into three short paragraphs: Background, Advances, and Outlook.\n\nLooking at the body snippets, I see that enzymes are described as sustainable catalysts with advantages like biocompatibility, mild reaction conditions, and reduced waste. The text mentions three immobilisation methods: binding to support, entrapment, and cross-linking. There's also discussion about terminology inconsistencies and key metrics like immobilisation yield.\n\nI need to be careful not to include redundant information while staying within the word limit. The user emphasized clarity and non-redundancy, so I'll focus on the most critical points: why enzyme immobilisation matters (background), what methods exist with their limitations (advances), and future directions (outlook).\n\nFor structure: \n- Background should highlight enzyme advantages and why immobilisation is needed\n- Advances section will cover the three methods but concisely, noting that physical binding is weak while covalent is stronger\n- Outlook must address terminology confusion and the importance of accurate metrics like yield\n\nI notice the original text cuts off mid-sentence about covalent binding. I'll infer it's about stability under industrial conditions without adding new info. Also need to define \"activity recovery\" implicitly through context since the user wants non-redundant",

Key advances in DNA sequencing and gene synthesis are at the base of tremendous progress in tailoring biocatalysts by protein engineering and design, and the ability to reorganize enzymes into new biosynthetic pathways. To highlight these achievements, here we discuss applications of protein-engineered biocatalysts ranging from commodity chemicals to advanced pharmaceutical intermediates that use enzyme catalysis as a key step."

The US Environmental Protection Agency awards five prizes each year in the Presidential Green Chemistry Award Challenge. The nominations emphasize the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry 53 , which consider environmental factors as well as use of renewable feedstocks, energy efficiency and worker safety. Biocatalysis, using either enzyme technology or whole cells, has won 16 awards since 2000 (Table 2). Biocatalysts are made from renewable sources and are biodegradable and non-toxic, and their high selectivities simplify reaction work-ups and provide product in higher yields. Biocatalytic processes are also safe as they typically run at ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure and neutral pH. Hence, it is not surprising that so many of the awards go to biocatalysis.\n\nThe broad range of awards in Table 2 shows the application of biocatalysts beyond the pharmaceutical industry. Several applications involve polymers, especially polyesters. The optimized fermentation of lactic acid is the basis for a polylactic acid plant in Nebraska with a capacity of 141,000 tonnes per year, and a new non-natural metabolic route allows synthesis of 1,3-propanediol for the manufacture of SORONA polymer.

However, simultaneous multiple amino-acid substitutions create exponentially more variants for testing. There are 7,183,900 possibilities for two substitutions anywhere in a 200 amino-acid protein and 9,008,610,600 possibilities for three substitutions. Many of these variants are inactive, and either all are created and tested to find the improved variants, or the library is screened only partially and incremental improvements in subsequent rounds of evolution are required.\n\nThe simplest solution to this problem is more efficient screening. Changes in substrate specificity may be monitored by high-throughput methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting [55][56][57] , which can screen tens of millions of variants in a short amount of time. Whittle and Shanklin made six simultaneous substitutions in the active site of a desaturase and then screened for growth on a different substrate.

The starting point for this new activity is usually a catalytically promiscuous reaction. Catalytic promiscuity is the ability of one active site to catalyse more than one reaction type. Typically, the enzyme catalyses one normal reaction and additional side reactions, which may involve common catalytic steps. The new reaction type is not just a substituent added to the substrate, but involves a different transition state and/or forms different types of chemical bond.

However, if a second stereocentre next to the ketone carbonyl racemizes rapidly in solution and the KRED is highly selective for one configuration, then the reduction reaction can set two stereocentres in one step. Examples include a penem intermediate (8), pseudoephedrine (12) and phenylephrine (13), as well as similar processes for chiral amines (20). Also, aldolases are now being used for subsequent reaction steps to generate multiple chiral centres, for example in the synthesis of statin intermediates (33). The single-enzyme cascade reactions as catalysed by aldolases have been further expanded to multi-enzyme cascade processes, for instance in the synthesis of 29-deoxyinosine (34) in vitro or of complex molecules such as artemisinin (42) or Taxol in vivo."

            "text": "In the context of concerns about the environmental aspects of chemical manufacturing, biocatalysis provides an attractive alternative. The US Environmental Protection Agency awards five prizes each year in the Presidential Green Chemistry Award Challenge. The nominations emphasize the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry 53 , which consider environmental factors as well as use of renewable feedstocks, energy efficiency and worker safety. Biocatalysis, using either enzyme technology or whole cells, has won 16 awards since 2000 (Table 2). Biocatalysts are made from renewable sources and are biodegradable and non-toxic, and their high selectivities simplify reaction work-ups and provide product in higher yields. Biocatalytic processes are also safe as they typically run at ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure and neutral pH. Hence, it is not surprising that so many of the awards go to biocatalysis.\n\nThe broad range of awards in Table 2 shows the application of biocatalysts beyond the pharmaceutical industry. Several applications involve polymers, especially polyesters. The optimized fermentation of lactic acid is the basis for a polylactic acid plant in Nebraska with a capacity of 141,000 tonnes per year, and a new non-natural metabolic route allows synthesis of 1,3-propanediol for the manufacture of SORONA polymer. The 1,4-butanediol fermentation yields a component of another polymer, spandex. In the synthesis of polyhydroxyalkanoates, the biocatalyst catalyses not just the mo"

            "text": "Large changes in enzyme properties usually require multiple amino-acid substitutions because they make larger changes to the protein structure. However, simultaneous multiple amino-acid substitutions create exponentially more variants for testing. There are 7,183,900 possibilities for two substitutions anywhere in a 200 amino-acid protein and 9,008,610,600 possibilities for three substitutions. Many of these variants are inactive, and either all are created and tested to find the improved variants, or the library is screened only partially and incremental improvements in subsequent rounds of evolution are required.\n\nThe simplest solution to this problem is more efficient screening. Changes in substrate specificity may be monitored by high-throughput methods, such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting [55][56][57] , which can screen tens of millions of variants in a short amount of time. Whittle and Shanklin made six simultaneous substitutions in the active site of a desaturase and then screened for growth on a different substrate. Only those variants with altered substrate specificities could grow 58 . Seelig and Szostak used very large random libraries (up to 10 13 variants), from which they could select variants that catalysed an RNA ligation 59 based on binding of the product, but not the starting materials, to a column.\n\nAt present, the best approach to creating multiple mutations is to add them simultaneously but to limit the choices using statistical or bioinformatic m"

For example, directed evolution of the halohydrin dehalogenase for manufacture of the atorvastatin (Lipitor) side chain (Fig. 3) changed at least 35 of the 254 amino acids 60 (.14%) and directed evolution of the transaminase for sitagliptin manufacture (Fig. 4) changed 27 of the 330 amino acids 17 (8.2%). Similarly, computational design of a retro aldolase required 8 or 12 amino acid substitutions (4-6%) in the starting enzyme, which was a xylanase composed of 197 amino acids 72 .\n\nA second approach investigated in the past ten years is the creation of new, often non-natural, catalytic activities. The starting point for this new activity is usually a catalytically promiscuous reaction. Catalytic promiscuity is the ability of one active site to catalyse more than one reaction type. Typically, the enzyme catalyses one normal reaction and additional side reactions, which may involve common catalytic steps. The new reaction type is not just a substituent added to the substrate, but involves a different transition state and/or forms different types of chemical bond. For example, pyruvate decarboxylase normally converts pyruvate to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. However, a promiscuous catalytic activity of pyruvate decarboxylase is the coupling of this acetaldehyde to another aldehyde in an acyloin condensation. Such a non-natural pyruvate-decarboxylase-catalysed condensation of acetaldehyde with benzaldehyde is the basis for an industrial process "

Historically, enzymes from natural sources have been used to break down oils and proteins in laundry detergents, produce semisynthetic antibiotics, and create simple chiral precursors for the pharmaceutical industry. In the past 5 years, the number of available protein sequences has increased by a staggering 20-fold, accelerating the discovery of enzymes with useful activities and properties. Directed evolution, the cornerstone of our ability to tailor enzymatic properties, is allowing researchers to tailor enzymes for the synthesis of complex molecules, the modification of biological therapeutics, and the breakdown of plastic waste. Machine learning-driven proteinstructure prediction, coupled with advances in automation and high-throughput screening, is further advancing our ability to create enzymes with desired function. The ability to add nonbiological catalytic elements to enzymes means that enzyme engineers no longer have to rely solely on natural catalytic machinery. Scientists have thus gained the capacity to redesign, reimagine, and repurpose enzymes. Illustrative applications include enzyme cascades to manufacture the antivirals islatravir and molnupiravir, biocatalysts that can generate and control radicals, and enzymes that exploit photocatalysis to affect stereocontrolled C-C couplings, hydroaminations, or Diels-Alder reactions.\n\nADVANCES: The past 5 year"

Inspired by the precise control that enzymes can exert over reaction outcomes, chemists are using biocatalytic transformations that complement or even substitute for more traditional chemical routes (2).

Early uses of biocatalysis relied on accessible wildtype enzymes used in food or other industries to produce laundry detergents, semisynthetic antibiotics, and simple chiral precursors for the pharmaceutical industry (3)(4)(5). Although such repurposing still occurs occasionally, most new applications require the discovery of enzymes with distinct reactivity or the engineering of existing enzymes to catalyze the desired reaction, accept the desired substrate, and be stable and active at the desired application conditions.

Likewise, the combination of enzymes with other (catalytic) synthetic chemistry methods such as transition metal catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis (119,153,154) will be required to address humankind's challenges, such as combating climate change, degrading plastic waste, transitioning to renewable energy, and developing new therapies for medical treatment.

CO 2 -fixation pathways capable of yielding compounds through the CETCH cycle (125), and even starch synthesis from CO 2 -derived methanol (126), are further examples of complex engineered pathways.\n\nIn the fragrance industry, (-)-Ambrox, which has an ambery and woody odor, is one of the most widely used biodegradable fragrance ingredients. The previous synthesis of (-)-Ambrox (marketed as Ambrofix) was a multistep route from the diterpene sclareol isolated from clary sage. A new one-step process from biosynthetically manufactured homofarnesol uses an engineered squalene-hopene cyclase (Fig. 5) (127)(128)(129).\n\nAnother example of an enzyme cascade is a one-pot, two-enzyme reduction of allylic ketone 3-oxocyclohexene-1-carboxylate to the corresponding saturated alcohol reported in early 2023 by Bristol Myers Squibb (130) and Codexis (131). The ene reductase (ERED) and ketoreductase (KRED) process showed high enantio-and chemoselectivity. Maximum product yields benefited from the compatibility of the cofactor regeneration system and avoidance of side reactions. Separately, substrate inhibition and enzyme robustness under process con"

            "text": "Advanced tools developed in the past few years have sped up protein engineering to the point where enzymes are an equal counterpart to conventional organic synthesis catalysts, resulting in an upsurge of biocatalysis applications in pharmaceutical manufacture (152) and many other areas. Future enzyme engineering also needs to speed up discovery-design-test cycles to maintain momentum and expand synthetic contributions to new enzyme classes. Likewise, the combination of enzymes with other (catalytic) synthetic chemistry methods such as transition metal catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis (119,153,154) will be required to address humankind's challenges, such as combating climate change, degrading plastic waste, transitioning to renewable energy, and developing new therapies for medical treatment. Repurposing of enzyme mechanisms to broaden the repertoire of biocatalytic reactions represents a new concept for creating desired activities in enzyme catalysts. Other exciting strategies en route to novel enzymatic reactivities are de novo enzyme design (54) and computer \"hallucination\" (98).\n\nEleven years ago, the third wave of biocatalysis catapulted enzyme technology from \"designing a biocatalytic process around the limitations of the enzyme to engineering the enzyme to fit the specifications of the process\" (1). Now, the technology has taken yet another leap: The enzyme engineer no longer has to RESEARCH | REVIEW"

        "summary": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants me to act as a scientific editor and create a structured abstract of 200-300 words based on their provided title and body snippets. They need it in three specific paragraphs: Background, Advances, and Outlook.\n\nLooking at the materials, I see the title is \"From nature to industry: Harnessing enzymes for biocatalysis\" and there are some background snippets about how biocatalysis uses enzymes in synthetic chemistry, historical applications in laundry detergents and pharmaceuticals, and recent increases in protein sequences.

The field continues to expand its horizons, particularly as applied to the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1][2][3][4] . A useful biocatalyst (in particular, one that is suitable for application in an industrial context) is characterized by a number of features, including high catalytic turnover (>500 min -1 ), high selectivity for the particular transformation (for example, enantio-, regio-and chemoselectivity) and high process stability under the conditions that are required for the chemical transformation 5 . Biocatalysis often complements (rather than directly competes with) chemocatalysis in that it is probably best used for preparing relatively small (molecular weight < 500), enantiomerically pure chiral building blocks that are then combined with other chemically derived molecules to produce the final product. Biocatalysts have historically been widely applied in the brewing and food industries but are now finding increased application in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and even bulk chemicals. A recent and important trend is the development of new biocatalyst-based processes for the production of biofuels using renewable starting materials as an alternative to fossil fuels.

Such products range from pharmaceutical and agrochemical building blocks to fine and bulk chemicals and, more recently, components of biofuels. For a biocatalyst to be effective in an industrial process, it must be subjected to improvement and optimization, and in this respect the directed evolution of enzymes has emerged as a powerful enabling technology. Directed evolution involves repeated rounds of (i) random gene library generation, (ii) expression of genes in a suitable host and (iii) screening of libraries of variant enzymes for the property of interest.

For example, for many enzymes it may be sufficient just to target the active site residues 25 . Typically an active site of a protein will contain about 10-15 amino acid residues that make direct contact with the substrate (first coordination sphere) and a further 20-30 in the second coordination sphere. Morley et al. 26 analyzed results from their own work and from the work of other groups and concluded that in general, closer mutations are more beneficial, particularly in terms of the effect that they have on substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. Reetz et al. [27][28][29] have developed a very useful method termed iterative CASTing (combinatorial active site testing) in which active site residues are selected and organized into groups of two or three residues from which libraries can be subsequently generated. Screening of these initial libraries is undertaken, the hits from these libraries are combined, and new libraries are generated and are further screened in an iterative fashion. Clearly either a crystal structure or homology model is required for CASTing to be applied. Another approach to reduce the screening effort "

          "text": "A powerful theme that has recently emerged and that is highly relevant to directed evolution of enzymes is that of promiscuous activities [32][33][34] . Enzyme promiscuity refers to situations where an enzyme is able to catalyze a reaction that is quite distinct from its natural function but for which there are links between the two chemical transformations at the mechanistic rather than structural level. In order to try to understand the relationship between promiscuity and evolution of function, both Tawfik and Arnold have recently introduced the concept of neutral drift [35][36][37][38][39] . Neutral drift is the gradual accumulation of mutations under selection to maintain a protein's original function and structure. Such drifts have been demonstrated experimentally in the laboratories of Arnold and Tawfik by generating libraries and then screening for the original function rather than a new function. For example, Gupta et al. 38 studied the neutral drift of serum paraoxonase (PON1) and found that almost half of the 311 neutral variants that were characterized exhibited substantial changes in promiscuous activity. Similar changes in promiscuous activities were found by Bloom et al. 39 with P450 BM3 neutral variants.\n\nIt is generally thought that the earliest forms of enzymes had broad substrate specificity or reaction ambiguity and subsequently diverged and became more reaction-specific to give today's modern enzymes. Such enzyme superfamilies are exemplified by the enola"

In the past ten years, much effort and ingenuity have gone into the development of a broad range of screening and selection methods, including those based on ribosome display and mRNA display, to allow the identification of variants that have the desired characteristics.

The aim of this case study is to highlight some of the key strategies involved in an enzyme evolution program and also to present an analysis of the learning process. We set out to develop a platform biocatalytic technology for the preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines, which are an important class of chiral building block, particularly for the synthesis of biologically active pharmaceutical drugs (Fig. 4). Despite their importance, relatively few biocatalytic methods have been developed for their preparation, and existing methods rely principally on either the kinetic resolution of racemates using hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases and acylases or the more recent development of the use of transaminases for the conversion of ketones to chiral amines (Fig. 5). A conceptually different approach to preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines relies on deracemization of a racemic starting amine to provide either enantiomer in high optical purity. The deracemization process requires the combination of an enantioselective amine oxidase enzyme (conversion of amine to imine) together with a nonselective chemical reducing agent (reduction of imine to amine). Repeated cycles of enantioselective oxidation coupled with nonselective reduction result in accumulation of either the (R)-or (S)-amine enantiomer, depending on the stereopreference of the oxidase enzyme.\n\nPrior"

Variants were simply selected on the basis of their ability to catalyze oxidation of a particular amine substrate. However, recently the three-dimensional structure of the D5 mutant of MAO-N from A. niger was solved, at a resolution of 1.8 Å, offering the prospect of shedding light on the nature of the mutations and how they might affect substrate specificity 70 . The protein crystallized with a molecule of the inhibitor L-proline at the active site, thus allowing the position of the amine substrates to be estimated. Figure 6 shows the structure with four of the five key mutations found in the D5 variant mapped onto the sequence, and it is clear that these mutations are clustered close to the active site of the protein. Examination of the structure in more detail reveals the presence of two channels, labeled A and B, that pass from the surface of the protein and that intersect at the active site. The mutations at positions 336, 384 and 385 are located within channel A on loops, r e v i e w whereas the mutation at position 246 is located within channel B. None of the 4 residues makes direct contact with the substrate; rather, they are located within the second coordination sphere. These results are interpreted as implying that the mutations at positions 336, 384, 385 and 242 in some way affect the dynamics of the two channels and hence have an effect on access of the s"

In many cases, particularly for industrial applications, the overall aim of all of these projects is to develop robust and highly selective biocatalysts for applications in synthetic organic chemistry. The chiral 1,3-diol-containing side chain of the cholesterol-lowering statin drugs (for example, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) has been a major target for biocatalysis, thus leading to the development of a number of different industrial processes that use one or more biocatalysts in the key step. One of the most elegant approaches developed involves the use of deoxyribose aldolase (DERA) to catalyze the combination of two molecules of acetaldehyde and one molecule of chloroacetaldehyde to give a product with two asymmetric centers 71 . Both carbon-carbon bonds are formed with very high levels of enantioand diastereoselectivity (Fig. 3). The wild-type enzyme was found to be inhibited by the chloroacetaldehyde and hence was subjected to rounds of directed evolution to improve its process stability. Other groups have evolved aldolases 72,73 with altered reaction stereochemistry, including a particularly impressive example by Williams et al. 74 with N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase.

The field continues to expand its horizons, particularly as applied to the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals [1][2][3][4] . A useful biocatalyst (in particular, one that is suitable for application in an industrial context) is characterized by a number of features, including high catalytic turnover (>500 min -1 ), high selectivity for the particular transformation (for example, enantio-, regio-and chemoselectivity) and high process stability under the conditions that are required for the chemical transformation 5 . Biocatalysis often complements (rather than directly competes with) chemocatalysis in that it is probably best used for preparing relatively small (molecular weight < 500), enantiomerically pure chiral building blocks that are then combined with other chemically derived molecules to produce the final product. Biocatalysts have historically been widely applied in the brewing and food industries but are now finding increased application in the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and even bulk chemicals. A recent and important trend is the development of new biocatalyst-based processes for the production of biofuels using renewable starting materials as an alternative to fossil fuels. In this sense biocatalysis should be viewed as an e"

Such products range from pharmaceutical and agrochemical building blocks to fine and bulk chemicals and, more recently, components of biofuels. For a biocatalyst to be effective in an industrial process, it must be subjected to improvement and optimization, and in this respect the directed evolution of enzymes has emerged as a powerful enabling technology. Directed evolution involves repeated rounds of (i) random gene library generation, (ii) expression of genes in a suitable host and (iii) screening of libraries of variant enzymes for the property of interest. Both in vitro screening-based methods and in vivo selection-based methods have been applied to the evolution of enzyme function and properties.

            "text": "As a consequence of the problems associated with accessing even a small fraction of the vast sequence space of proteins as outlined above, researchers have sought to develop strategies that significantly reduce the size of the libraries that need to be screened without compromising the likelihood of finding significant improvements in performance. For example, for many enzymes it may be sufficient just to target the active site residues 25 . Typically an active site of a protein will contain about 10-15 amino acid residues that make direct contact with the substrate (first coordination sphere) and a further 20-30 in the second coordination sphere. Morley et al. 26 analyzed results from their own work and from the work of other groups and concluded that in general, closer mutations are more beneficial, particularly in terms of the effect that they have on substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. Reetz et al. [27][28][29] have developed a very useful method termed iterative CASTing (combinatorial active site testing) in which active site residues are selected and organized into groups of two or three residues from which libraries can be subsequently generated. Screening of these initial libraries is undertaken, the hits from these libraries are combined, and new libraries are generated and are further screened in an iterative fashion. Clearly either a crystal structure or homology model is required for CASTing to be applied. Another approach to reduce the screening effort "

            "text": "A powerful theme that has recently emerged and that is highly relevant to directed evolution of enzymes is that of promiscuous activities [32][33][34] . Enzyme promiscuity refers to situations where an enzyme is able to catalyze a reaction that is quite distinct from its natural function but for which there are links between the two chemical transformations at the mechanistic rather than structural level. In order to try to understand the relationship between promiscuity and evolution of function, both Tawfik and Arnold have recently introduced the concept of neutral drift [35][36][37][38][39] . Neutral drift is the gradual accumulation of mutations under selection to maintain a protein's original function and structure. Such drifts have been demonstrated experimentally in the laboratories of Arnold and Tawfik by generating libraries and then screening for the original function rather than a new function. For example, Gupta et al. 38 studied the neutral drift of serum paraoxonase (PON1) and found that almost half of the 311 neutral variants that were characterized exhibited substantial changes in promiscuous activity. Similar changes in promiscuous activities were found by Bloom et al. 39 with P450 BM3 neutral variants.\n\nIt is generally thought that the earliest forms of enzymes had broad substrate specificity or reaction ambiguity and subsequently diverged and became more reaction-specific to give today's modern enzymes. Such enzyme superfamilies are exemplified by the enola"

In the past ten years, much effort and ingenuity have gone into the development of a broad range of screening and selection methods, including those based on ribosome display and mRNA display, to allow the identification of variants that have the desired characteristics.

The aim of this case study is to highlight some of the key strategies involved in an enzyme evolution program and also to present an analysis of the learning process. We set out to develop a platform biocatalytic technology for the preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines, which are an important class of chiral building block, particularly for the synthesis of biologically active pharmaceutical drugs (Fig. 4). Despite their importance, relatively few biocatalytic methods have been developed for their preparation, and existing methods rely principally on either the kinetic resolution of racemates using hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases and acylases or the more recent development of the use of transaminases for the conversion of ketones to chiral amines (Fig. 5). A conceptually different approach to preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines relies on deracemization of a racemic starting amine to provide either enantiomer in high optical purity. The deracemization process requires the combination of an enantioselective amine oxidase enzyme (conversion of amine to imine) together with a nonselective chemical reducing agent (reduction of imine to amine). Repeated cycles of enantioselective oxidation coupled with nonselective reduction result in accumulation of either the (R)-or (S)-amine enantiomer, depending on the stereopreference of the oxidase enzyme.\n\nPrior"

            "text": "The directed evolution experiments described above were carried out in the absence of the structure of MAO-N. Variants were simply selected on the basis of their ability to catalyze oxidation of a particular amine substrate. However, recently the three-dimensional structure of the D5 mutant of MAO-N from A. niger was solved, at a resolution of 1.8 Å, offering the prospect of shedding light on the nature of the mutations and how they might affect substrate specificity 70 . The protein crystallized with a molecule of the inhibitor L-proline at the active site, thus allowing the position of the amine substrates to be estimated. Figure 6 shows the structure with four of the five key mutations found in the D5 variant mapped onto the sequence, and it is clear that these mutations are clustered close to the active site of the protein. Examination of the structure in more detail reveals the presence of two channels, labeled A and B, that pass from the surface of the protein and that intersect at the active site. The mutations at positions 336, 384 and 385 are located within channel A on loops, r e v i e w whereas the mutation at position 246 is located within channel B. None of the 4 residues makes direct contact with the substrate; rather, they are located within the second coordination sphere. These results are interpreted as implying that the mutations at positions 336, 384, 385 and 242 in some way affect the dynamics of the two channels and hence have an effect on access of the s"

In many cases, particularly for industrial applications, the overall aim of all of these projects is to develop robust and highly selective biocatalysts for applications in synthetic organic chemistry. The chiral 1,3-diol-containing side chain of the cholesterol-lowering statin drugs (for example, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) has been a major target for biocatalysis, thus leading to the development of a number of different industrial processes that use one or more biocatalysts in the key step. One of the most elegant approaches developed involves the use of deoxyribose aldolase (DERA) to catalyze the combination of two molecules of acetaldehyde and one molecule of chloroacetaldehyde to give a product with two asymmetric centers 71 . Both carbon-carbon bonds are formed with very high levels of enantioand diastereoselectivity (Fig. 3). The wild-type enzyme was found to be inhibited by the chloroacetaldehyde and hence was subjected to rounds of directed evolution to improve its process stability. Other groups have evolved aldolases 72,73 with altered reaction stereochemistry, including a particularly impressive example by Williams et al. 74 with N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase.

For Outlook, I'll discuss future directions without being too speculative.\n\nThe word count needs to be tight - 200-300 words total.

Mainly on account of their unconventional miscibility behavior, ionic liquids show an increasing potential to revolutionize reaction technology. Their synthesis, physicochemical properties, and major fields of application have been reviewed, 6 and the number of applications of ionic liquids as reaction media for organic synthesis and catalysis is growing rapidly. Many types of ionic liquids are now commercially available in high purity. 7 Biocatalysis in ionic liquids media was first reported in 2000. [8][9][10] The early work involved ionic liquids composed of a 1,3-dialkylimidazolium or N-alkylpyridinium cation and a weakly coordinating anion (see Figure 1 and Tables 1234). These still play a major role, but the attention is slowly shifting toward new structural types.

Thus, it has recently been shown that small amounts of chloride ion cause a severe deactivation of two lipases. 18 Some early results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids proved to be difficult to reproduce, probably due to the presence of such impurities. The purity issue, as well as the detection and removal of impurities, has been reviewed recently. 16 Water is a common contaminant, as even water immiscible ionic liquids are hygroscopic and readily absorb a few percent of water. 17 Such adventitious water in ionic liquids that contain [BF 4 ] or [PF 6 ] ions may cause partial hydrolysis of these latter anions with formation of HF, which inhibits many types of enzymes.\n\nSignificant results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids require careful attention to the purity issue. The contaminants in commercial ionic liquids are usually specified by the supplier. Ionic liquids for use in anhydrous systems should be kept free of water by storage over phosphorus pentoxide. Ionic liquids that contain hydrolyzable groups, such as [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions, require testing for acid prior to use.

The subject of ionic liquid polarity has been addressed by a variety of methodologies, which will be reviewed briefly. 20 The propensity of solvents to stabilize a charge is usually determined from the absorption maximum of a solvatochromic dye, 21 such as Nile Red 22 or Reichardt's dye, 19 or by using a fluorescent probe. 23 The method actually probes the H-bond donating propensitysR in Kamlet-Taft terminology 24 swhich, in ionic liquids, is a property of the cation. 25 By this measure, the polarity of common ionic liquid types, such as the archetypical [BMIm][BF 4 ] (see Figure 1, Tables 1 and 4), is in the range of the lower alcohols 19,[25][26][27] or formamide. 28 A solvatochromic test for the coordination strength (nucleophilicity) of the anion, in contrast, indicates that the often used [PF 6 ] and [NTf 2 ] anions are much less nucleophilic (and, by implication, less \"polar\") than the lower alcohols. 25 Other aspects of polarity are dipolarity/polarizability and the H-bond accepting ability of the anion (π* and β in Kamlet-Taft terms), which have recently been measured using suitable solvatochromic dyes (see later). 29 A completely different approach to solvent polarity is "

It was soon discovered, however, that even water-miscible ionic liquids, such as [BMIm][BF 4 ], do not dissolve simple sugars to an appreciable degree. [BMIm][Cl], in contrast, dissolves massive amounts of cellulose, 39 and it was demonstrated that the ability of ionic liquids to dissolve complex compounds, such as sugars and proteins, mainly depends on the H-bond accepting properties of the anion. 40 The miscibility of ionic liquids and water varies widely and unpredictably.\n\n[BMIm][BF 4 ] and [BMIm][MeSO 4 ] are water-miscible, but [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [BMIm][Tf 2 N] are not.

The [TfO] and [NTf 2 ] anions are hydrolytically stable.\n\nDialkylimidazolium cations, in particular, have a tendency to deprotonate at C-2, with ylide (heterocarbene) formation. Such ylides are strong nucleophiles and have been used as transesterification catalysts, for example. 49 These could cause enzyme deactivation as well as background transesterification when formed in small amounts from anhydrous ionic liquids and basic buffer salts, for example.\n\nThe viscosity of ionic liquids is high compared with that of molecular solvents and increases with the chain length, among others. Consequently, diffusion is bound to be slow in ionic liquids.

[50][51][52] To put the issue into perspective, the [BMIm] and [BPy] cations were half as toxic to Daphnia magna (EC 50 approximately 20 mg L -1 ) as toluene but the 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium ion was 2500 times more toxic (EC 50 4 µg‚L -1 ). 51 Moreover, the biodegradability of ionic liquids such as [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [BMIm][BF 4 ] is negligible; 53 hence, these should be expected to persist in the environment for long periods.\n\nConsequently, for future industrial application, improved ionic liquids types will be required, which are now being developed. Examples are the choline cation, which is food grade, imidazolium derivatives designed for biodegradability, 54 and ionic liquids based on amino acids. 55,56 It is confidently expected that much improved and truly green ionic liquids will become available soon."

          "text": "Every enzyme has a characteristic three-dimensional structure. This structure, which is a prerequisite for activity, is maintained by disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonding (including water networks), and hydrophobic interaction. This latter effect is not really an interaction, apart from some slight Van der Waals contribution, but rather is the entropy-driven exclusion of hydrophobic groups from contact with water, which causes these to be buried in the protein structure. Even under physiological conditions, the stability margin of dissolved proteins is only a precarious 20-60 kJ mol -1 . 57 Unfolding requires the dissociation of many hydrogen bonds at the same time and brings the buried hydrophobic groups into contact with the solvent. Consequently, proteins are destabilized by compounds that interact specifically with the unfolded protein. It is widely accepted, on the basis of deactivation kinetics, that unfolding proceeds through two stages: a reversible first stage, followed by a slower, irreversible step.\n\nWater, the natural medium of enzyme catalysis, interacts sufficiently strongly to dissolve enzymes, but not strong enough to dissociate the structural hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that enzyme solutions in pure water are often unstable, which is why they are commonly kept in phosphate or citrate buffers. This latter stabilizing effect can be ascribed to \"salting out\" of hydrophobic groups, which increases the energy barrier to unfolding and exposure of such groups."

This latter characteristic is at the basis of the successful application of such hydrolases in nonhydrolytic reactions, such as the (enantioselective) acylation of alcohols and amines, which now are major industrial applications. 65 Interference of organic media, including ionic liquids, with enzyme activity is often discussed in terms of removal of essential water. Many enzymes indeed require a full hydration shell to be active, but there are numerous exceptions, such as CaLB, which maintains its activity upon drying over phosphorus pentoxide, 66 and the protease subtilisin, which requires only a few tightly bound water molecules per molecule of enzyme to be active. 67 It is now commonly accepted that water requirements should be discussed in terms of the thermodynamic water activity a w rather than water concentration. 64 It should be noted that performing nonhydrolytic reactions with lipases or proteases in the presence of small amounts of water, to maintain or improve the activity, will nearly always give rise to hydrolytic side reactions.

There is hardly an ionic liquid that is not tolerated by any enzyme, and the impression is that ionic liquids are generally tolerated to higher concentrations than water-miscible molecular solvents.\n\nMany hydrolases, particularly those that tolerate conventional organic solvents, are eminently capable of performing nonhydrolytic reactions in ionic liquids. Activities are generally comparable with or higher than those observed in conventional organic solvents. Furthermore, enhanced thermal and operational stabilities and regio-or enantioselectivities have been observed in many cases. Enzyme-compatible ionic liquids generally do not interact strongly with the enzyme or cause the latter to dissolve. A notable exception to this latter rule is an ionic liquid that passed the ultimate enzyme compatibility test by dissolving enzymes while their activity is maintained. There is, as yet, no theoretical basis for predicting the compatibility of ionic liquids, aqueous or anhydrous, and enzymes, but we expect that the intensity of the interest in the subject will cause one to be developed soon.\n\nIonic liquids have obvious potential as reaction media for biotransformations of highly polar substrates, such as (poly)saccharides, which cannot be performed in water, owing to equilibrium limitations.

Mainly on account of their unconventional miscibility behavior, ionic liquids show an increasing potential to revolutionize reaction technology. Their synthesis, physicochemical properties, and major fields of application have been reviewed, 6 and the number of applications of ionic liquids as reaction media for organic synthesis and catalysis is growing rapidly. Many types of ionic liquids are now commercially available in high purity. 7 Biocatalysis in ionic liquids media was first reported in 2000. [8][9][10] The early work involved ionic liquids composed of a 1,3-dialkylimidazolium or N-alkylpyridinium cation and a weakly coordinating anion (see Figure 1 and Tables 1234). These still play a major role, but the attention is slowly shifting toward new structural types.

Thus, it has recently been shown that small amounts of chloride ion cause a severe deactivation of two lipases. 18 Some early results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids proved to be difficult to reproduce, probably due to the presence of such impurities. The purity issue, as well as the detection and removal of impurities, has been reviewed recently. 16 Water is a common contaminant, as even water immiscible ionic liquids are hygroscopic and readily absorb a few percent of water. 17 Such adventitious water in ionic liquids that contain [BF 4 ] or [PF 6 ] ions may cause partial hydrolysis of these latter anions with formation of HF, which inhibits many types of enzymes.\n\nSignificant results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids require careful attention to the purity issue. The contaminants in commercial ionic liquids are usually specified by the supplier. Ionic liquids for use in anhydrous systems should be kept free of water by storage over phosphorus pentoxide. Ionic liquids that contain hydrolyzable groups, such as [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions, require testing for acid prior to use.

The subject of ionic liquid polarity has been addressed by a variety of methodologies, which will be reviewed briefly. 20 The propensity of solvents to stabilize a charge is usually determined from the absorption maximum of a solvatochromic dye, 21 such as Nile Red 22 or Reichardt's dye, 19 or by using a fluorescent probe. 23 The method actually probes the H-bond donating propensitysR in Kamlet-Taft terminology 24 swhich, in ionic liquids, is a property of the cation. 25 By this measure, the polarity of common ionic liquid types, such as the archetypical [BMIm][BF 4 ] (see Figure 1, Tables 1 and 4), is in the range of the lower alcohols 19,[25][26][27] or formamide. 28 A solvatochromic test for the coordination strength (nucleophilicity) of the anion, in contrast, indicates that the often used [PF 6 ] and [NTf 2 ] anions are much less nucleophilic (and, by implication, less \"polar\") than the lower alcohols. 25 Other aspects of polarity are dipolarity/polarizability and the H-bond accepting ability of the anion (π* and β in Kamlet-Taft terms), which have recently been measured using suitable solvatochromic dyes (see later). 29 A completely different approach to solvent polarity is "

The evident reservation here is that the ionic liquids themselves should be harmless, since any compound that is used on a large scale will find its way into the environment. The ionic liquids types that are used in biocatalysis research have not been designed for biocompatibility, however, nor for easy biodegradability. It has recently become clear that the ecotoxicity of alkylmethylimidazolium cations is undesirably high and increases with the alkyl chain length. [50][51][52] To put the issue into perspective, the [BMIm] and [BPy] cations were half as toxic to Daphnia magna (EC 50 approximately 20 mg L -1 ) as toluene but the 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium ion was 2500 times more toxic (EC 50 4 µg‚L -1 ). 51 Moreover, the biodegradability of ionic liquids such as [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [BMIm][BF 4 ] is negligible; 53 hence, these should be expected to persist in the environment for long periods.\n\nConsequently, for future industrial application, improved ionic liquids types will be required, which are now being developed.

This structure, which is a prerequisite for activity, is maintained by disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonding (including water networks), and hydrophobic interaction. This latter effect is not really an interaction, apart from some slight Van der Waals contribution, but rather is the entropy-driven exclusion of hydrophobic groups from contact with water, which causes these to be buried in the protein structure. Even under physiological conditions, the stability margin of dissolved proteins is only a precarious 20-60 kJ mol -1 . 57 Unfolding requires the dissociation of many hydrogen bonds at the same time and brings the buried hydrophobic groups into contact with the solvent. Consequently, proteins are destabilized by compounds that interact specifically with the unfolded protein. It is widely accepted, on the basis of deactivation kinetics, that unfolding proceeds through two stages: a reversible first stage, followed by a slower, irreversible step.\n\nWater, the natural medium of enzyme catalysis, interacts sufficiently strongly to dissolve enzymes, but not strong enough to dissociate the structural hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that enzyme solutions in pure water are often unstable, which is why they are commonly kept in phosphate or citrate buffers. This latter stabilizing effect can be ascribed to \"salting out\" of hydrophobic groups, which increases the energy barrier to unfolding and exposure of such groups."

This latter characteristic is at the basis of the successful application of such hydrolases in nonhydrolytic reactions, such as the (enantioselective) acylation of alcohols and amines, which now are major industrial applications. 65 Interference of organic media, including ionic liquids, with enzyme activity is often discussed in terms of removal of essential water.

In such systems, the nonenzymatic hydrocyanation is retarded because the aldehyde concentration in the aqueous phase is reduced, which affects the rate of the chemical reaction much more than the rate of the enzymatic reaction.

There is hardly an ionic liquid that is not tolerated by any enzyme, and the impression is that ionic liquids are generally tolerated to higher concentrations than water-miscible molecular solvents.\n\nMany hydrolases, particularly those that tolerate conventional organic solvents, are eminently capable of performing nonhydrolytic reactions in ionic liquids. Activities are generally comparable with or higher than those observed in conventional organic solvents. Furthermore, enhanced thermal and operational stabilities and regio-or enantioselectivities have been observed in many cases. Enzyme-compatible ionic liquids generally do not interact strongly with the enzyme or cause the latter to dissolve. A notable exception to this latter rule is an ionic liquid that passed the ultimate enzyme compatibility test by dissolving enzymes while their activity is maintained. There is, as yet, no theoretical basis for predicting the compatibility of ionic liquids, aqueous or anhydrous, and enzymes, but we expect that the intensity of the interest in the subject will cause one to be developed soon.\n\nIonic liquids have obvious potential as reaction media for biotransformations of highly polar substrates, such as (poly)saccharides, which cannot be performed in water, owing to equilibrium limitations.

[1] In fact, enzymes quite often display high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity, which makes these catalysts especially attractive for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical areas, where the interest for enantiomerically pure and specifically functionalized compounds is continuously growing. Furthermore, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are normally carried out under mild conditions, such as room temperature and neutral or almost neutral pH, which minimizes problems of product isomerization, racemization, or epimerization. In addition, enzymes can be very efficient catalysts, capable of increasing reaction rates by up to 10 12 times. Finally, biocatalytic processes are less hazardous, polluting, and energy consuming than conventional chemistry-based methodologies, especially those making use of heavy-metal catalysts.\n\nAll these reasons have made biocatalysis a popular topic for research in academia and industry and a tremendous number of enzymes have been described in the literature with a claimed potential for practical exploitation. For instance, the database BioCatalysis, based on 8000 articles and patents, describes 18 500 biotransformations carried out with enzymes, microorganisms, and catalytic antibodies.

[9] found that there was a direct correlation between activity and solvent hydrophobicity, expressed as log P (where P is the partition coefficient of a given solvent between n-octanol and water). The authors ascribed this result to differences in the ability of organic solvents to distort the essential water layer around the biocatalysts. [9] Shortly afterwards, Zaks and Klibanov [10] demonstrated, with the three unrelated enzymes yeast alcohol oxidase, mushroom polyphenol oxidase, and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, that enzyme activity was more or less coincident in the various solvents, provided that the amount of water bound to the enzyme was the same. Figure 2 a shows that the more hydrophilic the solvent is, the higher the water content of the solvent has to be to reach high activity. This happens because the water content of the enzyme (W e , Figure 2 b) and not that of the solvent (W S , Figure 2 a) is what actually matters for activity. Thus, depending on the hydrophobicity of the solvent, the same water content results in entirely different amounts of water on the enzyme. These data suggest that the effects of organic solvents on an enzyme are primarily due to interactions with the essential enzyme-bound layer of water rather than with the enzyme itself.

The identity of the mechanism of subtilisin-catalyzed ester hydrolysis in water and transesterification in organic solvents has been demonstrated by Chatterjee and Russel,[24d,e] who have also determined individual rate constants and equilibrium constants of the reaction in organic solvents.\n\nConsidering kinetic parameters in organic solvents, the values may be very different from solvent to solvent and from those for the same enzyme and substrate in aqueous media; similarly, substrate specificity may change dramatically from solvent to solvent and from water. Table 2, for example, shows that N-acetyl-l-serine ethyl ester (N-Ac-l-Ser-OEt) is the preferred substrate of subtilisin in dichloromethane, while in tert-butylamine the preferred substrate is N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine ethyl ester (N-Ac-l-Phe-OEt).

However, while protonation in water is simply controlled by adjustments of pH values, this is not the case in organic solvents, where even the concept of pH value itself is challenged. [14c] A way to control the initial state of enzyme protonation and, hence, activity was developed by Zaks and Klibanov,[24a] who showed that enzyme activity in organic solvents was markedly dependent on the pH value of the solution from which the enzyme was recovered (by lyophilization or precipitation). This methodology, which is now widely applied in the field of biocatalysis in organic solvents, is perfectly suitable when there is no alteration of acid/base concentration in the course of the reaction. If this is not the case, as in the synthesis, hydrolysis, or aminolysis of esters, for instance, the enzyme protonation and activity may change during reaction.\n\nTo overcome this drawback, the use of buffering systems involving highly hydrophobic acids and their sodium salts, and highly hydrophobic bases and their hydrochlorides, has been proposed. [27] Indeed, these systems can efficiently buffer organic solvent media, as illustrated in Figure 4 where the dependence of subtilisin activity on the composition of some acids pairs and their conjugated bases is shown. The main disadvantage of these buffer systems is that they are appreciably soluble only in solve"

[29] Therefore, in the absence of any special treatment, enzymes are usually present in organic solvents as a solid ± liquid biphasic suspension. This simplifies catalyst ± product separation and enzyme reutilization.\n\nThe simplest way to prepare biocatalysts for use in organic solvents and, at the same time, to adjust key parameters such as pH value and associated ions, is enzyme lyophilization or precipitation (by, for instance, addition of acetone) from aqueous solutions. These preparations, however, can undergo diffusional limitations or prevent enzyme ± substrate interaction because of protein ± protein stacking. The use of small enzyme particles obtained by prior sonication and vigorous shaking or stirring during reaction are recommended to alleviate these disadvantages. In some cases, ultrasonic treatment has also been done during the reaction and this has notably increased reaction rates. [30] Rate enhancements were attributed to the increase of catalyst surface area (better dispersion) or to locally high pressures.

In the following paragraphs, a few examples of solvent effects on enzyme selectivity will be considered and the possible rationales discussed.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the enantioselective performance of enzymes is generally expressed as the enantiomeric ratio E, which is the ratio of the specificity constants k cat /K m for the two enantiomers.

Various hypotheses have been formulated to rationalize this phenomenon. For instance, the solvent, depending on its polarity, could modify the enzyme conformation and, thus, influence the selectivity by altering the molecular recognition process between substrate and enzyme. [54a] According to another theory, selectivity depends on the energetics of substrate solvation, [54b] whereas a third model envisages that solvent molecules could bind within the active site and, depending on their structure, interfere with the association or transformation of one enantiomer more than with that of the other. [54d, 56] However, both the hypotheses based on the physicochemical properties of the solvents and that based on solvent structure are, at present, unsatisfactory from the point of view of predictive value. In fact, the models either appear to be valid only for the specific enzyme and substrate investigated each time [53a] or, when formation of solvent ± enzyme complexes is proposed, [56] no generalization is possible because of the large number of possible solvent ± enzyme complexes and because each complex might behave differently depending on the nature of the substrate.

Specifically, it has been proved true that many enzymes can work in organic solvents, even though it has also been observed that enzymes belonging to different classes need different hydration levels to maintain their catalytic activity, or at least a percentage of it. Additionally, although some enzymes can give really astonishing results, only few classes of these biocatalysts (such as lipases, proteases, oxynitrilases, and a few other enzymes) have proved to be synthetically useful from a practical point of view. These enzymes will be presented in the following paragraphs.\n\nOther enzymes, such as dehydrogenases and glycosidases, despite their synthetic importance, have found limited or no practical applications so far. This is mainly because they either act on polar substrates or coenzymes that are poorly soluble in organic solvents, or because they are inhibited or inactivated by organic solvents. Another more general limitation arises from the fact that numerous biocatalysts are still too expensive or not commercially available at all."

This property is synthetically very appealing, because the control of configurations of stereocenters remote from the chiral auxiliaries or catalysts applied in nonenzymatic methodology remains an unsolved problem. Despite that, the effects of distal chiral centers on the stereoselectivity of hydrolases has not been broadly studied and, consequently, not many examples have appeared in the literature.

Furthermore, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are normally carried out under mild conditions, such as room temperature and neutral or almost neutral pH, which minimizes problems of product isomerization, racemization, or epimerization. In addition, enzymes can be very efficient catalysts, capable of increasing reaction rates by up to 10 12 times. Finally, biocatalytic processes are less hazardous, polluting, and energy consuming than conventional chemistry-based methodologies, especially those making use of heavy-metal catalysts.\n\nAll these reasons have made biocatalysis a popular topic for research in academia and industry and a tremendous number of enzymes have been described in the literature with a claimed potential for practical exploitation. For instance, the database BioCatalysis, based on 8000 articles and patents, describes 18 500 biotransformations carried out with enzymes, microorganisms, and catalytic antibodies.

The authors ascribed this result to differences in the ability of organic solvents to distort the essential water layer around the biocatalysts. [9] Shortly afterwards, Zaks and Klibanov [10] demonstrated, with the three unrelated enzymes yeast alcohol oxidase, mushroom polyphenol oxidase, and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, that enzyme activity was more or less coincident in the various solvents, provided that the amount of water bound to the enzyme was the same. Figure 2 a shows that the more hydrophilic the solvent is, the higher the water content of the solvent has to be to reach high activity. This happens because the water content of the enzyme (W e , Figure 2 b) and not that of the solvent (W S , Figure 2 a) is what actually matters for activity. Thus, depending on the hydrophobicity of the solvent, the same water content results in entirely different amounts of water on the enzyme.

[14c] A way to control the initial state of enzyme protonation and, hence, activity was developed by Zaks and Klibanov,[24a] who showed that enzyme activity in organic solvents was markedly dependent on the pH value of the solution from which the enzyme was recovered (by lyophilization or precipitation). This methodology, which is now widely applied in the field of biocatalysis in organic solvents, is perfectly suitable when there is no alteration of acid/base concentration in the course of the reaction.

[53]). In the following paragraphs, a few examples of solvent effects on enzyme selectivity will be considered and the possible rationales discussed.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the enantioselective performance of enzymes is generally expressed as the enantiomeric ratio E, which is the ratio of the specificity constants k cat /K m for the two enantiomers. Equations relating the enantiomeric ratio to the value of the enantiomeric excess of the reagent or of the product, have been developed for kinetic resolutions.

[53]) show that, in order to modify or improve enzyme selectivity, medium engineering represents a good and convenient alternative to protein engineering and to the timeconsuming search for new catalysts. Various hypotheses have been formulated to rationalize this phenomenon. For instance, the solvent, depending on its polarity, could modify the enzyme conformation and, thus, influence the selectivity by altering the molecular recognition process between substrate and enzyme. [54a] According to another theory, selectivity depends on the energetics of substrate solvation, [54b] whereas a third model envisages that solvent molecules could bind within the active site and, depending on their structure, interfere with the association or transformation of one enantiomer more than with that of the other. [54d, 56] However, both the hypotheses based on the physicochemical properties of the solvents and that based on solvent structure are, at present, unsatisfactory from the point of view of predictive value. In fact, the models either appear to be valid only for the specific enzyme and substrate investigated each time [53a] or, when formation of solvent ± enzyme complexes is proposed, [56] no generalization is possible because of the large number of possible solvent ± enzyme complexes and because each complex might behave differently depending on the nature of the substrate.

Additionally, although some enzymes can give really astonishing results, only few classes of these biocatalysts (such as lipases, proteases, oxynitrilases, and a few other enzymes) have proved to be synthetically useful from a practical point of view. These enzymes will be presented in the following paragraphs.\n\nOther enzymes, such as dehydrogenases and glycosidases, despite their synthetic importance, have found limited or no practical applications so far. This is mainly because they either act on polar substrates or coenzymes that are poorly soluble in organic solvents, or because they are inhibited or inactivated by organic solvents. Another more general limitation arises from the fact that numerous biocatalysts are still too expensive or not commercially available at all."

This property is synthetically very appealing, because the control of configurations of stereocenters remote from the chiral auxiliaries or catalysts applied in nonenzymatic methodology remains an unsolved problem. Despite that, the effects of distal chiral centers on the stereoselectivity of hydrolases has not been broadly studied and, consequently, not many examples have appeared in the literature.

In this review article we sketch the current state of industrial biocatalysis in several European industries and look ahead to new processes that are likely to develop, based on current academic and industrial research. Two parallel developments are apparent in industry: chemical industries are hiring increasing numbers of life scientists, and organic chemists are beginning to embrace biocatalysis as a tool in new and difficult syntheses. This will lead to more industrial applications of biocatalysts.\n\nWork during the past decade has shown that there are surprisingly few barriers to the use of enzymes and whole cells as biocatalysts in organic synthesis 1,2 . Isolated enzymes are typically used for hydrolytic or isomerization reactions. Whole cells are often used for synthetic reactions that require cofactors which must be regenerated, because although cofactor regeneration in vitro is possible, it is generally easier and less expensive to regenerate cofactors in metabolically active cells. Both isolated enzymes and whole cells are used in industry today, and are an active area of research.\n\nEnzymes are remarkable catalysts: capable of accepting a wide array of complex molecules as substrates, and exquisitely selective, catalysing reactions with unparalleled chiral (enantio-) and positional (regio-) selectivities.

In the laboratory, new biocatalytic reactions often originate with new enzyme activities. For applications, a more rational approach is needed. The starting point will usually be a product, which can perhaps be produced by one of several possible biocatalytic reactions that convert suitable substrates to the desired product. Figure 1 illustrates the development of such biocatalytic processes. One or more biocatalysts must be identified or developed, a process must be set up, and the resulting bioconversion will ultimately have to be economically feasible. The development of such a process requires the input of many different specialists. Limiting aspects of the biocatalytic process are improved in an iterative manner, gradually leading to an efficient industrial process. In setting priorities for improvements at each process step, a detailed understanding of the costs and improvement potential of each of the partial steps in a process is vital.\n\nThe economic feasibility of a biocatalytic process depends on several factors (Fig. 1). Depending on the type of biocatalyst to be used, specific reactor and hardware configurations are needed (summarized in ref. 9)"

Such an enzyme might be available commercially, or it might have been described in the literature. Alternatively, it will be necessary to screen for organisms or enzymes that carry out the desired reaction, or completely new enzyme activities will be developed by protein design or directed evolution (see review in this issue by Arnold, pages 253-257).\n\nFor conversions that do not require regeneration of coenzymes, such as isomerization or hydrolysis reactions, both enzymes and whole cells can be selected. But when cofactors are required, whole cells are favoured because they enable cofactor regeneration. Reaction conditions for optimal enzyme function, high reactivities and long catalyst lifetimes are selected based on biocatalyst characteristics. The biocatalyst and the biocatalytic process are engineered for best performance -at the level of the enzyme (protein engineering for better activity, improved substrate range, enzyme stability), the host cell (solvent resistance, substrate import and product export, elimination of side-reactions), or the process.

Whereas the former provides enzymes with altered structure, function and selectivity, particularly in aqueous media, the latter, especially involving engineering of the enzyme microenvironment, provides striking improvements in nonaqueous environments. Indeed, it is now well known that enzymes do function in organic solvents, and many in neat (pure) solvents or in supercritical fluids in the absence of added water (see refs 13-15 and review in this issue by Klibanov, pages 241-246). Such an environment yields many potential advantages, including higher substrate solubility, reversal of hydrolytic reactions and modified enzyme specificity, which result in new enzyme activities that previously were only possible using genetic modifications or complex multistep pathways within whole cells. As a result, applications of enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents range from chiral resolution of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and their intermediates 16 to enantio-and regioselective polymerization 17 .\n\nDespite the advantages of nonaqueous conditions for biocatalytic transformations, enzymes nearly universally display low catalytic activities in these environments compared with native aqueous solutions.

Such compounds are generally insoluble in water, and often they are toxic to whole cells [29][30][31] . Thus they cannot simply be added to an aqueous medium for whole-cell transformation. Several technical solutions to this problem have been developed.\n\nOne promising approach is to use two-liquid-phase media: an aqueous phase that contains the growing cells, and an apolar solvent that contains the substrate and newly formed product [32][33][34] . Biocatalysis in emulsions is a well established technology in research laboratories [35][36][37] and is expected to be equally applicable on larger scales [38][39][40] . Moreover, solvent-based processes enable the use of well established, industrial downstream-processing techniques. For two decades from the 1970s these systems were used with various catalytically active natural hosts, often pseudomonads, but lately recombinants harbouring genes for appropriate enzymes are gaining ground. Although not particularly solvent-resistant, Escherichia coli has been used effectively as a biocatalysis host.

This necessitates the development of special methods for product extraction. In contrast to industrial bulk chemical syntheses, bioprocesses are usually operated in batch mode; continuous processes are still the exception. Recovery of product from the reaction medium generally follows the biotransformation step as a separate batch operation, after separation of biomass from the reaction mixture either by centrifugation or filtration.\n\nEven techniques as simple as precipitation of insoluble reaction products are used, for instance in the process for acrylamide production from acrylonitrile at product concentrations as high as 600 g l ǁ1 (ref. 50). Such in situ product-recovery processes, in which the product is separated from the reaction mixture during the biotransformation, have distinct advantages and are becoming popular (reviewed in ref. 51). These in situ product-recovery techniques are based on physical and chemical parameters of the reactants and range from crystallization through distillation to solid-phase or liquid-phase extraction. In general, in situ product recovery overcomes traditional limitations of biocatalytic processes such as substrate or product inhibition and product decay in aqueous reaction mixtures.\n\nIn the case of biocatalysis in mixed aqueous and apolar solvent phases, which is relevant to bioconversions of hydrocarbons and other apolar "

They consist primarily of fatty-acid chains, which are linked by ester bonds to an alcohol or polyol backbone. Lipases belong to a large class of enzymes that hydrolyse the ester bond between the fatty-acyl side chains and the lipid backbone. Understanding the catalytic cycle of lipases has been of significant importance to their widespread use in different biotechnological applications. The lipase active site is composed of three different residues: serine, histidine and aspartate or glutamate.\n\nThe hydrolysis of an ester involves an acyl enzyme complex. The catalytic cycle starts by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the serine side chain on the carbonyl carbon atom of the ester bond. The complex is resolved by the nucleophilic attack of water, the fatty acid is liberated and the enzyme is regenerated (Fig. 4).\n\nAs lipases are active in organic solvents, water can be replaced by other nucleophiles such as alcohols. The result of this reaction is a transesterification. For racemic alcohols only one enantiomer may be acylated, thereby leading to enantioselective transformations (see accompanying reviews in this issue by Walsh, pages 226-231, and Koeller and Wong, pages 232-240).

Such compounds can be synthesized stereoselectively in high enantiomeric excess by nitrilases, a class of enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of a nitrile to the corresponding ammonium salt of a carboxylic acid (Fig. 5c). Again this class of enzymes fits nicely in existing product lines and synthesis capabilities at BASF. One such sector involves hydrogen cyanide chemistry, which provides access to the starting materials for subsequent enzymatic bioconversion to chiral Ȋ-hydroxyor Ȋ-aminocarboxylic acids with nitrilases. For the Ȋ-hydroxynitriles (Fig. 5c, X = OH), both enantiomers can be used because cyanohydrins are known to racemize in aqueous solution through an equilibrium between aldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. By choosing the right pH conditions, quantitative enzymatic conversions can be achieved. Nitrilases therefore provide an extension of industrial hydrogen cyanide chemistry, giving access to a wide range of new intermediates. Microorganisms having nitrilase activity can be enriched from nature by using nitriles as the only nitrogen and/or carbon source in the growth medium. To find three new nitrilases, about 5,000 strains from enriched cultures and isolates were tested. One is currently used in a pilot plant to make R-mandelic acid on a multiton scale (Fig. 5c) 57 ."

Biocatalysis in emulsions is a well established technology in research laboratories [35][36][37] and is expected to be equally applicable on larger scales [38][39][40] . Moreover, solvent-based processes enable the use of well established, industrial downstream-processing techniques. For two decades from the 1970s these systems were used with various catalytically active natural hosts, often pseudomonads, but lately recombinants harbouring genes for appropriate enzymes are gaining ground. Although not particularly solvent-resistant, Escherichia coli has been used effectively as a biocatalysis host. Examples include the oxidation of alkanes 34,35 , aromatics such as toluene and styrene derivatives 41 , and heterocycles 42 .\n\nA related engineering approach for processes based on multiphase reaction media is gas-phase biocatalysis 43 .

Recovery of product from the reaction medium generally follows the biotransformation step as a separate batch operation, after separation of biomass from the reaction mixture either by centrifugation or filtration.\n\nEven techniques as simple as precipitation of insoluble reaction products are used, for instance in the process for acrylamide production from acrylonitrile at product concentrations as high as 600 g l ǁ1 (ref. 50). Such in situ product-recovery processes, in which the product is separated from the reaction mixture during the biotransformation, have distinct advantages and are becoming popular (reviewed in ref. 51).

They consist primarily of fatty-acid chains, which are linked by ester bonds to an alcohol or polyol backbone. Lipases belong to a large class of enzymes that hydrolyse the ester bond between the fatty-acyl side chains and the lipid backbone. Understanding the catalytic cycle of lipases has been of significant importance to their widespread use in different biotechnological applications. The lipase active site is composed of three different residues: serine, histidine and aspartate or glutamate.\n\nThe hydrolysis of an ester involves an acyl enzyme complex. The catalytic cycle starts by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the serine side chain on the carbonyl carbon atom of the ester bond. The complex is resolved by the nucleophilic attack of water, the fatty acid is liberated and the enzyme is regenerated (Fig. 4).\n\nAs lipases are active in organic solvents, water can be replaced by other nucleophiles such as alcohols. The result of this reaction is a transesterification. For racemic alcohols only one enantiomer may be acylated, thereby leading to enantioselective transformations (see accompanying reviews in this issue by Walsh, pages 226-231, and Koeller and Wong, pages 232-240).

The review covers European industries and looks ahead to new processes. Key points include: chemists hiring more life scientists, organic chemists embracing biocatalysis, differences in biocatalytic processes (enzyme kinetics, stability), and approaches for new processes - either starting with enzymes or products.\n\nI need to be careful to avoid redundancy while hitting all key elements. The word count is tight at 200-300 words, so I'll focus on the most critical information. For Background, I'll cover the current state and the modest industrial adoption despite academic promise. For Advances, I'll highlight the two parallel developments mentioned: industry hiring life scientists and organic chemists adopting biocatalysis. For Outlook, I'll discuss the process approaches - enzyme availability, product-driven selection, and emerging techniques like directed evolution.\n\nI should maintain scientific precision while making it concise. The phrase \"today and tomorrow\" in the title suggests I need to balance current state with future potential. I'll avoid technical jargon where possible but keep it professional.
