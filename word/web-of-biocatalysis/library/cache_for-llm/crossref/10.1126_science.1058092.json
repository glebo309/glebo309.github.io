The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of the remaining supernatant and induced with 1 mM IPTG and 0.25% arabinose (for pCY216). In addition 14 C-1-propionate (at 56 mCi/mmol) was added at final concentration of 0.27 mM. The culture was then stirred for an additional 12 to 15 hours at 22°C.

Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant (either 2 or 20 μl) loaded onto a Hewlett-Packard 1090 HPLC using an initial 4.6 × 10 mm column (Inertsil C18 ODS3 5 μm; Metachem Technologies Torrance CA) was washed with water (1 ml/min for 2 min) and then was loaded onto a main 4.6 × 50 mm column with the same stationary phase and flow rate. A 6-min gradient was then applied starting with 100% water and finishing with 100% acetonitrile maintained for an additional 1 min. The samples were analyzed with an Alltech evaporative light scattering detection system (ELSD500; Deerfield IL) and a peak at 6.4-min retention time was confirmed as hepta– 13 C-labeled 6dEB by mass spectrometry (MW obs = 393). Product concentrations were measured in comparison to standard 6dEB samples using the same detection scheme. At the end of the incubation period the entire culture supernatant was extracted as before with ethyl acetate dried and analyzed by 13 C-NMR. Additionally the final cell pellet was analyzed via SDS-PAGE to confirm the presence of the three DEBS proteins and the PCC. No differences were observed between the expression levels of the proteins at 12 and 48 hours post-induction. The stability of each plasmid in BAP1/pBP130/pBP144/pCY216 was also tested at 12 and 36 hours post-induction. No loss of pBP144 was observed at either time point whereas pBP130 and pCY216 were maintained in 50 and 35% of the colonies at 12 and 36 hours respectively. No rearrangement of any plasmid was detected at either time point based on restriction analysis of multiple re-transformed colonies.
