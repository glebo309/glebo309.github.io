Increasing the sustainability of both the molecules and the processes is a crucial activity at Givaudan. Biocatalysis has the potential to positively influence metrics applied at Givaudan that drive and measure our ambition to innovate responsibly, which is summarized in the FiveCarbon Path™. It targets an increased use of renewable carbon, carbon efficiency in synthesis, and the production of powerful and biodegradable odorant molecules while maximizing the use of upcycled carbon available from waste and side streams. This review illustrates with some examples how enzymes selected from the oxidoreductase and isomerase enzyme classes are applied at Givaudan for the preparation of odorant molecules both at laboratory and industrial scale.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2533/chimia.2023.384", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2023, 6, 28]], "date-time": "2023-06-28T03:36:55Z", "timestamp": 1687923415000}, "page": "384-389", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 5, "title": ["Biotechnology – A Tool to Transform Givaudan’s Fragrance Ingredients Palette"], "prefix": "10.2533", "volume": "77", "author": [{"given": "Eric", "family": "Eichhorn", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Corinne", "family": "Baumgartner", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Marc", "family": "Biermann", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "1442", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2023, 6, 28]]}, "container-title": ["CHIMIA"], "original-title": [], "link": [{"URL": "https://www.chimia.ch/chimia/article/download/2023_384/6235", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.chimia.ch/chimia/article/download/2023_384/6235", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2023, 6, 28]], "date-time": "2023-06-28T03:36:56Z", "timestamp": 1687923416000}, "score": 1, "resource": {"primary": {"URL": "https://www.chimia.ch/chimia/article/view/2023_384"}}, "subtitle": [], "short-title": [], "issued": {"date-parts": [[2023, 6, 28]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"issue": "6", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2023, 6, 28]]}}, "URL": "https://doi.org/10.2533/chimia.2023.384", "relation": {}, "ISSN": ["2673-2424", "0009-4293"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2673-2424", "type": "electronic"}, {"value": "0009-4293", "type": "print"}], "subject": [], "published": {"date-parts": [[2023, 6, 28]]}}
