    "abstract": "Abstract An immense number of chemical reactions are carried out simultaneously in living cells. Nature’s optimization approach encompasses the assembly of reactions in cascades and to embed them in finely tuned metabolic networks. With the vast progress in the field of biocatalysis, man‐made cascades, especially redox cascades, have reached a degree of complexity that needs tools for improved control and optimization. Combined strategies from biocatalysis, metabolic engineering and synthetic biology lead to the establishment of artificial metabolic pathways with minimized interference with the cellular host environment. This review will focus on genetic and metabolic engineering tools for the assembly and introduction of de novo redox pathways into the host Escherichia coli and will present state of the art redox cascades performed by tailor‐made microbial cell factories. magnified image",

    "title": "Organic Synthesis—Where now?",
    "abstract": "Abstract This review article is an attempt to sketch the important developments in organic synthesis during the past 25 years, and to project them into the future.—The primary motivations that once induced chemists to undertake natural product syntheses no longer exist. Instead of target structures themselves, molecular function and activity now occupy center stage. Thus, inhibitors with an affinity for all the important natural enzymes and receptors have moved to the fore as potential synthetic targets.—New synthetic methods are most likely to be encountered in the fields of biological and organometallic chemistry. Enzymes, whole organisms, and cell cultures for enan‐tioselective synthesis of specific substances have already been incorporated into the synthetic arsenals of both research laboratories and industry. In addition, designing appropriate analogues to transition states and intermediates should soon make it possible, with the aid of the mammalian immune system and gene technology, to prepare catalytically active monoclonal antibodies for almost any reaction; perhaps, more important, such processes will increasingly come to be applied on an industrial scale.‐The discovery of truly new reactions is likely to be limited to the realm of transition‐metal organic chemistry, which will almost certainly provide us with additional “miracle reagents” in the years to come. As regards main group elements (“organoelemental chemistry”), we can surely anticipate further stepwise improvements in experimental procedures and the broader application of special techniques, leading to undreamed of efficiency and selectivity with respect to known procedures. The primary center of attention for all synthetic methods will continue to shift toward catalytic and enantioselective variants; indeed, it will not be long before such modifications will be available with every standard reaction for converting achiral educts into chiral products. Analysis, spectroscopy, structure determination, theory, and electronic data processing have all become indispensable in organic synthesis. Only with the aid of these “tools” will the methods of organic chemistry permit selective syntheses of ever larger and more complex systems on both the molecular and supramolecular levels.—Examples have been introduced throughout this discourse to illustrate its many themes, and a very comprehensive bibliography should help the interested reader become more familiar with important keywords and authors.[ The list of references is also available upon request in the form of a Microsoft Word© file on diskette. ]—This article will have served its intended purpose if it changes the minds of some of those who claim organic chemistry is a mature science , and if it causes students to discover the vitality and forcefulness with which organic synthesis is meeting new challenges and attempting to fulfill old dreams.

    "abstract": "Abstract A straightforward one‐step biocatalyzed synthesis of different N ‐acyl amides in water was accomplished using the versatile and chemoselective acyltransferase from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsAcT). Acetylation of primary arylalkyl amines was achieved with a range of acetyl donors in biphasic systems within 1 hour and at room temperature. Vinyl acetate was the best donor which could be employed in the N ‐acetylation of a large range of primary amines in excellent yields (85–99%) after just 20 minutes. Other acyl donors (including formyl‐, propionyl‐, and butyryl‐donors) were also efficiently employed in the biocatalytic N ‐acylation. Finally, the biocatalyst was tested in transamidation reactions using acetamide as acetyl donor in aqueous medium, reaching yields of 60–70%. This work expands the toolbox of preparative methods for the formation of N ‐acyl amides, describing a biocatalytic approach easy to accomplish under mild conditions in water. magnified image",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius Squalene Hopene Cyclase was evolved to a biocatalyst suitable for (−)‐Ambrox production at industrial scale. One round of random mutagenesis led to the identification of three variants with ( E , E )‐homofarnesol conversion properties improved about 1.5‐ to 10‐fold over that of the wild type enzyme. Eight distinct amino acid mutations were identified overall; only one mutation was at the active site of the enzyme. Each of the three variants contained only two or three mutations over the 631 amino acids of the Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius Squalene Hopene Cyclase polypeptide chain. Mutations responsible for improved ( E , E )‐homofarnesol conversion were identified. Investigations on reaction conditions led to the selection of one variant, with which reaction parameters were optimized towards process‐relevant conditions. A whole cell biotransformation process is presented in which Escherichia coli cells producing an improved Squalene Hopene Cyclase variant allows the conversion of 125 g/L ( E , E )‐homofarnesol in ≤72 hours. The developed process for the production of the fragrance ingredient (−)‐Ambrox as Ambrofix® expands the biocatalysis toolbox by setting out a general basis for biocatalytic Squalene Hopene Cyclase cyclization reactions at industrial scale. magnified image",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although chemical and enzymatic catalysts have been combined, reactions in which an organometallic catalyst and a metalloenzyme work cooperatively to create products, which cannot be generated with either catalyst alone or in comparable yields by sequential reactions of the two catalysts, have not been reported. Such reactions are challenging to achieve, in part because the milieu in which these catalysts operate are typically different. Herein, two classes of catalysts are demonstrated to react cooperatively in the same system. Combination of a metathesis catalyst and a P450 enzyme lead to a dynamic equilibration of alkenes and a selective epoxidation of the cross‐metathesis products. These results show the potential of combining the two classes of catalysts for synthetic transformations.",

The immobilized Alcalase biocatalysts, which retained their activity and selectivity when stored at 4 °C for more than a year, were tested in enzymatic aminolysis in batch and continuous‐flow KRs resulting in ( S )‐ N ‐Boc‐phenylalanine benzylamide in high enantiomeric purity. In KR of the racemic thioester by Alcalase‐catalyzed aminolysis in a continuous‐flow reactor, the productivity (specific reaction rate, r flow ) and enantiomeric ratio ( E ) were studied in the 0–100 °C range. The effect of the temperature on base‐catalyzed racemization of the non‐transformed ( R )‐thioester in a continuous‐flow reactor was also investigated in the 0–150 °C range. The continuous‐mode DKR of the racemic thioester in a serial cascade system of six biocatalyst‐filled columns at 50 °C for KR and five grafted silica gel‐filled columns at 150 °C for racemization resulted in the formation of the ( S )‐benzylamide in 79% conversion, 8.17 g L −1 h −1 volumetric productivity and 98% ee . This is the first example of a dynamic kinetic resolution of an amino acid derivative in continuous‐flow mode using an alternating cascade of packed‐bed enzyme reactors and racemization reactors kept at different temperatures. magnified image",

    "abstract": "Abstract A multistep chemoenzymatic synthesis for stereodiverse polyhydroxypipecolic acid analogues, homoiminocyclitols and polyhydroxylated piperidine and pyrrolidine derivatives combining glycine‐dependent aldolases and both D ‐fructose‐6‐phosphate aldolase (FSA) or dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)‐dependent aldolases is presented. The methodology allowed the preparation of known and innovative imine‐derived molecules with a great structural diversity from simple achiral substrates. The strategy consisted of two key aldol addition steps: a first aldol addition of glycine to dimethoxyacetaldehyde catalyzed by L ‐ and D ‐glycine aldolases and a second aldol addition of DHAP, dihydroxyacetone, hydroxyacetone or glycolaldehyde using FSA or DHAP‐dependent aldolases as catalysts to a conveniently transformed aldol adduct from the first aldol addition. Catalytic reductive amination on the aldol adducts rendered the polyhydroxypipecolic acid analogues, (homo)iminocyclitols and polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine iminocyclitols. The reported strategy is thus designed to create up to five new stereogenic centers in three steps, four of them being controlled in two enzymatic reactions. Moreover, it allowed the installation of diverse functionalities in the molecules. This was possible by taking the full advantage of using aldolases in a multistep approach by virtue of their stereocomplementarity, stereoselectivity and broad substrate tolerance. magnified image",

    "title": "Deracemisation Processes Employing Organocatalysis and Enzyme Catalysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract Deracemisation methods have demonstrated their importance in the preparation of chiral compounds in the last few years. In order to resolve a racemic mixture in a dynamic sense, one enantiomer of the starting material can be converted to the other through a deracemisation procedure, that can be achieved by different mechanisms based on stereoinversion or enantioconvergence, often involving two‐opposite half reactions, with at least one of the reactions being enantioselective enough to finally obtain an enantioenriched chiral compound. The focus of this comprehensive review is on the application of deracemisation procedures in the present century in order to obtain optically active valuable compounds when employing non‐metallic catalysts. Thus, the review will mainly focus on the use of different enzymatic preparations (purified enzymes, cell‐free extracts or whole cell systems) and organocatalysts for the deracemisation of racemic mixtures. magnified image",

    "title": "Fully Enzymatic Peptide Synthesis using <i>C</i>‐Terminal <i>tert</i>‐Butyl Ester Interconversion",
    "abstract": "Abstract Chemoenzymatic peptide synthesis is potentially the most cost‐efficient technology for the synthesis of short and medium‐sized peptides with some important advantages. For instance, stoichiometric amounts of expensive coupling reagents are not required and racemisation does not occur, thus rendering purification easier compared to chemical peptide synthesis. The economically most attractive synthesis runs in the N→C terminal direction wherein a cheap C‐ terminally protected amino acid is employed as the building block for elongation. However, C ‐terminal deprotection and activation after an elongation step – without cleavage of the side‐chain protective groups or the peptide bonds – was hitherto still a challenge. In this paper we describe a novel C ‐terminal ester interconversion catalysed by the serine endopeptidase Alcalase. C ‐Terminally protected peptide tert ‐butyl esters were enzymatically converted into primary alkyl esters in quantitative yield and used directly in the next enzymatic elongation step with another amino acid tert ‐butyl ester. This fully enzymatic N→C elongation strategy by C ‐terminal ester interconversion was applied toward the synthesis of biologically active peptides up to the pentamer level.",

    "title": "Non‐Oxidative Enzymatic (De)Carboxylation of (Hetero)Aromatics and Acrylic Acid Derivatives",
    "abstract": "Abstract The utilization of carbon dioxide as a C 1 ‐building block for the production of valuable chemicals has recently attracted much interest. Whereas chemical CO 2 fixation is dominated by C−O and C−N bond forming reactions, the development of novel concepts for the carboxylation of C‐nucleophiles, which leads to the formation of carboxylic acids, is highly desired. Beside transition metal catalysis, biocatalysis has emerged as an attractive method for the highly regioselective (de)carboxylation of electron‐rich (hetero)aromatics, which has been recently further expanded to include conjugated α,β‐unsaturated (acrylic) acid derivatives. Depending on the type of substrate, different classes of enzymes have been explored for (i) the ortho ‐carboxylation of phenols catalyzed by metal‐dependent ortho ‐benzoic acid decarboxylases and (ii) the side‐chain carboxylation of para ‐hydroxystyrenes mediated by metal‐independent phenolic acid decarboxylases. Just recently, the portfolio of bio‐carboxylation reactions was complemented by (iii) the para ‐carboxylation of phenols and the decarboxylation of electron‐rich heterocyclic and acrylic acid derivatives mediated by prenylated FMN‐dependent decarboxylases, which is the main focus of this review. Bio(de)carboxylation processes proceed under physiological reaction conditions employing bicarbonate or (pressurized) CO 2 when running in the energetically uphill carboxylation direction. Aiming to facilitate the application of these enzymes in preparative‐scale biotransformations, their catalytic mechanism and substrate scope are analyzed in this review. magnified image",

    "title": "Facile Preparation of an Enzyme‐Immobilized Microreactor using a Cross‐Linking Enzyme Membrane on a Microchannel Surface",
    "abstract": "Abstract The enzyme microreactor has considerable potential for use in biotechnological syntheses and analytical studies. Simplifying the procedure of enzyme immobilization in a microreactor is attractive, and it is achievable by utilizing enzyme immobilization techniques and taking advantage of the characteristics of microfluidics. We previously developed a facile and inexpensive preparation method for an enzyme‐immobilized microreactor. The immobilization of enzymes can be achieved by the formation of an enzyme‐polymeric membrane on the inner wall of the microchannel through cross‐linking polymerization in a laminar flow. However, this method is unsuitable for use in conjunction with electronegative enzymes. Therefore, a novel preparation method using poly‐ L ‐lysine [poly(Lys)] as a booster and an adjunct for the effective polymerization of electronegative enzymes was developed in this study. Using aminoacylase as a model for an electronegative enzyme, the reaction conditions for the enzyme‐cross‐linked aggregation were optimized. On the basis of the determined conditions, an acylase‐immobilized tubing microreactor was successfully prepared by cross‐linking polymerization in a concentric laminar flow. The resulting microreactor showed a higher stability against heat and organic solvents compared to those of the free enzyme. The developed method using poly(Lys) was applicable to various enzymes with low isoelectric points, suggesting that this microreactor preparation utilizing a cross‐linked enzyme in a laminar flow could be expanded to microreactors in which a broad range of functional proteins are employed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new concept for accessing configurationally defined trisubstituted olefins has been developed. Starting from a common ketone precursor of the type 4‐ethylidenecyclohexanone, Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases are employed as catalysts in diastereoselective Baeyer–Villiger reactions leading to the corresponding E ‐ or Z ‐configurated lactones. Wild‐type cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) as catalyst delivers the E ‐isomers and a directed evolution mutant the opposite Z ‐isomers. Subsequent transition metal‐catalyzed chemical transformations of a key product containing a vinyl bromide moiety provide a variety of different trisubstituted E‐ or Z‐ olefins. A model based on QM/MM sheds light on the origin of this unusual type of diastereoselectivity. In contrast to this biocatalytic approach, traditional Baeyer–Villiger reagents such as m ‐CPBA fail to show any selectivity, 1:1 mixtures of E ‐ and Z ‐olefins being formed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The morphinan skeleton is an important sub‐structure in many medicines such as dextromethorphan, and can be constructed from 1‐benzyl‐1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8‐octahydroisoquinoline (1‐benzyl‐OHIQ) derivatives. 1‐Benzyl‐3,4,5,6,7,8‐hexahydroisoquinolines (1‐benzyl‐HHIQs), the precursors of 1‐benzyl‐OHIQs, constitute a type of bulky α, β‐unsaturated imines. Until now, the application of imine reductases (IREDs) to α, β‐unsaturated imines has only rarely been reported. In this study, through evaluation of 48 IREDs, both enantiomers of 1‐(4‐methoxybenzyl)‐1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8‐octahydroisoquinoline (1‐(4‐methoxybenzyl)‐OHIQ) were obtained in high yield and excellent optical purity. Among the enzymes, the most steric hindrance‐tolerant IRED from Sandarearacinus amylolyticus (IR40) was able to convert various phenyl substituted 1‐benzyl‐HHIQ to the corresponding 1‐benzyl‐OHIQ derivatives with excellent enantiometric excess. These results provide an effective route to synthesize these important compounds via enantioselective reduction of bulky α, β‐unsaturated imine precursors, which can be readily prepared from 2‐(1‐cyclohexenyl)ethylamine and corresponding aryl acetic acids. magnified image",

Herein we describe two biocatalytically relevant subclasses of flavoprotein monooxygenases with a close evolutionary relation: subclass A represented by p ‐hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH) and subclass E formed by styrene monooxygenases (SMOs). PHBH family members perform highly regioselective hydroxylations on a wide variety of aromatic compounds.

Both enzymes were immobilised as cross‐linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs). Stability tests show that the nitrile hydratase CLEAs are sensitive to water‐immiscible organic solvents as well as to aldehydes and hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but are remarkably stable and show useful activity in acidic aqueous environments of pH 4–5. The cascade reactions are consequently carried out by using a portionwise feed of HCN and moderate concentrations of aldehyde in acidic aqueous buffer to suppress the uncatalysed hydrocyanation background reaction. After optimisation, this method was used to synthesise five different kinds of aliphatic α‐hydroxycarboxylic amides from the corresponding aldehydes with good yields and with enantiomeric purities comparable to those obtained for the α‐hydroxynitriles in the microaqueous hydrocyanation using hydroxynitrile lyase and an excess of HCN.",

However, redox deracemization of racemic 1,2,3,4‐tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acids as an attractive method is still challenging for the lack of suitable oxidoreductases. Herein, a D‐amino acid oxidase from Fusarium solani M‐0718 ( Fs DAAO) with broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity was exploited through genome mining, and applied for the kinetic resolution of a number of racemic 1‐ and 3‐carboxyl substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines to yield the corresponding ( S )‐enantiomers with excellent enantiomeric excess ( ee ) values (up to >99%). By using Fs DAAO in combination with ammonia‐borane in one pot, deracemization of these racemic carboxyl‐substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved with conversions up to >98% and >99% ee . Preparative‐scale deracemization of racemic 1,2,3,4‐tetrahydroisoquinoline‐1‐carboxylic acid and 1,2,3,4‐tetrahydroisoquinoline‐3‐carboxylic acid was also demonstrated with good isolated yields (82% and 73%, respectively) and ee >99%. Our study provides an effective method for the synthesis of enantiomeric pure 1,2,3,4‐tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acids.

There are six main building blocks or modules (α, β, γ, δ, ε, and ζ) that make up the structures of these enzymes: the αα and αδ head‐to‐tail trans‐prenyl transferases that produce trans ‐isoprenoid diphosphates from C 5 precursors; the ε head‐to‐head prenyl transferases that convert these diphosphates into the tri‐ and tetraterpene precursors of sterols, hopanoids, and carotenoids; the βγ di‐ and triterpene synthases; the ζ head‐to‐tail cis‐prenyl transferases that produce the cis ‐isoprenoid diphosphates involved in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis; and finally the α, αβ, and αβγ terpene synthases that produce plant terpenes, with many of these modular enzymes having originated from ancestral α and β domain proteins. We also review progress in determining the structure and function of the two 4Fe‐4S reductases involved in formation of the C 5 diphosphates in many bacteria, where again, highly modular structures are found.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Prochiral bicyclic diketones were transformed to a single diastereomer of 3‐substituted cyclohexylamine derivatives via three consecutive biocatalytic steps. The two chiral centres were set up by a CC hydrolase (6‐oxocamphor hydrolase) in the first step and by an ω‐transaminase in the last step. The esterification of the intermediate keto acid was catalysed by a lipase in the second step if possible. For two substrates the CC hydrolytic step as well as the esterification could be run simultaneously in a one‐pot cascade in an organic solvent. In one example, the reaction mixture of the first two steps could be directly subjected to bio‐amination in an organic solvent without the need to change the reaction medium. Depending on the choice of the ω‐transaminase employed and the substrate the cis ‐ as well as the trans ‐diastereomers could be obtained in optically pure forms.",

Training data are utilized for making decisions and predictions. Since directed evolution of enzymes produces huge amounts of potential training data, machine learning seems to be ideally suited to support this protein engineering technique. Machine learning has been used in protein science for a long time with different purposes. This mini‐review focuses on the utility of machine learning as an aid in the directed evolution of selective enzymes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chiral amines represent a prominent functional group in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals and are hence attractive targets for asymmetric synthesis. Since the pharmaceutical industry has identified biocatalysis as a valuable tool for synthesising chiral molecules with high enantiomeric excess and under mild reaction conditions, enzymatic methods for chiral amine synthesis are increasing in importance. Among the strategies available in this context, the asymmetric reduction of imines by NAD(P)H‐dependent enzymes and the related reductive amination of ketones have long remained underrepresented. However, recent years have witnessed an impressive progress in the application of natural or engineered imine‐reducing enzymes, such as imine reductases, opine dehydrogenases, amine dehydrogenases, and artificial metalloenzymes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of biocatalytic imine reduction and reductive amination of ketones, highlighting the natural roles, substrate scopes, structural features, and potential application fields of the involved enzymes. magnified image",

A dramatic increase in enzyme activity is observed. The sol‐gel lipase immobilizates are also excellent catalysts in the kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols and amines, recycling without any substantial loss in enantioselectivity and a residual activity of 70% being possible even after 20 reaction cycles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Asymmetric reductive aminations are some of the most important reactions in the preparation of active pharmaceuticals, as chiral amines feature in many of the world's most important drugs. Although many enzymes have been applied to the synthesis of chiral amines, the development of reductive amination reactions that use enzymes is attractive, as it would permit the one‐step transformation of readily available prochiral ketones into chiral amines of high optical purity. However, as most natural “reductive aminase” activities operate on keto acids, and many are able to use only ammonia as the amine donor, there is considerable scope for the engineering of natural enzymes for the reductive amination of ketones, and also for the preparation of secondary amines using alkylamines as donors. This review summarises research into the development of NAD(P)H‐dependent dehydrogenases for the reductive amination of ketones, including amino acid dehydrogenases (AADHs), natural amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs), opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs) and imine reductases (IREDs). In each case knowledge of the structure and mechanism of the enzyme class is addressed, with a further description of the engineering of those enzymes for the reductive amination of ketones towards primary and also secondary amine products. magnified image",

    "abstract": "Abstract The synthesis of the amide bond between an amine and a carboxylic acid is one of the most significant reactions in industrial pharmaceutical synthesis. Despite the apparent simplicity of synthetic methods for amide bond formation, many of these are disadvantaged by their requirement for toxic or hazardous reagents for the activation of the acid component, or poor atom economy resulting from the need for stoichiometric amounts of coupling reagents. In this context, biocatalysis has emerged as an alternative catalytic method for amide bond formation, presenting the advantages of both environmentally benign reagents and conditions and also atom economy. In this review we detail developments in the enzyme‐catalysed preparation of secondary and tertiary amides for the synthesis of pharmaceutical‐type molecules and review the applications of hydrolases, such as lipases and penicillin acylases, to these reactions. We also summarise the activity of ATP‐dependent enzymes for amide bond formation and assess their potential for the preparative synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines in aqueous media. magnified image",

    "title": "Asymmetric Amination of α‐Chiral Aliphatic Aldehydes <i>via</i> Dynamic Kinetic Resolution to Access Stereocomplementary Brivaracetam and Pregabalin Precursors",
    "abstract": "Abstract Over the last decades biocatalysis has emerged as an indispensable and versatile tool for the asymmetric synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). In this context, especially transaminases (TAs) have been successfully used for the preparation of numerous α‐chiral, optically pure amines, serving as important building blocks for APIs. Here we elaborate on the development of transaminases recognizing the α‐chiral centre adjacent to an aldehyde moiety with aliphatic residues, opening up concepts for novel synthetic routes to the antiepileptic drugs Brivaracetam and Pregabalin. The transformation proceeded via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) based on the bio‐induced racemisation of the aldehyde enantiomers, enabling the amination of the racemic substrates with quantitative conversions. Medium, substrate as well as enzyme engineering gave access to both ( R )‐ and ( S )‐enantiomers of the amine precursors of the stereocomplementary drugs in high optical purity, representing a short route to mentioned APIs. magnified image",

    "title": "Rational Design of Modular Polyketide Synthases: Morphing the Aureothin Pathway into a Luteoreticulin Assembly Line",
    "abstract": "Abstract The unusual nitro‐substituted polyketides aureothin, neoaureothin (spectinabilin), and luteoreticulin, which are produced by diverse Streptomyces species, point to a joint evolution. Through rational genetic recombination and domain exchanges we have successfully reprogrammed the modular (type I) aur polyketide synthase (PKS) into a synthase that generates luteoreticulin. This is the first rational transformation of a modular PKS to produce a complex polyketide that was initially isolated from a different bacterium. A unique aspect of this synthetic biology approach is that we exclusively used genes from a single biosynthesis gene cluster to design the artificial pathway, an avenue that likely emulates natural evolutionary processes. Furthermore, an unexpected, context‐dependent switch in the regiospecificity of a pyrone methyl transferase was observed. We also describe an unprecedented scenario where an AT domain iteratively loads an extender unit onto the cognate ACP and the downstream ACP. This aberrant function is a novel case of non‐colinear behavior of PKS domains.",

We demonstrate that SHOOT phylogenetic placements are as accurate as conventional tree inference, and it can identify orthologs with high accuracy. In summary, SHOOT is a fast and accurate tool for phylogenetic analyses of novel query sequences. It is available online at www.shoot.bio .",

These biohybrid systems were devoted to prepare dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and phosphorylated sugars through stereoselective C−C bond formation. In the first system, two kinases were exploited for the in situ generation of DHAP. Increasing the complexity, the second nano‐bioreactor combined up to four enzymes to lead to d ‐fructose‐6‐phosphate from the aldol‐catalyzed addition of dihydroxyacetone to d ‐glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate generated in situ from DHAP. The biohybrid catalyst showed the same reaction rate as that of the free enzymes and was reusable.",

    "title": "Engineering proteinase K using machine learning and synthetic genes",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Altering a protein's function by changing its sequence allows natural proteins to be converted into useful molecular tools. Current protein engineering methods are limited by a lack of high throughput physical or computational tests that can accurately predict protein activity under conditions relevant to its final application. Here we describe a new synthetic biology approach to protein engineering that avoids these limitations by combining high throughput gene synthesis with machine learning-based design algorithms. Results We selected 24 amino acid substitutions to make in proteinase K from alignments of homologous sequences. We then designed and synthesized 59 specific proteinase K variants containing different combinations of the selected substitutions. The 59 variants were tested for their ability to hydrolyze a tetrapeptide substrate after the enzyme was first heated to 68°C for 5 minutes. Sequence and activity data was analyzed using machine learning algorithms. This analysis was used to design a new set of variants predicted to have increased activity over the training set, that were then synthesized and tested. By performing two cycles of machine learning analysis and variant design we obtained 20-fold improved proteinase K variants while only testing a total of 95 variant enzymes. Conclusion The number of protein variants that must be tested to obtain significant functional improvements determines the type of tests that can be performed. Protein engineers wishing to modify the property of a protein to shrink tumours or catalyze chemical reactions under industrial conditions have until now been forced to accept high throughput surrogate screens to measure protein properties that they hope will correlate with the functionalities that they intend to modify. By reducing the number of variants that must be tested to fewer than 100, machine learning algorithms make it possible to use more complex and expensive tests so that only protein properties that are directly relevant to the desired application need to be measured. Protein design algorithms that only require the testing of a small number of variants represent a significant step towards a generic, resource-optimized protein engineering process.",

    "title": "Bioproduction of the aroma compound 2‐Phenylethanol in a solid–liquid two‐phase partitioning bioreactor system by <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>",
    "abstract": "Abstract The rose‐like aroma compound 2‐phenylethanol (2‐PE) is an important fragrance and flavor ingredient. Several yeast strains are able to convert l ‐phenylalanine ( l ‐phe) to 2‐PE among which Kluyveromyces marxianus has shown promising results. The limitation of this process is the low product concentration and productivity primarily due to end product inhibition. This study explored the possibility and benefits of using a solid–liquid Two‐Phase Partition Bioreactor (TPPB) system as an in situ product removal technique. The system applies polymer beads as the sequestering immiscible phase to partition 2‐PE and reduce the aqueous 2‐PE concentration to non‐inhibitory levels. Among six polymers screened for extracting 2‐PE, Hytrel® 8206 performed best with a partition coefficient of 79. The desired product stored in the polymer was ultimately extracted using methanol. A 3 L working volume solid–liquid batch mode TPPB using 500 g Hytrel® as the sequestering phase generated a final overall 2‐PE concentration of 13.7 g/L, the highest reported in the current literature. This was based on a polymer phase concentration of 88.74 g/L and aqueous phase concentration of 1.2 g/L. Even better results were achieved via contact with more polymers (approximately 900 g) with the aqueous phase applying a semi‐continuous reactor configuration. In this system, a final 2‐PE concentration (overall) of 20.4 g/L was achieved with 1.4 g/L in the aqueous and 97 g/L in the polymer phase. The overall productivities of these two reactor systems were 0.38 and 0.43 g/L h, respectively. This is the first report in the literature of the use of a polymer sequestering phase to enhance the bioproduction of 2‐PE, and exceeds the performance of two‐liquid phase systems in terms of productivity as well as ease of operation (no emulsions) and ultimate product recovery.

In spite of their versatility, the application of heme enzymes was long time‐limited for the industry due to their low activity and stability in large scale processes. The identification of novel natural biocatalysts and recent advances in protein engineering have led to new reactions with a high application potential. The latest creation of a serine‐ligated mutant of BM3 showed an efficient transfer of reactive carbenes into C═C bonds of olefins reaching total turnover numbers of more than 60,000 and product titers of up to 27 g/L −1 . This prominent example shows that heme enzymes are becoming competitive to chemical syntheses while being already advantageous in terms of high yield, regioselectivity, stereoselectivity and environmentally friendly reaction conditions. Advances in reactor concepts and the influencing parameters on reaction performance are also under investigation resulting in improved productivities and increased stability of the heme biocatalytic systems. In this mini review, we briefly present the latest advancements in the field of heme enzymes towards increased reaction scope and applicability.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In order to design a biocatalyst for the production of optically pure styrene oxide, an important building block in organic synthesis, the metabolic pathway and molecular biology of styrene degradation in Pseudomonas sp. strain VLB120 was investigated. A 5.7-kb Xho I fragment, which contained on the same strand of DNA six genes involved in styrene degradation, was isolated from a gene library of this organism in Escherichia coli by screening for indigo formation. T7 RNA polymerase expression experiments indicated that this fragment coded for at least five complete polypeptides, StyRABCD, corresponding to five of the six genes. The first two genes encoded the potential carboxy-terminal part of a sensor, named StySc, and the complete response regulator StyR. Fusion of the putative styAp promoter to a lacZ reporter indicated that StySc and StyR together regulate expression of the structural genes at the transcriptional level. Expression of styS c R also alleviated a block that prevented translation of styA mRNA when a heterologous promoter was used. The structural genes styA and styB produced a styrene monooxygenase that converted styrene to styrene oxide, which was then converted to phenylacetaldehyde by StyC. Sequence homology analysis of StyD indicated a probable function as a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase. To assess the usefulness of the enzymes for the production of enantiomerically pure styrene oxide, we investigated the enantiospecificities of the reactions involved. Kinetic resolution of racemic styrene oxide by styrene oxide isomerase was studied with E. coli recombinants carrying styC , which converted styrene oxide at a very high rate but with only a slight preference for the S enantiomer. However, recombinants producing styrene monooxygenase catalyzed the formation of ( S )-styrene oxide from inexpensive styrene with an excellent enantiomeric excess of more than 99% at rates up to 180 U g (dry weight) of cells −1 .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hydroquinone (HQ) is produced commercially from benzene by multi‐step Hock‐type processes with equivalent amounts of acetone as side‐product. We describe an efficient biocatalytic alternative using the cytochrome P450‐BM3 monooxygenase. Since the wildtype enzyme does not accept benzene, a semi‐rational protein engineering strategy was developed. Highly active mutants were obtained which transform benzene in a one‐pot sequence first into phenol and then regioselectively into HQ without any overoxidation. A computational study shows that the chemoselective oxidation of phenol by the P450‐BM3 variant A82F/A328F leads to the regioselective formation of an epoxide intermediate at the C3=C4 double bond, which departs from the binding pocket and then undergoes fragmentation in aqueous medium with exclusive formation of HQ. As a practical application, an E. coli designer cell system was constructed, which enables the cascade transformation of benzene into the natural product arbutin, which has anti‐inflammatory and anti‐bacterial activities.",

    "abstract": "DERA (2-Deoxy-D-ribose 5-phosphate aldolase) is the only known aldolase that accepts two aldehyde substrates, which makes it an attractive catalyst for the synthesis of a chiral polyol motif that is present in several pharmaceuticals, such as atorvastatin and pravastatin. However, inactivation of the enzyme in the presence of aldehydes hinders its practical application. Whole cells of Pectobacterium atrosepticum were reported to exhibit good tolerance toward acetaldehyde and to afford 2-deoxyribose 5-phosphate with good yields. The DERA gene (PaDERA) was identified, and both the wild-type and a C49M mutant were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The purification protocol was optimized and an initial biochemical characterization was conducted. Unlike other DERAs, which show a maximal activity between pH 4.0 and 7.5, PaDERA presented an optimum pH in the alkaline range between 8.0 and 9.0. This could warrant its use for specific syntheses in the future. PaDERA also displayed fourfold higher specific activity than DERA from E. coli (EcDERA) and displayed a promising acetaldehyde resistance outside the whole-cell environment. The C49M mutation, which was previously identified to increase acetaldehyde tolerance in EcDERA, also led to significant improvements in the acetaldehyde tolerance of PaDERA.",

To address this problem, a derivative of Escherichia coli has been genetically engineered.

    "abstract": "Computational design is a test of our understanding of enzyme catalysis and a means of engineering novel, tailor-made enzymes. While the de novo computational design of catalytically efficient enzymes remains a challenge, designed enzymes may comprise unique starting points for further optimization by directed evolution. Directed evolution of two computationally designed Kemp eliminases, KE07 and KE70, led to low to moderately efficient enzymes ( k cat / K m values of ≤ 5 × 10 4 M -1 s -1 ). Here we describe the optimization of a third design, KE59. Although KE59 was the most catalytically efficient Kemp eliminase from this design series (by k cat / K m , and by catalyzing the elimination of nonactivated benzisoxazoles), its impaired stability prevented its evolutionary optimization. To boost KE59’s evolvability, stabilizing consensus mutations were included in the libraries throughout the directed evolution process. The libraries were also screened with less activated substrates. Sixteen rounds of mutation and selection led to > 2,000-fold increase in catalytic efficiency, mainly via higher k cat values. The best KE59 variants exhibited k cat / K m values up to 0.6 × 10 6 M -1 s -1 , and k cat / k uncat values of ≤ 10 7 almost regardless of substrate reactivity. Biochemical, structural, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies provided insights regarding the optimization of KE59. Overall, the directed evolution of three different designed Kemp eliminases, KE07, KE70, and KE59, demonstrates that computational designs are highly evolvable and can be optimized to high catalytic efficiencies.",

    "abstract": "SCHEMA structure-guided recombination of 3 fungal class II cellobiohydrolases (CBH II cellulases) has yielded a collection of highly thermostable CBH II chimeras. Twenty-three of 48 genes sampled from the 6,561 possible chimeric sequences were secreted by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterologous host in catalytically active form. Five of these chimeras have half-lives of thermal inactivation at 63 °C that are greater than the most stable parent, CBH II enzyme from the thermophilic fungus Humicola insolen s, which suggests that this chimera collection contains hundreds of highly stable cellulases. Twenty-five new sequences were designed based on mathematical modeling of the thermostabilities for the first set of chimeras. Ten of these sequences were expressed in active form; all 10 retained more activity than H. insolens CBH II after incubation at 63 °C. The total of 15 validated thermostable CBH II enzymes have high sequence diversity, differing from their closest natural homologs at up to 63 amino acid positions. Selected purified thermostable chimeras hydrolyzed phosphoric acid swollen cellulose at temperatures 7 to 15 °C higher than the parent enzymes. These chimeras also hydrolyzed as much or more cellulose than the parent CBH II enzymes in long-time cellulose hydrolysis assays and had pH/activity profiles as broad, or broader than, the parent enzymes. Generating this group of diverse, thermostable fungal CBH II chimeras is the first step in building an inventory of stable cellulases from which optimized enzyme mixtures for biomass conversion can be formulated.",

    "title": "Improving the Properties of Bacterial <i>R</i>‐Selective Hydroxynitrile Lyases for Industrial Applications",
    "abstract": "Abstract Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNLs) catalyse the reversible cleavage of cyanohydrins to carbonyl compounds and HCN. The recent discovery of bacterial HNLs with a cupin fold gave rise to a new promising class of these enzymes. They are interesting candidates for the synthesis of cyanohydrins on an industrial scale owing to their high expression levels in Escherichia coli . The activity and enantioselectivity of the manganese‐dependent HNL from Granulicella tundricola ( Gt HNL) were significantly improved by site‐saturation mutagenesis of active site amino acids. The combination of beneficial mutations resulted in a variant with 490‐fold higher specific activity in comparison to the wild‐type enzyme. More importantly, Gt HNL‐A40H/V42T/Q110H is a highly competitive alternative for the synthesis of chiral cyanohydrins, such as 2‐chlorobenzaldehyde cyanohydrin, ( R )‐2‐hydroxy‐4‐phenylbutyronitrile, and ( R )‐2‐hydroxy‐4‐phenyl‐3‐butene nitrile, which serve as intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A three‐step, two‐enzyme, one‐pot reaction sequence starting from prochiral α‐chloroketones leading to enantiopure β‐azidoalcohols and β‐hydroxynitriles is described. Asymmetric bioreduction of α‐chloroketones by hydrogen transfer catalysed by an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) established the stereogenic centre in the first step to furnish enantiopure chlorohydrin intermediates. Subsequent biocatalysed ring closure to the epoxide and nucleophilic ring opening with azide, N 3 – , or cyanide, CN – , both catalysed by a nonselective halohydrin dehalogenase (Hhe) proceeded with full retention of configuration to give enantiopure β‐azidoalcohols and β‐hydroxynitriles, respectively. Both enantiomers of various optically pure β‐azidoalcohols and β‐hydroxynitriles were synthesised. (© Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 69451 Weinheim, Germany, 2009)",

    "title": "An evolutionary route to xylanase process fitness",
    "abstract": "Abstract Directed evolution technologies were used to selectively improve the stability of an enzyme without compromising its catalytic activity. In particular, this article describes the tandem use of two evolution strategies to evolve a xylanase, rendering it tolerant to temperatures in excess of 90°C. A library of all possible 19 amino acid substitutions at each residue position was generated and screened for activity after a temperature challenge. Nine single amino acid residue changes were identified that enhanced thermostability. All 512 possible combinatorial variants of the nine mutations were then generated and screened for improved thermal tolerance under stringent conditions. The screen yielded eleven variants with substantially improved thermal tolerance. Denaturation temperature transition midpoints were increased from 61°C to as high as 96°C. The use of two evolution strategies in combination enabled the rapid discovery of the enzyme variant with the highest degree of fitness (greater thermal tolerance and activity relative to the wild‐type parent).",

    "title": "Enzyme stabilization by covalent binding in nanoporous sol‐gel glass for nonaqueous biocatalysis",
    "abstract": "Abstract A unique nanoporous sol‐gel glass possessing a highly ordered porous structure (with a pore size of 153 Å in diameter) was examined for use as a support material for enzyme immobilization. A model enzyme, α‐chymotrypsin, was efficiently bound onto the glass via a bifunctional ligand, trimethoxysilylpropanal, with an active enzyme loading of 0.54 wt%. The glass‐bound chymotrypsin exhibited greatly enhanced stability both in aqueous solution and organic solvents. The half‐life of the glass‐bound α‐chymotrypsin was >1000‐fold higher than that of the native enzyme, as measured either in aqueous buffer or anhydrous methanol. The enhanced stability in methanol, which excludes the possibility of enzyme autolysis, particularly reflected that the covalent binding provides effective protection against enzyme inactivation caused by structural denaturation. In addition, the activity of the immobilized α‐chymotrypsin was also much higher than that of the native enzyme in various organic solvents. From these results, it appears that the glass–enzyme complex developed in the present work can be used as a high‐performance biocatalyst for various chemical processing applications, particularly in organic media.

    "abstract": "Abstract Chiral polyesters in general can be employed for versatile biomedical purposes, but in vitro enzyme catalyzed biocatalytic routes by a multiple‐step cascade to make these functional biodegradable chiral polyesters have been hardly investigated. Recently, we developed an artificial three‐step enzymatic cascade synthesis by combining an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO) and a lipase (CAL‐A). Here, we extended this cascade for the synthesis of chiral methyl‐substituted oligo‐ɛ‐caprolactone derivatives to achieve both, the generation of chirality in a monomer and the subsequent polymerization. Several substrates were examined and provided access to functionalized chiral compounds in high yields (up to >99 %) and optical purities (up to >99 % ee). By subsequent enzymatic enantioselective ring opening of the enantiopure monomers, oligomeric lactones were successfully synthesized.",

When exposed to mechanical stress, residual activity, [E] t /[E] 0 , and residual protein were found to scale proportionally with gas‐liquid surface area in the bubble column, verifying a surface‐driven process, and with time and total throughput in a gear pump, but did not seem to be influenced much by shear in a Couette viscometer. All FDH variants are deactivated by chaotropes but not kosmotropes: the first‐order deactivation constant k d correlates well with the Jones‐Dole coefficient B but not well with the surface tension increment Δσ of various concentrated ammonium salt solutions. This finding might provide guidance for focusing the search for quantitative theories of Hofmeister effects.",

Here, we report a strategy to change the catalytic activity of an existing protein scaffold. This was achieved by simultaneous incorporation and adjustment of functional elements through insertion, deletion, and substitution of several active site loops, followed by point mutations to fine-tune the activity. Using this approach, we were able to introduce β-lactamase activity into the αβ/βα metallohydrolase scaffold of glyoxalase II. The resulting enzyme, evMBL8 (evolved metallo β-lactamase 8), completely lost its original activity and, instead, catalyzed the hydrolysis of cefotaxime with a ( k cat / K m ) app of 1.8 × 10 2 (mole/liter) –1 second –1 , thus increasing resistance to Escherichia coli growth on cefotaxime by a factor of about 100.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Directed evolution of stereo‐, regio‐, and chemoselective enzymes constitutes a unique way to generate biocatalysts for synthetically interesting transformations in organic chemistry and biotechnology. In order for this protein engineering technique to be efficient, fast, and reliable, and also of relevance to synthetic organic chemistry, methodology development was and still is necessary. Following a description of early key contributions, this review focuses on recent developments. It includes optimization of molecular biological methods for gene mutagenesis and the design of efficient strategies for their application, resulting in notable reduction of the screening effort (bottleneck of directed evolution). When aiming for laboratory evolution of selectivity and activity, second‐generation versions of Combinatorial Active‐Site Saturation Test (CAST) and Iterative Saturation Mutagenesis (ISM), both involving saturation mutagenesis (SM) at sites lining the binding pocket, have emerged as preferred approaches, aided by in silico methods such as machine learning. The recently proposed Focused Rational Iterative Site‐specific Mutagenesis (FRISM) constitutes a fusion of rational design and directed evolution. On‐chip solid‐phase chemical gene synthesis for rapid library construction enhances library quality notably by eliminating undesired amino acid bias, the future of directed evolution?",

    "abstract": "Yeast—especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae—have long been a preferred workhorse for the production of numerous recombinant proteins and other metabolites. S. cerevisiae is a noteworthy aroma compound producer and has also been exploited to produce foreign bioflavour compounds. In the past few years, important strides have been made in unlocking the key elements in the biochemical pathways involved in the production of many aroma compounds. The expression of these biochemical pathways in yeast often involves the manipulation of the host strain to direct the flux towards certain precursors needed for the production of the given aroma compound. This review highlights recent advances in the bioengineering of yeast—including S. cerevisiae—to produce aroma compounds and bioflavours. To capitalise on recent advances in synthetic yeast genomics, this review presents yeast as a significant producer of bioflavours in a fresh context and proposes new directions for combining engineering and biology principles to improve the yield of targeted aroma compounds.",

    "abstract": "The steroidal hydroxylases CYP5150AP3 and CYP5150AN1 together with the previously characterized CYP5150AP2 belong to the CYP5150A family of P450 enzymes with high amino acid sequence identity, but they showed completely different regioselectivities toward 11-deoxycortisol, suggesting the regioselectivity diversity of steroidal hydroxylases of CYP5150 family. They are also distinct from the known bacterial and fungal steroidal hydroxylases in substrate specificity and regioselectivity. Biocatalytic hydroxylation is one of the important transformations for the functionalization of steroid nucleus rings but remains a very challenging task in organic synthesis. These hydroxylases are useful additions to the toolbox of hydroxylase enzymes for the functionalization of steroids at various positions.",

Although biocatalysts have previously been employed for the Pictet–Spengler reaction, not a single one accepts benzaldehyde and its substituted derivatives. To address this challenge, a combination of substrate walking and transfer of beneficial mutations between different wild‐type backbones was used to develop a strictosidine synthase from Rauvolfia serpentina ( Rs STR) into a suitable enzyme for the asymmetric Pictet–Spengler condensation of tryptamine and benzaldehyde derivatives. The double variant Rs STR V176L/V208A accepted various ortho ‐, meta ‐ and para ‐substituted benzaldehydes and produced the corresponding chiral 1‐aryl‐tetrahydro‐β‐carbolines with up to 99 % enantiomeric excess.",

Use of specific lipases gives products which are unobtainable by chemical interesterification methods. Some of these products have properties of value to the oils and fats industry. The catalysts for enzymatic interesterification are prepared by coating inorganic support materials with the lipases. For batch interesterification reactions, the catalyst particles are activated by addition of a small amount of water and then stirred with a reactant mixture dissolved in petroleum ether. At the end of the reaction period, the catalyst particles are removed by filtration, and the interesterified triglycerides isolated by conventional fat fractionation techniques. The catalyst can be used in subsequent batch reactions. As an alternative to the batch reaction system, continuous enzymatic interesterification processes can be operated by pumping water containg feedstock through a packed bed of activated catalyst.",

Herein, an efficient process that allows reactions to proceed in high conversion in the absence of by‐product removal using only one equivalent of a diamine donor ( ortho ‐xylylenediamine) is reported. This operationally simple method is compatible with the most widely used ( R )‐ and ( S )‐selective ω‐TAs and is particularly suitable for the conversion of substrates with unfavorable equilibrium positions (e.g., 1‐indanone). Significantly, spontaneous polymerization of the isoindole by‐product generates colored derivatives, providing a high‐throughput screening platform to identify desired ω‐TA activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For the planning of an organic synthesis route, the disconnection approach guided by retrosynthetic analysis of possible intermediates and the chemical reactions involved, back to ready available starting materials, is well established. In contrast, such concepts just get developed for biocatalytic routes. In this Review we highlight functional group interconversions catalyzed by enzymes. The article is organized rather by chemical bonds formed—exemplified for C−N, C−O‐ and C−C‐bonds—and not by enzyme classes, covering a broad range of reactions to incorporate the desired functionality in the target molecule. Furthermore, the successful use of biocatalysts, also in combination with chemical steps, is exemplified for the synthesis of various drugs and advanced pharmaceutical intermediates such as Crispine A, Sitagliptin and Atorvastatin. This Review also provides some basic guidelines to choose the most appropriate enzyme for a targeted reaction keeping in mind aspects like commercial availability, cofactor‐requirement, solvent tolerance, use of isolated enzymes or whole cell recombinant microorganisms aiming to assist organic chemists in the use of enzymes for synthetic applications.",

Here, we describe a deep learning–based protein sequence design method, ProteinMPNN, that has outstanding performance in both in silico and experimental tests. On native protein backbones, ProteinMPNN has a sequence recovery of 52.4% compared with 32.9% for Rosetta. The amino acid sequence at different positions can be coupled between single or multiple chains, enabling application to a wide range of current protein design challenges. We demonstrate the broad utility and high accuracy of ProteinMPNN using x-ray crystallography, cryo–electron microscopy, and functional studies by rescuing previously failed designs, which were made using Rosetta or AlphaFold, of protein monomers, cyclic homo-oligomers, tetrahedral nanoparticles, and target-binding proteins.",

Packing densities of aldehyde groups on the activated agarose surface could be controlled in a gel range of 7–60 μ mol/ml aldehyde by the amount of glycidol used. The immobilization yield was nearly 100% at pH 10.5, and the specific activity of the immobilized UK was equivalent to about 80% of soluble UK under the assay conditions. The immobilized UK showed an improvement in pH and thermal stability, probably due to the structural rigidity imparted by multi‐point linkages to the matrix. The cleavage rate by the immobilized UK was lower than that of the soluble enzyme but the side reaction of cryptic cleavage was significantly decreased, which might suggest that the enzyme's specificity was altered by the immobilization. Cleavage yield in the column packed with immobilized UK was dependent on the feed rate, and the yield was approx. 80% of that of the soluble UK. The monomeric hGH could be obtained by selectively precipitating the uncleaved fusion protein and the GST fragments at an acidic pH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biocatalytic alkylations are important reactions to obtain chemo‐, regio‐ and stereoselectively alkylated compounds. This can be achieved using S‐adenosyl‐ l ‐methionine (SAM)‐dependent methyltransferases and SAM analogs. It was recently shown that a halide methyltransferase (HMT) from Chloracidobacterium thermophilum can synthesize SAM from SAH and methyl iodide. We developed an iodide‐based assay for the directed evolution of an HMT from Arabidopsis thaliana and used it to identify a V140T variant that can also accept ethyl‐, propyl‐, and allyl iodide to produce the corresponding SAM analogs (90, 50, and 70 % conversion of 15 mg SAH). The V140T AtHMT was used in one‐pot cascades with O ‐methyltransferases (IeOMT or COMT) to achieve the regioselective ethylation of luteolin and allylation of 3,4‐dihydroxybenzaldehyde. While a cascade for the propylation of 3,4‐dihydroxybenzaldehyde gave low conversion, the propyl‐SAH intermediate could be confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY Metagenomics (also referred to as environmental and community genomics) is the genomic analysis of microorganisms by direct extraction and cloning of DNA from an assemblage of microorganisms. The development of metagenomics stemmed from the ineluctable evidence that as-yet-uncultured microorganisms represent the vast majority of organisms in most environments on earth. This evidence was derived from analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified directly from the environment, an approach that avoided the bias imposed by culturing and led to the discovery of vast new lineages of microbial life. Although the portrait of the microbial world was revolutionized by analysis of 16S rRNA genes, such studies yielded only a phylogenetic description of community membership, providing little insight into the genetics, physiology, and biochemistry of the members. Metagenomics provides a second tier of technical innovation that facilitates study of the physiology and ecology of environmental microorganisms. Novel genes and gene products discovered through metagenomics include the first bacteriorhodopsin of bacterial origin; novel small molecules with antimicrobial activity; and new members of families of known proteins, such as an Na + (Li + )/H + antiporter, RecA, DNA polymerase, and antibiotic resistance determinants. Reassembly of multiple genomes has provided insight into energy and nutrient cycling within the community, genome structure, gene function, population genetics and microheterogeneity, and lateral gene transfer among members of an uncultured community. The application of metagenomic sequence information will facilitate the design of better culturing strategies to link genomic analysis with pure culture studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Construction of highly efficient microbial cell factories producing drop-in biofuel alkanes is severely limited due to the lack of a fast detection method against alkanes. Here we first developed a sensitive fluorescent biosensor for rapid and in situ monitoring of intracellular alkane synthesis. Using GFP as reporter, the biosensor could actively respond to the intracellular alkane products, especially for the mid- and long-chain alkanes synthesized in the recombinant Escherichia coli and give a concentration-dependent fluorescence response. Our results also suggested the feasibility of developing high-throughput strategies basing on the alkane biosensor device in E. coli and thus will greatly facilitate the application of directed evolution strategies to further improve the alkane-producing microbial cell factories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial metalloenzymes have received increasing attention over the last decade as a possible solution to unaddressed challenges in synthetic organic chemistry. Whereas traditional transition‐metal catalysts typically only take advantage of the first coordination sphere to control reactivity and selectivity, artificial metalloenzymes can modulate both the first and second coordination spheres. This difference can manifest itself in reactivity profiles that can be truly unique to artificial metalloenzymes. This Review summarizes attempts to modulate the second coordination sphere of artificial metalloenzymes by using genetic modifications of the protein sequence. In doing so, successful attempts and creative solutions to address the challenges encountered are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During the last 20 years, focus has shifted from haloperoxidases to flavin‐dependent and non‐heme‐iron halogenases because of their proven involvement in the biosynthesis of halogenated metabolites in different organisms and the regioselectivity of their reactions. During the first 10–12 years, the main research topics were the detection of halogenases as well as the elucidation of three‐dimensional structures and reaction mechanisms. This Review mainly deals with studies on halogenating enzymes published between 2010 and 2015. It focusses on the elucidation of the involvement of halogenating enzymes in halometabolite biosynthesis, application of halogenases in in vivo and in vitro systems, in vivo modification of biosynthetic pathways in bacteria and plants, improvement of enzyme stability, broadening of substrate specificity, and the combination of biocatalysis with chemical synthesis to produce new compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding mutational effects on protein stability and solubility is of particular importance for creating industrially relevant biocatalysts, resolving mechanisms of many human diseases, and producing efficient biopharmaceuticals, to name a few. For in silico predictions, the complexity of the underlying processes and increasing computational capabilities favor the use of machine learning. However, this approach requires sufficient training data of reasonable quality for making precise predictions. This minireview aims to summarize and scrutinize available mutational datasets commonly used for training predictors. We analyze their structure and discuss the possible directions of improvement in terms of data size, quality, and availability. We also present perspectives on the development of mutational data for accelerating the design of efficient predictors, introducing two new manually curated databases FireProt DB and SoluProtMut DB for protein stability and solubility, respectively.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT New production routes for fine and bulk chemicals are important to establish further sustainable processes in industry. Besides the identification of new biocatalysts and new production routes the optimization of existing processes in regard to an improved utilization of the catalysts are needed. In this paper we describe the successful expression of P450BM3 on the surface of E. coli cells with the Autodisplay system. The successful hydroxylation of palmitic acid by using surface‐displayed P450BM3 was shown. Besides optimization of surface protein expression, several cofactor regeneration systems were compared and evaluated. Afterwards, the development of a suitable process for the biocatalytic hydroxylation of fatty acids based on the re‐use of the catalysts after a simple centrifugation was investigated. It was shown that the catalyst can be used for several times without any loss in activity. By using surface‐displayed P450s in combination with an enzymatic cofactor regeneration system a total turnover number of up to 54,700 could be reached, to the knowledge of the authors the highest value reported for a P450 monooxygenase to date. Further optimizations of the described reaction system can have an enormous impact on the process design for more sustainable bioprocesses. Biotechnol.

    "abstract": "Abstract Efforts to drive catalytic reactions with light, inspired by natural processes like photosynthesis, have a long history and have seen significant recent growth. Successfully engineering systems using biomolecular and bioinspired catalysts to carry out light‐driven chemical reactions capitalizes on advantages offered from the fields of biocatalysis and photocatalysis. In particular, driving reactions under mild conditions and in water, in which enzymes are operative, using sunlight as a renewable energy source yield environmentally friendly systems. Furthermore, using enzymes and bioinspired systems can take advantage of the high efficiency and specificity of biocatalysts. There are many challenges to overcome to fully capitalize on the potential of light‐driven biocatalysis. In this mini‐review, we discuss examples of enzymes and engineered biomolecular catalysts that are activated via electron transfer from a photosensitizer in a photocatalytic system. We place an emphasis on selected forefront chemical reactions of high interest, including CH oxidation, proton reduction, water oxidation, CO 2 reduction, and N 2 reduction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High selectivity and exquisite control over the outcome of reactions entice chemists to use biocatalysts in organic synthesis. However, many useful reactions are not accessible because they are not in nature’s known repertoire. In this Review, we outline an evolutionary approach to engineering enzymes to catalyze reactions not found in nature. We begin with examples of how nature has discovered new catalytic functions and how such evolutionary progression has been recapitulated in the laboratory starting from extant enzymes. We then examine non‐native enzyme activities that have been exploited for chemical synthesis, with an emphasis on reactions that do not have natural counterparts. Non‐natural activities can be improved by directed evolution, thus mimicking the process used by nature to create new catalysts. Finally, we describe the discovery of non‐native catalytic functions that may provide future opportunities for the expansion of the enzyme universe.",

    "title": "Expanding the metabolic engineering toolbox with directed evolution",
    "abstract": "Abstract Cellular systems can be engineered into factories that produce high‐value chemicals from renewable feedstock. Such an approach requires an expanded toolbox for metabolic engineering. Recently, protein engineering and directed evolution strategies have started to play a growing and critical role within metabolic engineering. This review focuses on the various ways in which directed evolution can be applied in conjunction with metabolic engineering to improve product yields. Specifically, we discuss the application of directed evolution on both catalytic and non‐catalytic traits of enzymes, on regulatory elements, and on whole genomes in a metabolic engineering context. We demonstrate how the goals of metabolic pathway engineering can be achieved in part through evolving cellular parts as opposed to traditional approaches that rely on gene overexpression and deletion. Finally, we discuss the current limitations in screening technology that hinder the full implementation of a metabolic pathway‐directed evolution approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We recently characterized the substrate scope of wild‐type RebH and proceeded to evolve variants of this enzyme with improved stability for biocatalysis. The substrate scopes of both RebH and the stabilized variants, however, are limited primarily to compounds similar in size to tryptophan. A substrate walking approach was used to further evolve RebH variants with expanded substrate scope. Two particularly notable variants were identified: 3‐SS, which provides high conversion of tricyclic tryptoline derivatives; and 4‐V, which accepts a broad range of large indoles and carbazoles. This constitutes the first reported use of directed evolution to enable the functionalization of substrates not accepted by wild‐type RebH and demonstrates the utility of RebH variants for the site‐selective halogenation of biologically active compounds.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The selective hydroxylation of unactivated C−H bonds in complex natural products represents a formidable challenge in synthetic organic chemistry. Cyperenoic acid, a sesquiterpenoid isolated from Croton crassifolius , possesses an antiangiogenic‐promoting effect. Its C7‐ and C9α‐hydroxylated products can significantly inhibit the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). To prepare these hydroxylated products, cytochrome P450 BM3 monooxygenase was chosen as a catalyst for the hydroxylation of cyperenoic acid. A simple and fast strategy, slightly reshaping the binding pocket of P450 BM3, was described to expedite the development of highly regio‐ and stereoselective P450 catalysts. P450 BM3 was evolved through one or two generations of mutations, and a highly enriched mutant library that contained fewer than 30 variants was then constructed. The obtained P450 BM3 variants achieved selective hydroxylation at positions C7 (94 % selectivity in the case of the F87A/A330W/F331L mutant) and C9 (90 % regioselectivity and 100 % stereoselectivity in the case of the L75V/F87A/T88F/A330W mutant) of cyperenoic acid and were also used to prepare the desired hydroxylated products at a preparative scale with high isolated yields.",

Availability of methodologies for site-selective modification of biomolecules remains a long-standing challenge, given the inherent complexity and the presence of repeating residues that bear functional groups with similar reactivity profiles. We describe a bioconjugation strategy for modification of native peptides relying on high site selectivity conveyed by enzymes. We engineered penicillin G acylases to distinguish among free amino moieties of insulin (two at amino termini and an internal lysine) and manipulate cleavable phenylacetamide groups in a programmable manner to form protected insulin derivatives. This enables selective and specific chemical ligation to synthesize homogeneous bioconjugates, improving yield and purity compared to the existing methods, and generally opens avenues in the functionalization of native proteins to access biological probes or drugs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A new member of the CYP116B subfamily—P450 La MO —was discovered in Labrenzia aggregata by genomic data mining. It was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli , purified, and subsequently characterized spectroscopically, and its catalytic properties were assessed. Substrate profiling of the P450 La MO revealed that it was a versatile catalyst, exhibiting hydroxylation and epoxidation activities as well as O ‐dealkylation and asymmetric sulfoxidation activities. Diverse compounds, including alkylbenzenes, aromatic bicyclic molecules, and terpenoids, were shown to be hydroxylated by P450 La MO . Such diverse catalytic activities are uncommon for the bacterial P450s, and the P450 La MO ‐mediated stereoselective hydroxylation of inactivated CH bonds—ubiquitous and relatively unreactive in organic molecules—is particularly unusual. The self‐sufficient nature of P450 La MO , coupled with its broad substrate range, highlights it as an ideal template for directed evolution towards various applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peroxygenases catalyze a broad range of (stereo)selective oxyfunctionalization reactions. However, to access their full catalytic potential, peroxygenases need a balanced provision of hydrogen peroxide to achieve high catalytic activity while minimizing oxidative inactivation. Herein, we report an enzymatic cascade process that employs methanol as a sacrificial electron donor for the reductive activation of molecular oxygen. Full oxidation of methanol is achieved, generating three equivalents of hydrogen peroxide that can be used completely for the stereoselective hydroxylation of ethylbenzene as a model reaction. Overall we propose and demonstrate an atom‐efficient and easily applicable alternative to established hydrogen peroxide generation methods, which enables the efficient use of peroxygenases for oxyfunctionalization reactions.",

    "title": "Rational Co‐Immobilization of Bi‐Enzyme Cascades on Porous Supports and their Applications in Bio‐Redox Reactions with In Situ Recycling of Soluble Cofactors",
    "abstract": "Abstract In bio‐redox cascade reactions that are immobilized on porous supports, mass‐transfer limitations may impede the effective concentration of the cofactor around the corresponding dehydrogenases. This main drawback has been addressed by the co‐immobilization of both the main and recycling dehydrogenases. Herein, we report tailor‐made co‐immobilization procedures to assemble three different bio‐redox orthogonal cascades in vitro (two selective reductions and one selective oxidation) with in situ cofactor‐regeneration. However, the co‐immobilization itself does not guarantee the success of the biotransformation because the same co‐immobilization chemistry may not be suitable for the two enzymes that are involved in the bio‐redox cascade. Therefore, our co‐immobilization system was optimized for each bi‐enzymatic cascade. In all cases, the optimized co‐immobilization procedure was more efficient in the biocatalytic cascade than if the two dehydrogenases were immobilized on two different carriers. In one specific case (one thermophilic cascade), the co‐immobilization of an optimal ratio of main/recycling dehydrogenases (1:5) on the same carrier resulted in a biocatalyst that was able to recycle NADH up to 9000 times per equivalent of substrate in 1 hour at 55 °C. Moreover, uniform distributions of both dehydrogenases across the porous surface also enhanced the recycling efficiency of the cofactor 1.5‐fold versus cascades in which the enzymes were not uniformly distributed across the same porous surface, presumably because of vicinal cooperation effects. Hence, this system for the co‐immobilization of bi‐enzymatic systems may be extended to other biocatalytic cascades, thereby opening a window for the optimization of other multi‐enzyme biotransformations in which cofactor‐recycling is necessary.",

    "title": "RNA-Puzzles Round III: 3D RNA structure prediction of five riboswitches and one ribozyme",
    "abstract": "RNA-Puzzles is a collective experiment in blind 3D RNA structure prediction. We report here a third round of RNA-Puzzles. Five puzzles, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, all structures of riboswitch aptamers and puzzle 7, a ribozyme structure, are included in this round of the experiment. The riboswitch structures include biological binding sites for small molecules ( S -adenosyl methionine, cyclic diadenosine monophosphate, 5-amino 4-imidazole carboxamide riboside 5′-triphosphate, glutamine) and proteins (YbxF), and one set describes large conformational changes between ligand-free and ligand-bound states. The Varkud satellite ribozyme is the most recently solved structure of a known large ribozyme. All puzzles have established biological functions and require structural understanding to appreciate their molecular mechanisms. Through the use of fast-track experimental data, including multidimensional chemical mapping, and accurate prediction of RNA secondary structure, a large portion of the contacts in 3D have been predicted correctly leading to similar topologies for the top ranking predictions. Template-based and homology-derived predictions could predict structures to particularly high accuracies. However, achieving biological insights from de novo prediction of RNA 3D structures still depends on the size and complexity of the RNA. Blind computational predictions of RNA structures already appear to provide useful structural information in many cases. Similar to the previous RNA-Puzzles Round II experiment, the prediction of non-Watson–Crick interactions and the observed high atomic clash scores reveal a notable need for an algorithm of improvement. All prediction models and assessment results are available at http://ahsoka.u-strasbg.fr/rnapuzzles/ .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Highly productive biocatalytic reductions were established using an isolated alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) under water‐deficient conditions. First, a solvent‐free system was evaluated for the reduction of 2‐butanone catalyzed by ADH evo‐1.1.200 promoted by the “smart cosubstrate” 1,4‐butanediol. ADH evo‐1.1.200 excelled by its activity and stability under high reagent concentrations and hence was the enzyme of choice. However, conversion of 2‐butanone was limited to <1 % in 10 days under the solvent‐free conditions. Therefore, water‐immiscible organic solvents were evaluated whereby the highest conversions were achieved in MTBE and toluene. MTBE was chosen as its different boiling point compared to other reaction components (e.g., 2‐butanone, 2‐butanol, diol cosubstrate, and lactone coproduct) would simplify the downstream processing. Further on, by tuning substrate loading, the productivity of the ADH evo‐1.1.200 was successfully increased to a turnover number (TON) of 64 000.",

    "title": "Biotechnological Production of Flavonoids: An Update on Plant Metabolic Engineering, Microbial Host Selection, and Genetically Encoded Biosensors",
    "abstract": "Abstract Flavonoids represent a diversified family of phenylpropanoid‐derived plant secondary metabolites. They are widely found in fruits, vegetables, and medicinal herbs. There has been increasing interest on flavonoids because of their proven bioactivity associated with anti‐obesity and anti‐cancer, anti‐inflammatory and anti‐diabetic activity. Low bioavailability of flavonoids is a major challenge restricting their applications. Due to safety and economic issues, plant extraction or chemical synthesis could not provide a scalable route for large‐scale production. Alternatively, reconstruction of biosynthetic gene clusters in plants and industrially relevant microbes offer significant promise for discovery and scalable synthesis of flavonoids. This review provides an update on biotechnological production of flavonoids. The recent advances on plant metabolic engineering, microbial host, and genetically encoded biosensors are summarized. Plant metabolic engineering holds the promise to improve the yield of specific flavonoids and expand the chemical space of novel flavonoids. The choice of microbial host provides the cellular chassis that could be tailored for various stereo‐ or regio‐selective chemistries that are crucial for their bioactivities. When coupled with transcriptional biosensing, genetically encoded biosensors could be welded into cellular metabolism to achieve high throughput screening or dynamic carbon flux re‐allocation to deliver efficient microbial workhorse. The convergence of these technologies will translate the vast majority of plant genetic resources into valuable flavonoids with pharmaceutical/nutraceutical values in the foreseeable future.",

Since C7 is spatially far away from any functional groups that could direct C−H activation, these transformations are not readily accessible using modern synthetic organic techniques. Reported here are P450‐BM3 mutants that catalyze the oxidative hydroxylation of six different steroids with pronounced C7 regioselectivities and β stereoselectivities, as well as high activities. These challenging transformations were achieved by a focused mutagenesis strategy and application of a novel technology for protein library construction based on DNA assembly and USER (Uracil‐Specific Excision Reagent) cloning. Upscaling reactions enabled the purification of the respective steroidal alcohols in moderate to excellent yields. The high‐resolution X‐ray structure and molecular dynamics simulations of the best mutant unveil the origin of regio‐ and stereoselectivity.",

    "title": "Structural, Functional, and Spectroscopic Characterization of the Substrate Scope of the Novel Nitrating Cytochrome P450 TxtE",
    "abstract": "Abstract A novel cytochrome P450 enzyme, TxtE, was recently shown to catalyze the direct aromatic nitration of L ‐tryptophan. This unique chemistry inspired us to ask whether TxtE could serve as a platform for engineering new nitration biocatalysts to replace current harsh synthetic methods. As a first step toward this goal, and to better understand the wild‐type enzyme, we obtained high‐resolution structures of TxtE in its substrate‐free and substrate‐bound forms. We also screened a library of substrate analogues for spectroscopic indicators of binding and for production of nitrated products. From these results, we found that the wild‐type enzyme accepts moderate decoration of the indole ring, but the amino acid moiety is crucial for binding and correct positioning of the substrate and therefore less amenable to modification. A nitrogen atom is essential for catalysis, and a carbonyl must be present to recruit the αB′ 1 helix of the protein to seal the binding pocket.",

This review just focuses on selected examples of the last year and putting them into context to a previously published suggestion for classification. Subdividing the cascades according to the number of catalysts in the linear sequence, and classifying whether the steps are performed simultaneous or in a sequential fashion as well as whether the reaction sequence is performed in vitro or in vivo allows to organise the concepts. The last year showed, that combinations of in vivo as well as in vitro are possible. Incompatible reaction steps may be run in a sequential fashion or by compartmentalisation of the incompatible steps either by using special reactors (membrane), polymersomes or flow techniques.",

Drawing on inspiration from heme-based radical polymerizations, Zhou et al . screened a panel of metalloproteins for candidates that could catalyze an atom-transfer radical cyclization, producing a lactam from an amide substrate bearing bromoalkyl and alkene functional groups (see the Perspective by Zhang and Dydio). Cytochrome P-450 derivatives were effective catalysts, and a series of enzyme variants were generated by directed evolution to access the full range of enantiomer and diastereomer products for model substrates. Such biocatalysts are valuable additions to the synthetic chemistry toolkit and reiterate the potential of metalloenzymes in catalyzing useful unnatural reactions. —MAF",

Here we demonstrate functional screening of a million-membered metagenomic library in microfluidic picolitre droplet compartments. Using bait substrates, new hydrolases for sulfate monoesters and phosphotriesters were identified, mostly based on promiscuous activities presumed not to be under selection pressure. Spanning three protein superfamilies, these break new ground in sequence space: promiscuity now connects enzymes with only distantly related sequences. Most hits could not have been predicted by sequence analysis, because the desired activities have never been ascribed to similar sequences, showing how this approach complements bioinformatic harvesting of metagenomic sequencing data. Functional screening of a library of unprecedented size with excellent assay sensitivity has been instrumental in identifying rare genes constituting catalytically versatile hubs in sequence space as potential starting points for the acquisition of new functions.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The property of loose stereochemical control at aldol products from aldolases helped to synthesize multiple polyhydroxylated compounds with nonnatural stereoconfiguration. In this study, we discovered for the first time that some fructose 1,6-diphosphate aldolases (FruA) and tagatose 1,6-diphosphate (TagA) aldolases lost their strict stereoselectivity when using l -glyceraldehyde and synthesized not only l -sorbose but also a high proportion of l -psicose. Among the aldolases tested, TagA from Bacillus licheniformis (BGatY) showed the highest enzyme activity with l -glyceraldehyde. Subsequently, a “one-pot” reaction based on BGatY and fructose-1-phosphatase (YqaB) generated 378 mg/liter l -psicose and 199 mg/liter l -sorbose from dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP) and l -glyceraldehyde. Because of the high cost and instability of DHAP, a microbial fermentation strategy was used further to produce l -sorbose/ l -psicose from glucose and l -glyceraldehyde, in which DHAP was obtained from glucose through the glycolytic pathway, and some recombination pathways based on FruA or TagA and YqaB were constructed in Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum strains. After evaluation of different host cells and combinations of FruA or TagA with YqaB and optimization of gene expression, recombinant C. glutamicum strain WT(pXFTY) was selected and produced 2.53 g/liter total ketoses, with a yield of 0.50 g/g l -glyceraldehyde. Moreover, deletion of gene cgl0331 , encoding the Zn-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase in C. glutamicum , was confirmed for the first time to significantly decrease conversion of l -glyceraldehyde to glycerol and to increase yield of target products. Finally, fed-batch culture of strain SY14(pXFTY) produced 3.5 g/liter l -sorbose and 2.3 g/liter l -psicose, with a yield of 0.61 g/g l -glyceraldehyde. This microbial fermentation strategy also could be applied to efficiently synthesize other l -sugars.",

Although this pathway evolved in plants, algae, and microorganisms over billions of years, many reactions and enzymes could aid in the production of desired chemical products instead of biomass. Schwander et al. constructed an optimized synthetic carbon fixation pathway in vitro by using 17 enzymes—including three engineered enzymes—from nine different organisms across all three domains of life (see the Perspective by Gong and Li). The pathway is up to five times more efficient than the in vivo rates of the most common natural carbon fixation pathway.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases (BMMs) are a heterogeneous family of di-iron monooxygenases which share the very interesting ability to hydroxylate aliphatic and/or aromatic hydrocarbons. Each BMM possesses defined substrate specificity and regioselectivity which match the metabolic requirements of the strain from which it has been isolated. Pseudomonas sp. strain OX1, a strain able to metabolize o -, m -, and p -cresols, produces the BMM toluene/ o -xylene monooxygenase (ToMO), which converts toluene to a mixture of o -, m -, and p -cresol isomers. In order to investigate the molecular determinants of ToMO regioselectivity, we prepared and characterized 15 single-mutant and 3 double-mutant forms of the ToMO active site pocket. Using the Monte Carlo approach, we prepared models of ToMO-substrate and ToMO-reaction intermediate complexes which allowed us to provide a molecular explanation for the regioselectivities of wild-type and mutant ToMO enzymes. Furthermore, using binding energy values calculated by energy analyses of the complexes and a simple mathematical model of the hydroxylation reaction, we were able to predict quantitatively the regioselectivities of the majority of the variant proteins with good accuracy. The results show not only that the fine-tuning of ToMO regioselectivity can be achieved through a careful alteration of the shape of the active site but also that the effects of the mutations on regioselectivity can be quantitatively predicted a priori.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array‐synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user‐defined sequences (up to ∼350 bases in length) have emerged as a low‐cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost ≤10 % (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next‐generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence‐function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de‐novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.",

The major strategy used was to reconstitute the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of E. coli with DAOCS catalyzed reaction; thus the metabolic flux of central metabolism was forced to go through DAOCS catalyzed reaction to produce G-7-ADCA. This strategy was combined with engineering efforts to reduce the accumulation of acetate and the degradation of penicillin G and G-7-ADCA to improve the conversion rate of penicillin G by DAOCS significantly. Therefore, this work demonstrates the feasibility to redirect the TCA cycle to drive a desired enzyme reaction, and this strategy could be applied to other enzymes that catalyze TCA cycle-coupleable reactions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microbially derived surfactants, so‐called biosurfactants, have drawn much attention in recent years and are expected to replace current petrochemical surfactants, owing to their environmental and toxicological benefits. One strategy to support that goal is to reduce production costs by replacing relatively expensive sugars with cheaper raw materials, such as short‐chain alkanes. Herein, we report the successful one‐pot total synthesis of rhamnolipids, a class of biosurfactants with 12 stereocenters, from butane as sole carbon and energy source through the design of a tailored whole‐cell biocatalyst.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While belonging to the most fundamental functional groups, nitriles represent a class of compound that still raises challenges in terms of an efficient, cost‐effective, general and, at the same time, sustainable way for their synthesis. Complementing existing chemical routes, recently a cyanide‐free enzymatic process technology based on the use of an aldoxime dehydratase (Oxd) as a biocatalyst component has been developed and successfully applied for the synthesis of a range of nitrile products. In these biotransformations, the Oxd enzymes catalyze the dehydration of aldoximes as readily available substrates to the nitrile products. Herein, these developments with such enzymes are summarized, with a strong focus on synthetic applications. It is demonstrated that this biocatalytic technology has the potential to “cross the bridge” between the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, on one hand, and bulk and commodity chemicals, on the other.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The rapid increase in the number of proteins in sequence databases and the diversity of their functions challenge computational approaches for automated function prediction. Here, we introduce DeepFRI, a Graph Convolutional Network for predicting protein functions by leveraging sequence features extracted from a protein language model and protein structures. It outperforms current leading methods and sequence-based Convolutional Neural Networks and scales to the size of current sequence repositories. Augmenting the training set of experimental structures with homology models allows us to significantly expand the number of predictable functions. DeepFRI has significant de-noising capability, with only a minor drop in performance when experimental structures are replaced by protein models. Class activation mapping allows function predictions at an unprecedented resolution, allowing site-specific annotations at the residue-level in an automated manner. We show the utility and high performance of our method by annotating structures from the PDB and SWISS-MODEL, making several new confident function predictions. DeepFRI is available as a webserver at https://beta.deepfri.flatironinstitute.org/ .",

Crystal structures of seven designs are very similar to the computational models (median root mean square deviation: 0.6 angstroms), as are three cryo–electron microscopy structures of giant 10-nanometer rings with up to 1550 residues and C 33 symmetry; all differ considerably from previously solved structures. Our results highlight the rich diversity of new protein structures that can be generated using deep learning and pave the way for the design of increasingly complex components for nanomachines and biomaterials.",

One of the most attractive strategies is the stereoselective installation of a chiral amine through C−H amination, which is a challenging chemical transformation. Herein we report the application of a multienzyme cascade, generated in a single bacterial whole‐cell system, which is able to catalyze stereoselective benzylic aminations with ee values of 97.5 %. The cascade uses four heterologously expressed recombinant enzymes with cofactors provided by the host cell and isopropyl amine added as the amine donor. The cascade presents the first example of the successful de novo design of a single whole‐cell biocatalyst for formal stereoselective C−H amination.",

However, in the last 5 years, the field of immunochemistry has taken a new direction. With the aid of mechanistic and synthetic chemistry, the vast network of molecules and cells of the immune system has been tapped to produce antibodies with a new function—catalytic antibodies. Because antibodies can be generated that selectively bind almost any molecule of interest, this new technology offers the potential to tailor-make highly selective catalysts for applications in biology, chemistry, and medicine. In addition, catalytic antibodies provide fundamental insight into important aspects of biological catalysis, including the importance of transition-state stabilization, proximity effects, general acid and base catalysts, electrophilic and nucleophilic catalysis, and strain.",

    "title": "UMI-linked consensus sequencing enables phylogenetic analysis of directed evolution",
    "abstract": "Abstract The success of protein evolution campaigns is strongly dependent on the sequence context in which mutations are introduced, stemming from pervasive non-additive interactions between a protein’s amino acids (‘intra-gene epistasis’). Our limited understanding of such epistasis hinders the correct prediction of the functional contributions and adaptive potential of mutations. Here we present a straightforward unique molecular identifier (UMI)-linked consensus sequencing workflow (UMIC-seq) that simplifies mapping of evolutionary trajectories based on full-length sequences. Attaching UMIs to gene variants allows accurate consensus generation for closely related genes with nanopore sequencing. We exemplify the utility of this approach by reconstructing the artificial phylogeny emerging in three rounds of directed evolution of an amine dehydrogenase biocatalyst via ultrahigh throughput droplet screening. Uniquely, we are able to identify lineages and their founding variant, as well as non-additive interactions between mutations within a full gene showing sign epistasis. Access to deep and accurate long reads will facilitate prediction of key beneficial mutations and adaptive potential based on in silico analysis of large sequence datasets.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ketones are crucial intermediates in synthesis and frequent moieties in many products. The direct regioselective synthesis of ketones from internal alkenes could simplify synthetic routes and solve a long-standing challenge in catalysis. Here we report the laboratory evolution of a cytochrome P450 enzyme for the direct oxidation of internal arylalkenes to ketones with several thousand turnovers. This evolved ketone synthase benefits from 15 crucial mutations, most of them distal to the active site. Computational analysis revealed that all these mutations collaborate to generate and tame a highly reactive carbocation intermediate. This is achieved through a confined, rigid, and geometrically and electrostatically preorganized active site. The engineered enzyme exploits a metal–oxo species for ketone synthesis and enables various challenging alkene functionalization reactions. This includes the catalytic, enantioselective oxidation of internal alkenes to ketones and formal asymmetric hydrofunctionalizations of internal alkenes in combination with other biocatalysts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cross‐linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) were prepared from several enzymes (penicillin G acylase, hydroxynitrile lyase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and two different nitrilases) by precipitation and subsequent cross‐linking using dextran polyaldehyde. In most cases, higher immobilization yields were obtained using the latter cross‐linker as compared with the commonly used glutaraldehyde. Active site titration of penicillin acylase CLEAs showed that the higher activity originated from a significantly lower loss in active sites using dextran polyaldehyde as a cross‐linking agent. It is proposed that macromolecular cross‐linkers are too large to penetrate the protein active site and react with catalytically essential amino acid residues. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Despite decades of research, no enzymes for the efficient hydrolysis of polyurethanes have been reported. Whereas the hydrolysis of the ester bonds in polyester‐polyurethanes by cutinases is known, the urethane bonds in polyether‐polyurethanes have remained inaccessible to biocatalytic hydrolysis. Here we report the discovery of urethanases from a metagenome library constructed from soil that had been exposed to polyurethane waste for many years. We then demonstrate the use of a urethanase in a chemoenzymatic process for polyurethane foam recycling. The urethanase hydrolyses low molecular weight dicarbamates resulting from chemical glycolysis of polyether‐polyurethane foam, making this strategy broadly applicable to diverse polyether‐polyurethane wastes.",

    "abstract": "Biocatalytic Boost Enzymes tend to direct reactions toward specific products much more selectively than synthetic catalysts. Unfortunately, this selectivity has evolved for cellular purposes and may not promote the sorts of reactions chemists are seeking to enhance (see the Perspective by Lutz ). Siegel et al. (p. 309 ) now describe the design of enzymes that catalyze the bimolecular Diels-Alder reaction, a carbon-carbon bond formation reaction that is central to organic synthesis but unknown in natural metabolism. The enzymes display high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity, and an x-ray structure of the most active enzyme confirms that the structure matches the design. Savile et al. (p. 305 , published online 17 June) applied a directed evolution approach to modify an existing transaminase enzyme so that it recognized a complex ketone in place of its smaller native substrate, and could tolerate the high temperature and organic cosolvent necessary to dissolve this ketone. This biocatalytic reaction improved the production efficiency of a drug that treats diabetes.",

    "title": "Many Pathways in Laboratory Evolution Can Lead to Improved Enzymes: How to Escape from Local Minima",
    "abstract": "Abstract Directed evolution is a method to tune the properties of enzymes for use in organic chemistry and biotechnology, to study enzyme mechanisms, and to shed light on Darwinian evolution in nature. In order to enhance its efficacy, iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) was implemented. This involves: 1) randomized mutation of appropriate sites of one or more residues; 2) screening of the initial mutant libraries for properties such as enzymatic rate, stereoselectivity, or thermal robustness; 3) use of the best hit in a given library as a template for saturation mutagenesis at the other sites; and 4) continuation of the process until the desired degree of enzyme improvement has been reached. Despite the success of a number of ISM‐based studies, the question of the optimal choice of the many different possible pathways remains unanswered. Here we considered a complete 4‐site ISM scheme. All 24 pathways were systematically explored, with the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger as the catalyst in the stereoselective hydrolytic kinetic resolution of a chiral epoxide. All 24 pathways were found to provide improved mutants with notably enhanced stereoselectivity. When a library failed to contain any hits, non‐improved or even inferior mutants were used as templates in the continuation of the evolutionary pathway, thereby escaping from the local minimum. These observations have ramifications for directed evolution in general and for evolutionary biological studies in which protein engineering techniques are applied.",

    "title": "An Enzymatic Route to α‐Tocopherol Synthons: Aromatic Hydroxylation of Pseudocumene and Mesitylene with P450 BM3",
    "abstract": "Abstract Aromatic hydroxylation of pseudocumene ( 1 a ) and mesitylene ( 1 b ) with P450 BM3 yields key phenolic building blocks for α‐tocopherol synthesis. The P450 BM3 wild‐type (WT) catalyzed selective aromatic hydroxylation of 1 b (94 %), whereas 1 a was hydroxylated to a large extent on benzylic positions (46–64 %). Site‐saturation mutagenesis generated a new P450 BM3 mutant, herein named “variant M3” (R47S, Y51W, A330F, I401M), with significantly increased coupling efficiency (3‐ to 8‐fold) and activity (75‐ to 230‐fold) for the conversion of 1 a and 1 b . Additional π–π interactions introduced by mutation A330F improved not only productivity and coupling efficiency, but also selectivity toward aromatic hydroxylation of 1 a (61 to 75 %). Under continuous nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate recycling, the novel P450 BM3 variant M3 was able to produce the key tocopherol precursor trimethylhydroquinone ( 3 a ; 35 % selectivity; 0.18 mg mL −1 ) directly from 1 a . In the case of 1 b , overoxidation leads to dearomatization and the formation of a valuable p ‐quinol synthon that can directly serve as an educt for the synthesis of 3 a . Detailed product pattern analysis, substrate docking, and mechanistic considerations support the hypothesis that 1 a binds in an inverted orientation in the active site of P450 BM3 WT, relative to P450 BM3 variant M3, to allow this change in chemoselectivity. This study provides an enzymatic route to key phenolic synthons for α‐tocopherols and the first catalytic and mechanistic insights into direct aromatic hydroxylation and dearomatization of trimethylbenzenes with O 2 .",

However, the number and diversity of the applications are modest, perhaps in part because of perceived or real limitations of biocatalysts, such as limited enzyme availability, substrate scope, and operational stability. Recent scientific breakthroughs in genomics, directed enzyme evolution, and the exploitation of biodiversity should help to overcome these limitations. As a result, we expect many new industrial applications of biocatalysis to be realized, from single-step enzymatic conversions to customized multistep microbial synthesis by means of metabolic pathway engineering.",

Important inherent properties of molecules need to be considered from the earliest stage—the design stage—to address whether compounds and processes are depleting versus renewable, toxic versus benign, and persistent versus readily degradable. Products, feedstocks, and manufacturing processes will need to integrate the principles of green chemistry and green engineering under an expanded definition of performance that includes sustainability considerations. This transformation will require the best of the traditions of science and innovation coupled with new emerging systems thinking and systems design that begins at the molecular level and results in a positive impact on the global scale.",

    "title": "The Emergence and Evolution of Organic Synthesis and Why It is Important to Sustain It as an Advancing Art and Science for Its Own Sake",
    "abstract": "Abstract Organic synthesis has been continuously evolving to higher levels of sophistication and into new domains ever since its emergence in the early part of the nineteenth century. Its impressive growth over the last two centuries parallels its enormous impact on science and society. Modern medicine, the dye industry, aromas and cosmetics, vitamins and nutritional goods, polymers and plastics, energy fuels and high‐tech materials are some of its direct benefits that shaped the world as we know it today. As an enabling science and technology organic synthesis has also impacted society indirectly by facilitating the birth and sustainability of other disciplines such as medicinal and process chemistry, chemical biology and biotechnology, physics and biology, and materials science and nanotechnology. It is, therefore, of paramount importance to champion and support the continuous advancement of the art and science of organic synthesis – both method development and total synthesis – for the magnitude of its impact on science and society is measured by its condition at any given time. As sharp as it is currently, its present state begs for more to be achieved in the future, for a comparison of its capabilities with those of Nature leaves us with awe for the latter and much to be desired for the former.",

In combination with glucose oxidase as oxygen‐activating biocatalyst, a purely enzymatic, aerobic protocol for the synthesis of 6‐hydroxypyranone building blocks is obtained. Thanks to an only modest stereochemical bias of the oxygenating heme protein, optically active alcohols of either configuration are converted without a significant mismatch opening up opportunities for enantioselective multienzymatic cascades. Balancing the oxidase‐driven aerobic activation, extended enzyme half‐lives and productive conversion of poorly soluble and slowly reacting substrates can be achieved with high yields of the six‐membered O‐heterocycles.",

    "title": "Evolved Aliphatic Halogenases Enable Regiocomplementary C−H Functionalization of a Pharmaceutically Relevant Compound",
    "abstract": "Abstract Non‐heme iron halogenases are synthetically valuable biocatalysts that are capable of halogenating unactivated sp 3 ‐hybridized carbon centers with high stereo‐ and regioselectivity. The reported substrate scope of these enzymes, however, is limited primarily to the natural substrates and their analogues. We engineered the halogenase WelO5* for chlorination of a martinelline‐derived fragment. Using structure‐guided evolution, a halogenase variant with a more than 290‐fold higher total turnover number and a 400‐fold higher apparent k cat compared to the wildtype enzyme was generated. Moreover, we identified key positions in the active site that allow direction of the halogen to different positions in the target substrate. This is the first example of enzyme engineering to expand the substrate scope of a non‐heme iron halogenase beyond the native indole‐alkaloid‐type substrates. The highly evolvable nature of WelO5* underscores the usefulness of this enzyme family for late‐stage halogenation.",

This transformation could be carried out in the presence of up to 20 g L −1 olefin substrate with no loss in diastereo‐ and/or enantioselectivity. Mutagenesis and mechanistic studies support a cyclopropanation mechanism mediated by an electrophilic, heme‐bound carbene species and a model is provided to rationalize the stereopreference of the protein catalyst. This work shows that myoglobin constitutes a promising and robust scaffold for the development of biocatalysts with carbene‐transfer reactivity.",

Furthermore, it was found that various amines enhance the reaction, whereby the effect do not seem to be correlated to the pH but to the structure of the donor.

    "abstract": "Abstract Phage display can be used as a protein‐engineering tool for the selection of proteins with desirable binding properties from a library of mutants. Here we describe the application of this method for the directed evolution of Bacillus subtilis lipase A, an enzyme that has important properties for the preparation of the pharmaceutically relevant chiral compound 1,2‐ O ‐isopropylidene‐ sn ‐glycerol (IPG). PCR mutagenesis with spiked oligonucleotides was employed for saturation mutagenesis of a stretch of amino acids near the active site. After expression of these mutants on bacteriophages, dual selection with ( S )‐(+)‐ and ( R )‐(−)‐IPG stereoisomers covalently coupled to enantiomeric phosphonate suicide inhibitors (SIRAN Sc and Rc inhibitors, respectively) was used for the isolation of variants with inverted enantioselectivity. The mutants were further characterised by determination of their Michaelis–Menten parameters. The 3D structures of the Sc and Rc inhibitor–lipase complexes were determined and provided structural insight into the mechanism of enantioselectivity of the enzyme. In conclusion, we have used phage display as a fast and reproducible method for the selection of Bacillus lipase A mutant enzymes with inverted enantioselectivity.",

In this context, enzymes capable of halogenating sp 3 carbons with high stereo- and regiocontrol under benign conditions have attracted particular attention. Enabled by a combination of smart library design and machine learning, we engineer the iron/α-ketoglutarate dependent halogenase WelO5* for the late-stage functionalization of the complex and chemically difficult to derivatize macrolides soraphen A and C, potent anti-fungal agents. While the wild type enzyme WelO5* does not accept the macrolide substrates, our engineering strategy leads to active halogenase variants and improves upon their apparent k cat and total turnover number by more than 90-fold and 300-fold, respectively. Notably, our machine-learning guided engineering approach is capable of predicting more active variants and allows us to switch the regio-selectivity of the halogenases facilitating the targeted analysis of the derivatized macrolides’ structure-function activity in biological assays.",

    "title": "Structural Analysis of an Evolved Transketolase Reveals Divergent Binding Modes",
    "abstract": "Abstract The S385Y/D469T/R520Q variant of E. coli transketolase was evolved previously with three successive smart libraries, each guided by different structural, bioinformatical or computational methods. Substrate-walking progressively shifted the target acceptor substrate from phosphorylated aldehydes, towards a non-phosphorylated polar aldehyde, a non-polar aliphatic aldehyde, and finally a non-polar aromatic aldehyde. Kinetic evaluations on three benzaldehyde derivatives, suggested that their active-site binding was differentially sensitive to the S385Y mutation. Docking into mutants generated in silico from the wild-type crystal structure was not wholly satisfactory, as errors accumulated with successive mutations, and hampered further smart-library designs. Here we report the crystal structure of the S385Y/D469T/R520Q variant, and molecular docking of three substrates. This now supports our original hypothesis that directed-evolution had generated an evolutionary intermediate with divergent binding modes for the three aromatic aldehydes tested. The new active site contained two binding pockets supporting π-π stacking interactions, sterically separated by the D469T mutation. While 3-formylbenzoic acid (3-FBA) preferred one pocket, and 4-FBA the other, the less well-accepted substrate 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde (3-HBA) was caught in limbo with equal preference for the two pockets. This work highlights the value of obtaining crystal structures of evolved enzyme variants, for continued and reliable use of smart library strategies.",

    "title": "Galaxy-SynBioCAD: Synthetic Biology Design Automation tools in Galaxy workflows",
    "abstract": "Abstract Many computer-aided design tools are available for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. Yet, these tools can be difficult to apprehend, sometimes requiring a level of expertise that limits their use by a wider community. Furthermore, some of the tools, although complementary, rely on different input and output formats and cannot communicate with one another. Scientific workflows address these shortcomings while offering a novel design strategy. Among the workflow systems available, Galaxy is a web-based platform for performing findable and accessible data analyses for all scientists regardless of their informatics expertise, along with interoperable and reproducible computations regardless of the particular platform that is being used. Here, we introduce the Galaxy-SynBioCAD a portal, the first Galaxy toolshed for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. It allows one to easily create workflows or use those already developed by the community. The portal is a growing community effort where developers can add new tools and users can evaluate the tools performing design for their specific projects. The tools and workflows currently shared on the Galaxy-SynBioCAD portal cover an end-to-end metabolic pathway design process from the selection of strain and target to the calculation of DNA parts to be assembled to build libraries of strains to be engineered to produce the target. Standard formats are used throughout to enforce the compatibility of the tools. These include SBML for strain and pathway and SBOL for genetic layouts. The portal has been benchmarked on 81 literature pathways, overall, we find we have a 65% (and 88%) success rate in retrieving the literature pathways among the top 10 (50) pathways predicted and generated by the workflows.",

In marked contrast to the variations observed with native CT, inhibition of CT immobilized on glass (CT–glass) was independent of the nature of the organic solvent. The overall activity, as indicated by k c (app)/k m (app), decreased by 35–50% as the concentration of all solvents surveyed was increased up to 20%. In general, high organic solvent concentration accelerated the rate of protein release from the insoluble catalyst. For practical applications in aqueous organic solvents CT–glass conjugates are inferior to those of the enzyme attached to Sephadex.",

In this work, we incorporated a range of proline analogues into the enzyme and examined the effects on structure and activity. While the structure of the enzyme remained unperturbed, its promiscuous Michael-type activity was severely affected. This finding demonstrates how atomic changes in a biocatalytic system can abolish its activity. Our work provides a toolbox for successful generation of enzyme variants with non-canonical catalytic proline analogues.",

For small scale and pilot productions, speed in process R&D, as well as the avoidance of scale‐up issues, are the main drivers. On the other hand, for large scale productions, a gain in yield and safety are the main motivations for the use of micoreactor technology. The gain in yield must be significant in order to cope with the increase in capital expenditure associated with the development of a new technology.",

    "abstract": "Biocatalysts represent an efficient, highly selective and greener alternative to metal catalysts in both industry and academia. In the last two decades, the interest in biocatalytic transformations has increased due to an urgent need for more sustainable industrial processes that comply with the principles of green chemistry. Thanks to the recent advances in biotechnologies, protein engineering and the Nobel prize awarded concept of direct enzymatic evolution, the synthetic enzymatic toolbox has expanded significantly. In particular, the implementation of biocatalysts in continuous flow systems has attracted much attention, especially from industry. The advantages of flow chemistry enable biosynthesis to overcome well-known limitations of “classic” enzymatic catalysis, such as time-consuming work-ups and enzyme inhibition, as well as difficult scale-up and process intensifications. Moreover, continuous flow biocatalysis provides access to practical, economical and more sustainable synthetic pathways, an important aspect for the future of pharmaceutical companies if they want to compete in the market while complying with European Medicines Agency (EMA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and green chemistry requirements. This review focuses on the most recent advances in the use of flow biocatalysis for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), pharmaceuticals and natural products, and the advantages and limitations are discussed.",

The first approach, “constrained hallucination,” optimizes sequences such that their predicted structures contain the desired functional site. The second approach, “inpainting,” starts from the functional site and fills in additional sequence and structure to create a viable protein scaffold in a single forward pass through a specifically trained RoseTTAFold network. We use these two methods to design candidate immunogens, receptor traps, metalloproteins, enzymes, and protein-binding proteins and validate the designs using a combination of in silico and experimental tests.",

    "abstract": "Increasing our understanding of Earth’s biodiversity and responsibly stewarding its resources are among the most crucial scientific and social challenges of the new millennium. These challenges require fundamental new knowledge of the organization, evolution, functions, and interactions among millions of the planet’s organisms. Herein, we present a perspective on the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), a moonshot for biology that aims to sequence, catalog, and characterize the genomes of all of Earth’s eukaryotic biodiversity over a period of 10 years. The outcomes of the EBP will inform a broad range of major issues facing humanity, such as the impact of climate change on biodiversity, the conservation of endangered species and ecosystems, and the preservation and enhancement of ecosystem services. We describe hurdles that the project faces, including data-sharing policies that ensure a permanent, freely available resource for future scientific discovery while respecting access and benefit sharing guidelines of the Nagoya Protocol. We also describe scientific and organizational challenges in executing such an ambitious project, and the structure proposed to achieve the project’s goals. The far-reaching potential benefits of creating an open digital repository of genomic information for life on Earth can be realized only by a coordinated international effort.",

    "title": "A roadmap for biocatalysis – functional and spatial orchestration of enzyme cascades",
    "abstract": "Summary Advances in biological engineering and systems biology have provided new approaches and tools for the industrialization of biology. In the next decade, advanced biocatalytic systems will increasingly be used for the production of chemicals that cannot be made by current processes and/or where the use of enzyme catalysts is more resource efficient with a much reduced environmental impact. We expect that in the future, manufacture of chemicals and materials will utilize both biocatalytic and chemical synthesis synergistically. The realization of such advanced biomanufacturing processes currently faces a number of major challenges. Ready‐to‐deploy portfolios of biocatalysts for design to production must be created from biological diverse sources and through protein engineering. Robust and efficient multi‐step enzymatic reaction cascades must be developed that can operate simultaneously in one‐pot. For this to happen, bio‐orthogonal strategies for spatial and temporal control of biocatalyst activities must be developed. Promising approaches and technologies are emerging that will eventually lead to the design of in vitro biocatalytic systems that mimic the metabolic pathways and networks of cellular systems which will be discussed in this roadmap.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Oxidation chemistry using enzymes is approaching maturity and practical applicability in organic synthesis. Oxidoreductases (enzymes catalysing redox reactions) enable chemists to perform highly selective and efficient transformations ranging from simple alcohol oxidations to stereoselective halogenations of non‐activated C−H bonds. For many of these reactions, no “classical” chemical counterpart is known. Hence oxidoreductases open up shorter synthesis routes based on a more direct access to the target products. The generally very mild reaction conditions may also reduce the environmental impact of biocatalytic reactions compared to classical counterparts. In this Review, we critically summarise the most important recent developments in the field of biocatalytic oxidation chemistry and identify the most pressing bottlenecks as well as promising solutions.",

A hitherto unprecedented carboxylic acid capping strategy was introduced to minimize the formation of the dead‐end intermediate 6‐hydroxyhexanoic acid. For this purpose, the precursor ε‐caprolactone was converted in aqueous medium in the presence of methanol into the corresponding methyl ester instead of the acid. Hence, it was shown for the first time that esterases—specifically horse liver esterase—can perform the selective ring‐opening of ε‐caprolactone with a clear preference for methanol over water as the nucleophile.",

For applications such as protein engineering and spatial transcriptomics that require either oligo pools or arrays with high sequence diversity, the EDS method needs to be adapted and certain steps in the synthesis process spatially decoupled. Here, we have used a synthesis cycle comprising a first step of site-specific silicon microelectromechanical system inkjet dispensing of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase enzyme and 3′ blocked nucleotide, and a second step of bulk slide washing to remove the 3′ blocking group. By repeating the cycle on a substrate with an immobilized DNA primer, we show that microscale spatial control of nucleic acid sequence and length is possible, which, here, are assayed by hybridization and gel electrophoresis. This work is distinctive for enzymatically synthesizing DNA in a highly parallel manner with single base control.",

Issues with their performance and specificity initially slowed the development of cell‐based biosensors. With the development of rational approaches to tune response curves, the performance of biosensors has rapidly improved and there are now many biosensors capable of sensing with the required performance. This has stimulated an increased interest in biosensors and their commercial potential. However the reliability, long term stability and biosecurity of these sensors are still barriers to commercial application and public acceptance. Research into overcoming these issues remains active. Here we present the state‐of‐the‐art tools offered by synthetic biology to allow construction of cell‐based biosensors with customisable performance to meet the real world requirements in terms of sensitivity and dynamic range and discuss the research progress to overcome the challenges in terms of the sensor stability and biosecurity fears.",

Despite recent advances in DNA sequencing, a lack of standardized protocols and common analytical frameworks impedes comparisons among studies, hindering the development of global inferences about microbial life on Earth. Here we present a meta-analysis of microbial community samples collected by hundreds of researchers for the Earth Microbiome Project. Coordinated protocols and new analytical methods, particularly the use of exact sequences instead of clustered operational taxonomic units, enable bacterial and archaeal ribosomal RNA gene sequences to be followed across multiple studies and allow us to explore patterns of diversity at an unprecedented scale. The result is both a reference database giving global context to DNA sequence data and a framework for incorporating data from future studies, fostering increasingly complete characterization of Earth’s microbial diversity.",

    "title": "Native lipase dissolved in hydrophilic green solvents: A versatile 2‐phase reaction system for high yield ester synthesis",
    "abstract": "Native lipase B from Candida antarctica was evaluated for ester production in the presence of hydrophilic green solvents including DES. Ester yields of up to 98% were achieved without removing water from the system in single step transformations. Analysis of the lipid phase exhibited a low water content of 0.29 mg/mL in the presence of DES in contrast to 2.5 mg/mL without solvent. Thus, water adsorbing properties of the hydrophilic solvents are responsible for the equilibrium shift towards ester synthesis, which was even observed in the presence of more than 20% water in total. Non‐immobilized CalB was surprisingly active in hydrophilic solvents with logP‐values below −1, when 5–10% water was added to the solvent phase and initial reaction velocities were significantly higher than with other organic solvents. Optimum reaction conditions were in the range of 40–50 °C with a minimum content of 50 mg/kg pure CalB needed for full conversion. The solvent phase was easily separated by decantation and final product purification with established refinement procedures yielded esters of high quality. Stability testing of soluble lipase B revealed that enzyme stability in glycerol and ChCl:Gly is exceptionally high and stabilization of lipase in denaturing ChCl:U was possible in the presence of a lipid interface. The hydrophilic solvents were superior to less polar organic solvents in regards to ester yield and initial reaction velocity. A drawback of some hydrophilic solvents in lipase‐catalyzed reactions is byproduct formation due to their chemical structure containing hydroxyl groups. Practical applications: The proposed biocatalytic process is suited for the preparation of green esters for cosmetic and technical applications in “low‐cost” production equipment. As no water removal is needed to obtain high yields and no complex downstream processing is applied, the process may be conducted in simple stirred tank reactors. The recycling of the non‐volatile hydrophilic solvent by example decantation can easily be done in most production units. The utilization of soluble lipases in small quantities even allows for single‐use enzyme application, though the active enzyme may be recovered with the solvent and used again to minimize catalyst costs. Lipase CalB is dissolved in the hydrophilic phase consisting of a hydrogen bonding network of solvent and water molecules. Lipase catalysis takes place at the solvent/lipid interface and water is adsorbed into the solvent phase, thus shifting the equilibrium towards ester formation in the water‐depleted lipid phase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solid reagents, leaching catalysts, and heterogeneous photocatalysts are commonly employed in batch processes but are ill‐suited for continuous‐flow chemistry. Heterogeneous catalysts for thermal reactions are typically used in packed‐bed reactors, which cannot be penetrated by light and thus are not suitable for photocatalytic reactions involving solids. We demonstrate that serial micro‐batch reactors (SMBRs) allow for the continuous utilization of solid materials together with liquids and gases in flow. This technology was utilized to develop selective and efficient fluorination reactions using a modified graphitic carbon nitride heterogeneous catalyst instead of costly homogeneous metal polypyridyl complexes. The merger of this inexpensive, recyclable catalyst and the SMBR approach enables sustainable and scalable photocatalysis.",

    "title": "Photobiocatalysis: Activating Redox Enzymes by Direct or Indirect Transfer of Photoinduced Electrons",
    "abstract": "Abstract Biocatalytic transformation has received increasing attention in the green synthesis of chemicals because of the diversity of enzymes, their high catalytic activities and specificities, and mild reaction conditions. The idea of solar energy utilization in chemical synthesis through the combination of photocatalysis and biocatalysis provides an opportunity to make the “green” process greener. Oxidoreductases catalyze redox transformation of substrates by exchanging electrons at the enzyme′s active site, often with the aid of electron mediator(s) as a counterpart. Recent progress indicates that photoinduced electron transfer using organic (or inorganic) photosensitizers can activate a wide spectrum of redox enzymes to catalyze fuel‐forming reactions (e.g., H 2 evolution, CO 2 reduction) and synthetically useful reductions (e.g., asymmetric reduction, oxygenation, hydroxylation, epoxidation, Baeyer–Villiger oxidation). This Review provides an overview of recent advances in light‐driven activation of redox enzymes through direct or indirect transfer of photoinduced electrons.",

    "abstract": "Riboswitches are common gene regulatory units mostly found in bacteria that are capable of altering gene expression in response to a small molecule. These structured RNA elements consist of two modular subunits: an aptamer domain that binds with high specificity and affinity to a target ligand and an expression platform that transduces ligand binding to a gene expression output. Significant progress has been made in engineering novel aptamer domains for new small molecule inducers of gene expression. Modified expression platforms have also been optimized to function when fused with both natural and synthetic aptamer domains. As this field expands, the use of these privileged scaffolds has permitted the development of tools such as RNA-based fluorescent biosensors. In this review, we summarize the methods that have been developed to engineer new riboswitches and highlight applications of natural and synthetic riboswitches in enzyme and strain engineering, in controlling gene expression and cellular physiology, and in real-time imaging of cellular metabolites and signals.",

    "title": "Stereoselective Hydrogenation of Olefins Using Rhodium‐Substituted Carbonic Anhydrase—A New Reductase",
    "abstract": "Abstract One useful synthetic reaction missing from nature's toolbox is the direct hydrogenation of substrates using hydrogen. Instead nature uses cofactors like NADH to reduce organic substrates, which adds complexity and cost to these reductions. To create an enzyme that can directly reduce organic substrates with hydrogen, researchers have combined metal hydrogenation catalysts with proteins. One approach is an indirect link where a ligand is linked to a protein and the metal binds to the ligand. Another approach is direct linking of the metal to protein, but nonspecific binding of the metal limits this approach. Herein, we report a direct hydrogenation of olefins catalyzed by rhodium(I) bound to carbonic anhydrase (CA‐[Rh]). We minimized nonspecific binding of rhodium by replacing histidine residues on the protein surface using site‐directed mutagenesis or by chemically modifying the histidine residues. Hydrogenation catalyzed by CA‐[Rh] is slightly slower than for uncomplexed rhodium(I), but the protein environment induces stereoselectivity favoring cis ‐ over trans ‐stilbene by about 20:1. This enzyme is the first cofactor‐independent reductase that reduces organic molecules using hydrogen. This catalyst is a good starting point to create variants with tailored reactivity and selectivity. This strategy to insert transition metals in the active site of metalloenzymes opens opportunities to a wider range of enzyme‐catalyzed reactions.",

    "title": "Hidden Conformations in <i>Aspergillus niger</i> Monoamine Oxidase are Key for Catalytic Efficiency",
    "abstract": "Abstract Enzymes exist as an ensemble of conformational states, whose populations can be shifted by substrate binding, allosteric interactions, but also by introducing mutations to their sequence. Tuning the populations of the enzyme conformational states through mutation enables evolution towards novel activity. Herein, Markov state models are used to unveil hidden conformational states of monoamine oxidase from Aspergillus niger (MAO‐N). These hidden conformations, not previously observed by any other technique, play a crucial role in substrate binding and enzyme activity. This reveals how distal mutations regulate MAO‐N activity by stabilizing these hidden, catalytically important conformational states, but also by modulating the communication pathway between both MAO‐N subunits.",

    "title": "Immobilization of thermophilic enzymes in miniaturized flow reactors",
    "abstract": "The exploitation of enzymes for biotransformation reactions for the production of new and safer drug intermediates has been the focus of much research. While a number of enzymes are commercially available, their use in an industrial setting is often limited to reactions that are cost-effective and they are rarely investigated further. However, the development of miniaturized flow reactor technology has meant that the cost of such research, once considered cost- and time-inefficient, would be much less prohibitive. The use of miniaturized flow reactors for enzyme screening offers a number of advantages over batch enzyme assay systems. Since the assay is performed on a miniaturized scale, enzyme, substrate and cofactor quantities are significantly reduced, thus reducing the cost of laboratory-scale investigations. Since flow reactors use microfluidic systems, where the substrate and products flow out of the system, the problems of substrate inhibition and product inhibition encountered by some enzymes are avoided. Quite often, enzymes fulfil a single-use function in biotransformation processes; however, enzyme immobilization allows enzyme reuse and often helps to increase enzyme stability. We have used an aminoacylase enzyme with potential use for industrial biotransformation reactions and have successfully immobilized it in miniaturized flow reactors. This L-aminoacylase is from the thermophilic archaeon Thermococcus litoralis. Two approaches to enzyme immobilization have been examined, both involving enzyme cross-linking. The first reactor type has used monoliths, to which the enzyme was attached, and the second contained previously cross-linked enzyme trapped using frits, in the microfluidic channels. Two different microreactor designs were used in the investigation: microreactor chips for the monoliths and capillary flow reactors for the cross-linked enzyme. These systems allowed passage of the substrate and product through the system while retaining the aminoacylase enzyme performing the catalytic conversion. The enzyme has been successfully immobilized and used to produce stable biocatalytic microreactors that can be used repeatedly over a period of several months.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Directed evolution has long been a key strategy to generate enzymes with desired properties like high selectivity, but experimental barriers and analytical costs of screening enormous mutant libraries have limited such efforts. Here, we describe an ultrahigh-throughput dual-channel microfluidic droplet screening system that can be used to screen up to ~10 7 enzyme variants per day. As an example case, we use the system to engineer the enantioselectivity of an esterase to preferentially produce desired enantiomers of profens, an important class of anti-inflammatory drugs. Using two types of screening working modes over the course of five rounds of directed evolution, we identify (from among 5 million mutants) a variant with 700-fold improved enantioselectivity for the desired ( S )-profens. We thus demonstrate that this screening platform can be used to rapidly generate enzymes with desired enzymatic properties like enantiospecificity, chemospecificity, and regiospecificity.",

Even though this has led to numerous scientific breakthroughs, the enclosed interior of bacterial cells still restricts interactions with enzymes, pathways and products due to the mass-transfer barrier formed by the cell envelope. To promote accessibility, we propose engineering of biocatalytic reactions and subsequent product deposition directly on the bacterial surface. As a proof-of-concept, we used the AIDA autotransporter vehicle for Escherichia coli surface expression of tyrosinase and fully oxidized externally added tyrosine to the biopolymer melanin. This resulted in a color change and creation of a black cell exterior. The capture of ninety percent of a pharmaceutical wastewater pollutant followed by regeneration of the cell bound melanin matrix through a simple pH change, shows the superior function and facilitated processing provided by the surface methodology. The broad adsorption spectrum of melanin could also allow removal of other micropollutants.",

The key part of the synthesis is based on a one‐pot /two‐enzyme process whereby three reactions take place; rabbit muscle aldolase (RAMA) catalyzed aldolization, phytase‐catalyzed phosphate hydrolysis, and intramolecular spontaneous nitroaldolization. Two families of nitrocyclitols were obtained depending on the carbon configuration in the β position to the nitro group. Reduction of the latter afforded the aminocyclitols. Evaluation of the inhibition properties of the amines towards five commercially available glycosidases has shown selectivity for β‐glucosidase and β‐galactosidase.",

    "title": "Recent Developments in Chemical Synthesis with Biocatalysts in Ionic Liquids",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, a variety of ionic liquids have emerged as greener solvents for use in the chemical manufacturing industries. Their unique properties have attracted the interest of chemists worldwide to employ them as replacement for conventional solvents in a diverse range of chemical transformations including biotransformations. Biocatalysts are often regarded as green catalysts compared to conventional chemical catalysts in organic synthesis owing to their properties of low toxicity, biodegradability, excellent selectivity and good catalytic performance under mild reaction conditions. Similarly, a selected number of specific ionic liquids can be considered as greener solvents superior to organic solvents owing to their negligible vapor pressure, low flammability, low toxicity and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic and biological substances, including proteins. A combination of biocatalysts and ionic liquids thus appears to be a logical and promising opportunity for industrial use as an alternative to conventional organic chemistry processes employing organic solvents. This article provides an overview of recent developments in this field with special emphasis on the application of more sustainable enzyme-catalyzed reactions and separation processes employing ionic liquids, driven by advances in fundamental knowledge, process optimization and industrial deployment.",

However, most of these tools cannot accurately predict functional annotations, such as enzyme commission (EC) number, for less-studied proteins or those with previously uncharacterized functions or multiple activities. We present a machine learning algorithm named CLEAN (contrastive learning–enabled enzyme annotation) to assign EC numbers to enzymes with better accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity compared with the state-of-the-art tool BLASTp. The contrastive learning framework empowers CLEAN to confidently (i) annotate understudied enzymes, (ii) correct mislabeled enzymes, and (iii) identify promiscuous enzymes with two or more EC numbers—functions that we demonstrate by systematic in silico and in vitro experiments. We anticipate that this tool will be widely used for predicting the functions of uncharacterized enzymes, thereby advancing many fields, such as genomics, synthetic biology, and biocatalysis.",

    "title": "Genetic Modification of the Penicillin G Acylase Surface To Improve Its Reversible Immobilization on Ionic Exchangers",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A new mutant of the industrial enzyme penicillin G acylase (PGA) from Escherichia coli has been designed to improve its reversible immobilization on anionic exchangers (DEAE- or polyethyleneimine [PEI]-coated agarose) by assembling eight new glutamic residues distributed homogeneously through the enzyme surface via site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant PGA is produced and processed in vivo as is the native enzyme. Moreover, it has a similar specific activity to and shows the same pH activity profile as native PGA; however, its isoelectric point decreased from 6.4 to 4.3. Although the new enzyme is adsorbed on both supports, the adsorption was even stronger when supports were coated with PEI, allowing us to improve the enzyme stability in organic cosolvents. The use of restrictive conditions during the enzyme adsorption on anionic exchangers (pH 5 and high ionic strength) permitted us to still further increase the strength of adsorption and the enzyme stability in the presence of organic solvents, suggesting that these conditions allow the penetration of the enzyme inside the polymeric beds, thus becoming fully covered with the polymer. After the enzyme inactivation, it can be desorbed to reuse the support. The possibility to improve the immobilization properties on an enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis of its surface opens a promising new scenario for enzyme engineering.",

    "title": "Asymmetric Amination of Secondary Alcohols by using a Redox‐Neutral Two‐Enzyme Cascade",
    "abstract": "Abstract Multienzyme cascade approaches for the synthesis of optically pure molecules from simple achiral compounds are desired. Herein, a cofactor self‐sufficient cascade protocol for the asymmetric amination of racemic secondary alcohols to the corresponding chiral amines was successfully constructed by employing an alcohol dehydrogenase and a newly developed amine dehydrogenase. The compatibility and the identical cofactor dependence of the two enzymes led to an ingenious in situ cofactor recycling system in the one‐pot synthesis. The artificial redox‐neutral cascade process allowed the transformation of racemic secondary alcohols into enantiopure amines with considerable conversions (up to 94 %) and >99 % enantiomeric excess at the expense of only ammonia; this method thus represents a concise and efficient route for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract En route to a bio-based chemical industry, the conversion of fatty acids into building blocks is of particular interest. Enzymatic routes, occurring under mild conditions and excelling by intrinsic selectivity, are particularly attractive. Here we report photoenzymatic cascade reactions to transform unsaturated fatty acids into enantiomerically pure secondary fatty alcohols. In a first step the C=C-double bond is stereoselectively hydrated using oleate hydratases from Lactobacillus reuteri or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia . Also, dihydroxylation mediated by the 5,8-diol synthase from Aspergillus nidulans is demonstrated. The second step comprises decarboxylation of the intermediate hydroxy acids by the photoactivated decarboxylase from Chlorella variabilis NC64A. A broad range of (poly)unsaturated fatty acids can be transformed into enantiomerically pure fatty alcohols in a simple one-pot approach.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A short and efficient total synthesis of the alkaloid isosolenopsin and its enantiomer has been achieved. The key step was a ω‐transaminase‐catalysed regioselective monoamination of the diketone pentadecane‐2,6‐dione, which was obtained in a single step through the application of a Grignard reaction. Initial low conversions in the biotransformation could be overcome by optimisation of the reaction conditions employing suitable cosolvents. In the presence of 20 vol.‐% N , N ‐dimethylformamide (DMF) or n ‐heptane the best results were obtained by employing two enantiocomplementary ω‐transaminases originating from Arthrobacter at 30–40 °C; under these conditions, conversions of more than 99 % and perfect stereocontrol ( ee > 99 %) were achieved. Diastereoselective chemical reduction (H 2 /Pd/C) of the biocatalytic product gave the target compound. The linear three‐step synthesis provided the natural product isosolenopsin in diastereomerically pure form ( ee > 99 %, dr = 99:1) with an overall yield of 64 %.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Certain hydrolases preferentially catalyze acyl transfer over hydrolysis in an aqueous environment. However, the molecular and structural reasons for this phenomenon are still unclear. Herein, we provide evidence that acyltransferase activity in esterases highly correlates with the hydrophobicity of the substrate‐binding pocket. A hydrophobicity scoring system developed in this work allows accurate prediction of promiscuous acyltransferase activity solely from the amino acid sequence of the cap domain. This concept was experimentally verified by systematic investigation of several homologous esterases, leading to the discovery of five novel promiscuous acyltransferases. We also developed a simple yet versatile colorimetric assay for rapid characterization of novel acyltransferases. This study demonstrates that promiscuous acyltransferase activity is not as rare as previously thought and provides access to a vast number of novel acyltransferases with diverse substrate specificity and potential applications.",

    "title": "Simultaneous detection of three sex steroid hormone classes using a novel yeast‐based biosensor",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A biosensor detecting estrogens, progestogens, and androgens in complex samples and in a single step is described. Three Arxula adeninivorans yeast strains were created, each strain producing a different recombinant human hormone receptor and a different fluorescent reporter protein. These strains were then mixed to create G1212/YRC102‐hHR‐fluo, the biological component of the biosensor. During incubation with G1212/YRC102‐hHR‐fluo, hormones present in a sample bind to their target receptor, which leads to the production of a specific fluorescent protein. Three fluorescence scans of the yeast suspension determine which fluorescence protein has been produced, thus revealing which hormone receptor (estrogen, progesterone, and androgen) has been activated by the hormones or hormone mimics present in the sample. The biosensor has similar sensitivities to the existing A. adeninivorans cell‐based assays. The detection of the three hormone classes in one single experiment reduces the labor and time required to assay for the three hormone classes. The biosensor was also trialed with animal serum samples for the detection of progestogens, androgens, and estrogens and gave results that correlated well with ELISA analysis in case of progestogens. These results highlight the potential usefulness of the biosensor for comprehensive determination of hormone status in samples from veterinary origin. Biotechnol.

Combinatorial sequence space can be quite expensive to sample experimentally, but machine-learning models trained on tested variants provide a fast method for testing sequence space computationally. We validated this approach on a large published empirical fitness landscape for human GB1 binding protein, demonstrating that machine learning-guided directed evolution finds variants with higher fitness than those found by other directed evolution approaches. We then provide an example application in evolving an enzyme to produce each of the two possible product enantiomers (i.e., stereodivergence) of a new-to-nature carbene Si–H insertion reaction. The approach predicted libraries enriched in functional enzymes and fixed seven mutations in two rounds of evolution to identify variants for selective catalysis with 93% and 79% ee (enantiomeric excess). By greatly increasing throughput with in silico modeling, machine learning enhances the quality and diversity of sequence solutions for a protein engineering problem.",

The third enzyme was hydantoin racemase 1 for the first system and hydantoin racemase 2 for the second system, both from A. tumefaciens C58. Each system was formed by using a recombinant Escherichia coli strain with one plasmid harboring three genes coexpressed with one promoter in a polycistronic structure. The d -carbamoylase gene was cloned closest to the promoter in order to obtain the highest level of synthesis of the enzyme, thus avoiding intermediate accumulation, which decreases the reaction rate.

OYEs’ dependency on the pyridine nucleotide coenzyme can be circumvented through established artificial hydride donors such as nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics (NCBs). Several OYEs were found to exhibit higher reduction rates with NCBs. In this review, we describe a new classification of OYEs into three main classes by phylogenetic and structural analysis of characterized OYEs. The family roots are linked with their use as chiral catalysts and their mode of action with NCBs. The link between bioinformatics (sequence analysis), biochemistry (structure–function analysis), and biocatalysis (conversion, enantioselectivity and kinetics) can enable an early classification of a putative ene-reductase and therefore the indication of the binding mode of various activated alkenes.",

Looking forward, continued bioinformatic sourcing will help identify additional, practical useful members of this intriguing enzyme family, while enzyme engineering will pave the way to enhance 2OGX reactivity for non-native substrates.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic oligonucleotides have emerged as a powerful drug modality with the potential to treat a wide range of diseases; however, the rising number of therapies poses a manufacturing challenge. Existing synthetic methods use stepwise extension of sequences immobilized on solid supports and are limited by their scalability and sustainability. We report a biocatalytic approach to efficiently produce oligonucleotides in a single operation where polymerases and endonucleases work in synergy to amplify complementary sequences embedded within catalytic self-priming templates. This approach uses unprotected building blocks and aqueous conditions. We demonstrate the versatility of this methodology through the synthesis of clinically relevant oligonucleotide sequences containing diverse modifications.",

    "title": "ROSETTALIGAND: Protein–small molecule docking with full side‐chain flexibility",
    "abstract": "Abstract Protein–small molecule docking algorithms provide a means to model the structure of protein–small molecule complexes in structural detail and play an important role in drug development. In recent years the necessity of simulating protein side‐chain flexibility for an accurate prediction of the protein–small molecule interfaces has become apparent, and an increasing number of docking algorithms probe different approaches to include protein flexibility. Here we describe a new method for docking small molecules into protein binding sites employing a Monte Carlo minimization procedure in which the rigid body position and orientation of the small molecule and the protein side‐chain conformations are optimized simultaneously. The energy function comprises van der Waals (VDW) interactions, an implicit solvation model, an explicit orientation hydrogen bonding potential, and an electrostatics model. In an evaluation of the scoring function the computed energy correlated with experimental small molecule binding energy with a correlation coefficient of 0.63 across a diverse set of 229 protein– small molecule complexes. The docking method produced lowest energy models with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) smaller than 2 Å in 71 out of 100 protein–small molecule crystal structure complexes (self‐docking). In cross‐docking calculations in which both protein side‐chain and small molecule internal degrees of freedom were varied the lowest energy predictions had RMSDs less than 2 Å in 14 of 20 test cases.

    "title": "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold",
    "abstract": "Abstract Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort 1–4 , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined 5 , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences 6,7 . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’ 8 —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years 9 . Despite recent progress 10–14 , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 15 , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The performance of lipases from Candida rugosa and wheat germ have been investigated in three reaction media using three acetate hydrolyses as model reactions (ethyl acetate, allyl acetate, and prenyl acetate). The effect of substrate properties and water content were studied for each system (organic solvent, biphasic system, and reverse micelles). Not unexpectedly, the effect of water content is distinct for each system, and the optimal water content for enzyme activity is not always the same as that for productivity. A theoretical model has been used to simulate and predict enzyme performance in reverse micelles, and a proposed partitioning model for biphasic systems agrees well with experimental results. While the highest activities observed were in the micellar system, productivity in microemulsions is limited by low enzyme concentrations. Biphasic systems, however, support relatively good activity and productivity. The addition of water to dry organic solvents, combined with the dispersion of lyophilized enzyme powders in the solvent, resulted in significant enzyme aggregation, which not surprisingly limits the applicability of the “anhydrous” enzyme suspension approach. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "title": "Organic solvents strip water off enzymes",
    "abstract": "Abstract Exchange of enzyme‐bound H 2 O with T 2 O in aqueous solution followed by freeze drying provided tritiated water bound to chymotrypsin, subtilisin Carlsberg, and horseradish peroxidase. The desorption of T 2 O from these enzymes suspended in various organic solvents showed that all three enzymes lost enzyme‐bound water with peroxidase losing the most T 2 O of the three in solvents of moderate to high polarity. Polar solvent resulted in the highest degree of T 2 O desorption (e.g., methanol desorbed from 56%‐62% of the bound T 2 O), while nonpolar solvents resulted in the lowest degree of desorption (e.g., hexane desorbed from 0.4%–2% of the bound T 2 O). Desorption is nearly immediate with most of the desorbable T 2 O being released from the enzymes within the first 5 min. Both solvent dielectric and a measure of the saturated molar solubility of water in a given solvent provide accurate correlations between the properties of the organic solvents and the extent of T 2 O desorption. This investigation shows that water stripping from an enzyme into a nonaqueous medium does occur and can be significant in polar solvents.",

    "title": "Using mutability landscapes of a promiscuous tautomerase to guide the engineering of enantioselective Michaelases",
    "abstract": "Abstract The Michael-type addition reaction is widely used in organic synthesis for carbon–carbon bond formation. However, biocatalytic methodologies for this type of reaction are scarce, which is related to the fact that enzymes naturally catalysing carbon–carbon bond-forming Michael-type additions are rare. A promising template to develop new biocatalysts for carbon–carbon bond formation is the enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, which exhibits promiscuous Michael-type addition activity. Here we present mutability landscapes for the expression, tautomerase and Michael-type addition activities, and enantioselectivity of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. These maps of neutral, beneficial and detrimental amino acids for each residue position and enzyme property provide detailed insight into sequence–function relationships. This offers exciting opportunities for enzyme engineering, which is illustrated by the redesign of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase into two enantiocomplementary ‘Michaelases’. These ‘Michaelases’ catalyse the asymmetric addition of acetaldehyde to various nitroolefins, providing access to both enantiomers of γ-nitroaldehydes, which are important precursors for pharmaceutically active γ-aminobutyric acid derivatives.",

The ability to design a new protein fold makes possible the exploration of the large regions of the protein universe not yet observed in nature.",

    "title": "Particle‐tethered NADH for production of methanol from CO<sub>2</sub> catalyzed by coimmobilized enzymes",
    "abstract": "Abstract Efficient cofactor regeneration and reuse are highly desired for many important biotransformation applications. Here we show for the first time that cofactor NAD(H) covalently attached to micro particles, which can be easily recovered and reused, effectively mediated multistep reactions catalyzed by enzymes that were also immobilized with the micro particles. Such an immobilized enzyme‐cofactor catalytic system was examined for the production of methanol from CO 2 with in situ cofactor regeneration. Four enzymes including formate, formaldehyde, alcohol, and glutamate dehydrogenases were coimmobilized using the same particles as that used for cofactor immobilization (enzymes and cofactor were immobilized separately). Reactions were performed by bubbling CO 2 in a suspension solution of the particle‐attached enzymes and cofactor. It appeared that the collision among the particles afforded sufficient interactions between the cofactor and enzymes, and thus enabled the sequential transformation of CO 2 to methanol along with cofactor regeneration. For a 30‐min batch reaction, a productivity of 0.02 µmol methanol/h/g‐enzyme was achieved. That was lower than but comparable to the 0.04 µmol methanol/h/g‐enzyme observed for free enzymes and cofactor at the same reaction conditions. The immobilized system showed fairly good stabilities in reusing. Over 80% of their original productivity was retained after 11 reusing cycles, with a cumulative methanol yield based on the amount of cofactor reached 127%. That was a promising enhancement in cofactor utilization as compared to the single‐batch yield of 12% observed with free enzymes and free cofactor. Biotechnol.

    "abstract": "Abstract The biological potency of natural products has been exploited for decades. Their inherent structural complexity and natural diversity might hold the key to efficiently address the urgent need for the development of novel pharmaceuticals. At the same time, it is that very complexity, which impedes necessary chemical modifications such as structural diversification, to improve the effectiveness of the drug. For this purpose, Cytochrome P450 enzymes, which possess unique abilities to activate inert sp 3 ‐hybridised C−H bonds in a late‐stage fashion, offer an attractive synthetic tool. In this review the potential of cytochrome P450 enzymes in chemoenzymatic lead diversification is illustrated discussing studies reporting late‐stage functionalisations of natural products and other high‐value compounds. These enzymes were proven to extend the synthetic toolbox significantly by adding to the flexibility and efficacy of synthetic strategies of natural product chemists, and scientists of other related disciplines.",

Unfortunately, this selectivity has evolved for cellular purposes and may not promote the sorts of reactions chemists are seeking to enhance (see the Perspective by Lutz ). Siegel et al. (p. 309 ) now describe the design of enzymes that catalyze the bimolecular Diels-Alder reaction, a carbon-carbon bond formation reaction that is central to organic synthesis but unknown in natural metabolism. The enzymes display high stereoselectivity and substrate specificity, and an x-ray structure of the most active enzyme confirms that the structure matches the design. Savile et al. (p. 305 , published online 17 June) applied a directed evolution approach to modify an existing transaminase enzyme so that it recognized a complex ketone in place of its smaller native substrate, and could tolerate the high temperature and organic cosolvent necessary to dissolve this ketone. This biocatalytic reaction improved the production efficiency of a drug that treats diabetes.",

Each step occurs in over 95% yield and only utilizes widely available commodity reagents and simple operations. Compared to the initial route, the new route is 70% shorter, and approximately seven-fold higher in overall yield.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The development of novel enzymes for biocatalytic processes requires knowledge on substrate profile and selectivity; this can be derived from databases and from publications. Often, these sources lack time‐course data for the substrate or product, and an unambiguous link between experiment and enzyme sequence. The lack of integrated, original data hampers the comprehensive analysis of enzyme kinetics and the evaluation of sequence–function relationships. In order to accelerate enzyme engineering, BioCatNet integrates protein sequence, protein structure, and experimental data for a given enzyme family. BioCatNet explicitly assigns the enzyme sequence to the experimental data, which consists of information on reaction conditions and time‐course data. BioCatNet facilitates the consistent documentation of reaction conditions, the archiving of time‐course data, and the efficient exchange of experimental data among collaborators. Data integration is demonstrated for three case studies by using the TEED (Thiamine diphosphate‐dependent Enzymes Engineering Database).",

    "title": "Biocatalysis and biomass conversion: enabling a circular economy",
    "abstract": "This paper is based on a lecture presented to the Royal Society in London on 24 June 2019. Two of the grand societal and technological challenges of the twenty-first century are the ‘greening' of chemicals manufacture and the ongoing transition to a sustainable, carbon neutral economy based on renewable biomass as the raw material, a so-called bio-based economy. These challenges are motivated by the need to eliminate environmental degradation and mitigate climate change. In a bio-based economy, ideally waste biomass, particularly agricultural and forestry residues and food supply chain waste, are converted to liquid fuels, commodity chemicals and biopolymers using clean, catalytic processes. Biocatalysis has the right credentials to achieve this goal. Enzymes are biocompatible, biodegradable and essentially non-hazardous. Additionally, they are derived from inexpensive renewable resources which are readily available and not subject to the large price fluctuations which undermine the long-term commercial viability of scarce precious metal catalysts. Thanks to spectacular advances in molecular biology the landscape of biocatalysis has dramatically changed in the last two decades. Developments in (meta)genomics in combination with ‘big data’ analysis have revolutionized new enzyme discovery and developments in protein engineering by directed evolution have enabled dramatic improvements in their performance. These developments have their confluence in the bio-based circular economy. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Science to enable the circular economy'.",

    "abstract": "Lipases are a group of enzymes naturally endowed with the property of performing reactions in aqueous as well as organic solvents. The esterification reactions using lipase(s) could be performed in water-restricted organic media as organic solvent(s) not only improve(s) the solubility of substrate and reactant in reaction mixture but also permit(s) the reaction in the reverse direction, and often it is easy to recover the product in organic phase in two-phase equilibrium systems. The use of organic solvent tolerant lipase in organic media has exhibited many advantages: increased activity and stability, regiospecificity and stereoselectivity, higher solubility of substrate, ease of products recovery, and ability to shift the reaction equilibrium toward synthetic direction. Therefore the search for organic solvent tolerant enzymes has been an extensive area of research. A variety of fatty acid esters are now being produced commercially using immobilized lipase in nonaqueous solvents. This review describes the organic tolerance and industrial application of lipases. The main emphasis is to study the nature of organic solvent tolerant lipases. Also, the potential industrial applications that make lipases the biocatalysts of choice for the present and future have been presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Inspired by the successful work of converting Saccharomyces cerevisiae into an microorganism capable of synthesizing hydrocortisone, a 27‐carbon molecule, from ethanol, a 2‐carbon molecule, this review provides an overview of the potential of yeast as a recombinant organism in the 21st century. Yeast has been used by man for more than 6000 years, and is still paving the way to new discoveries. It was the first eukaryotic organism to be sequenced, in 1996, and the first to produce hydrocortisone in 2003. In addition, extensive genome–wide analyses have been performed with yeast. In this review, we discuss the pros and cons of using yeast to produce small therapeutic molecules. It is obvious that S. cerevisiae has a cutting edge advantage of being a well–known organism and time will tell if yeast “biohydrocortisone” is a unique example or the beginning of a long list of yeast bioproducts. Other organisms, such as plants and bacteria, are competing with yeast. Bacteria produce a wealth of marketed molecules and plants are capable of producing extremely complex molecules with an unbeatable yield. However, S. cerevisiae offers a unique mix of the simplicity of a recombinant organism combined with the complexity of a eukaryote.",

Understanding how proper function is achieved at the atomic level is crucial to advancing multiple avenues of biomedical research. Biophysical studies often include X-ray diffraction and cryo–electron microscopy, providing detailed structural descriptions of these machines. However, their inherent flexibility has complicated an understanding of the relation between structure and function. Solution NMR spectroscopy is well suited to the study of such dynamic complexes, and continued developments have increased size boundaries; insights into function have been obtained for complexes with masses as large as 1 MDa. We highlight methyl-TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) NMR, which enables the study of such large systems, and include examples of applications to several cellular machines. We show how this emerging technique contributes to an understanding of cellular function and the role of molecular plasticity in regulating an array of biochemical activities.",

    "title": "Metabolic Engineering of Poly(3-Hydroxyalkanoates): From DNA to Plastic",
    "abstract": "SUMMARY Poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) are a class of microbially produced polyesters that have potential applications as conventional plastics, specifically thermoplastic elastomers. A wealth of biological diversity in PHA formation exists, with at least 100 different PHA constituents and at least five different dedicated PHA biosynthetic pathways. This diversity, in combination with classical microbial physiology and modern molecular biology, has now opened up this area for genetic and metabolic engineering to develop optimal PHA-producing organisms. Commercial processes for PHA production were initially developed by W. R. Grace in the 1960s and later developed by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s. Since the early 1990s, Metabolix Inc. and Monsanto have been the driving forces behind the commercial exploitation of PHA polymers in the United States. The gram-negative bacterium Ralstonia eutropha, formerly known as Alcaligenes eutrophus, has generally been used as the production organism of choice, and intracellular accumulation of PHA of over 90% of the cell dry weight have been reported. The advent of molecular biological techniques and a developing environmental awareness initiated a renewed scientific interest in PHAs, and the biosynthetic machinery for PHA metabolism has been studied in great detail over the last two decades. Because the structure and monomeric composition of PHAs determine the applications for each type of polymer, a variety of polymers have been synthesized by cofeeding of various substrates or by metabolic engineering of the production organism. Classical microbiology and modern molecular bacterial physiology have been brought together to decipher the intricacies of PHA metabolism both for production purposes and for the unraveling of the natural role of PHAs. This review provides an overview of the different PHA biosynthetic systems and their genetic background, followed by a detailed summation of how this natural diversity is being used to develop commercially attractive, recombinant processes for the large-scale production of PHAs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence-based protein structure prediction approaches have had a transformative effect on biomolecular sciences. The predicted protein models in the AlphaFold protein structure database, however, all lack coordinates for small molecules, essential for molecular structure or function: hemoglobin lacks bound heme; zinc-finger motifs lack zinc ions essential for structural integrity and metalloproteases lack metal ions needed for catalysis. Ligands important for biological function are absent too; no ADP or ATP is bound to any of the ATPases or kinases. Here we present AlphaFill, an algorithm that uses sequence and structure similarity to ‘transplant’ such ‘missing’ small molecules and ions from experimentally determined structures to predicted protein models. The algorithm was successfully validated against experimental structures. A total of 12,029,789 transplants were performed on 995,411 AlphaFold models and are available together with associated validation metrics in the alphafill.eu databank, a resource to help scientists make new hypotheses and design targeted experiments.",

    "title": "Engineering tunable biosensors for monitoring putrescine in <i>Escherichia coli</i>",
    "abstract": "Abstract Biosensors can be a powerful tool for real‐time monitoring of specific small molecules and for precise control of gene expression in biological systems. Thus, biosensors have attracted much attention for monitoring increasing number of molecules. However, strategies to tune the properties of biosensors remain less explored, which might restrict their wide applicability. Here we report the development of tunable biosensors for monitoring putrescine, an important member of biological polyamines, in Escherichia coli . The native putrescine‐responsive PuuR repressor protein was employed as a sensing component, and its cognate operator was installed in engineered promoters to control the expression of downstream green fluorescent protein (GFP) mut3 as a reporter protein. The engineered biosensors were specific for putrescine, and the response time could be modulated by altering growth medium of the biosensor strains. In addition, the response dynamics and detection ranges of the biosensors can be tuned at the genetic level by modulation of PuuR expression, and by manipulation of the chromosomal genes involved in putrescine biosynthesis. To demonstrate utility of the biosensors, we were able to monitor the changes of endogenous putrescine levels caused by genetic manipulations. Furthermore, a link between the excretory putrescine titer and intracellular GFP fluorescence was established for an E. coli strain that was engineered for improved putrescine biosynthesis and excretion. This study provides a strategy for engineering synthetic biosensor circuit for monitoring and tuning the dynamics in sensing putrescine, which can be generally applicable for monitoring other chemicals through taking a similar approach in circuit design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Engineered hemoproteins have recently emerged as promising systems for promoting asymmetric cyclopropanations, but variants featuring predictable, complementary stereoselectivity in these reactions have remained elusive. In this study, a rationally driven strategy was implemented and applied to engineer myoglobin variants capable of providing access to 1‐carboxy‐2‐aryl‐cyclopropanes with high trans‐(1R,2R) selectivity and catalytic activity. The stereoselectivity of these cyclopropanation biocatalysts complements that of trans‐(1S,2S)‐selective variants developed here and previously. In combination with whole‐cell biotransformations, these stereocomplementary biocatalysts enabled the multigram synthesis of the chiral cyclopropane core of four drugs (Tranylcypromine, Tasimelteon, Ticagrelor, and a TRPV1 inhibitor) in high yield and with excellent diastereo‐ and enantioselectivity (98–99.9% de; 96–99.9% ee). These biocatalytic strategies outperform currently available methods to produce these drugs.",

    "title": "Biocatalyzed Synthesis of Statins: A Sustainable Strategy for the Preparation of Valuable Drugs",
    "abstract": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are the largest selling class of drugs prescribed for the pharmacological treatment of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidaemia. Statins also possess other therapeutic effects, called pleiotropic, because the blockade of the conversion of HMG-CoA to (R)-mevalonate produces a concomitant inhibition of the biosynthesis of numerous isoprenoid metabolites (e.g., geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) or farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)). Thus, the prenylation of several cell signalling proteins (small GTPase family members: Ras, Rac, and Rho) is hampered, so that these molecular switches, controlling multiple pathways and cell functions (maintenance of cell shape, motility, factor secretion, differentiation, and proliferation) are regulated, leading to beneficial effects in cardiovascular health, regulation of the immune system, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties, prevention and treatment of sepsis, treatment of autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, kidney and neurological disorders, or even in cancer therapy. Thus, there is a growing interest in developing more sustainable protocols for preparation of statins, and the introduction of biocatalyzed steps into the synthetic pathways is highly advantageous—synthetic routes are conducted under mild reaction conditions, at ambient temperature, and can use water as a reaction medium in many cases. Furthermore, their high selectivity avoids the need for functional group activation and protection/deprotection steps usually required in traditional organic synthesis. Therefore, biocatalysis provides shorter processes, produces less waste, and reduces manufacturing costs and environmental impact. In this review, we will comment on the pleiotropic effects of statins and will illustrate some biotransformations nowadays implemented for statin synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We have achieved significant improvements in the synthesis of poly(sucrose acrylate). A screen of 15 commercial enzymes was carried out and Alcalase 2T was selected as the best enzyme because of its high activity and selectivity for acylation of sucrose at only one site. The rate of the enzyme catalyzed acylation of sucrose to form sucrose 1'‐acrylate was increased by a factor of ca. 100 compared to previous reports. This rate was increased 10‐fold by treating the as received enzyme by adjusting the pH to the optimum value for the enzyme. An additional 10‐fold increase was achieved by adding a lyoprotectant such as sucrose or poly(ethylene glycol) prior to lyophilizing the enzyme. Significantly higher molecular weights were obtained in aqueous polymerization systems than when N,N ‐dimethylformamide (DMF) was used as the solvent. Similarly, higher molecular weights were observed for oxidation/reduction than for azo‐type free radical initiators. We have demonstrated that copolymers of sucrose acrylate and acrylic acid are readily prepared. Finally, by optimization of the polymerization system, we have increased the number‐average molecular weight of the poly(sucrose acrylate) from M̄ n = 54 000 to molecular weights M̄ n as high as 2 400 000.",

    "title": "Cofactor Regeneration by a Soluble Pyridine Nucleotide Transhydrogenase for Biological Production of Hydromorphone",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT We have applied the soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase of Pseudomonas fluorescens to a cell-free system for the regeneration of the nicotinamide cofactors NAD and NADP in the biological production of the important semisynthetic opiate drug hydromorphone. The original recombinant whole-cell system suffered from cofactor depletion resulting from the action of an NADP + -dependent morphine dehydrogenase and an NADH-dependent morphinone reductase. By applying a soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, which can transfer reducing equivalents between NAD and NADP, we demonstrate with a cell-free system that efficient cofactor cycling in the presence of catalytic amounts of cofactors occurs, resulting in high yields of hydromorphone. The ratio of morphine dehydrogenase, morphinone reductase, and soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase is critical for diminishing the production of the unwanted by-product dihydromorphine and for optimum hydromorphone yields. Application of the soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase to the whole-cell system resulted in an improved biocatalyst with an extended lifetime. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the soluble pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase and its wider application as a tool in metabolic engineering and biocatalysis.",

    "title": "Diversifying Carotenoid Biosynthetic Pathways by Directed Evolution",
    "abstract": "SUMMARY Microorganisms and plants synthesize a diverse array of natural products, many of which have proven indispensable to human health and well-being. Although many thousands of these have been characterized, the space of possible natural products—those that could be made biosynthetically—remains largely unexplored. For decades, this space has largely been the domain of chemists, who have synthesized scores of natural product analogs and have found many with improved or novel functions. New natural products have also been made in recombinant organisms, via engineered biosynthetic pathways. Recently, methods inspired by natural evolution have begun to be applied to the search for new natural products. These methods force pathways to evolve in convenient laboratory organisms, where the products of new pathways can be identified and characterized in high-throughput screening programs. Carotenoid biosynthetic pathways have served as a convenient experimental system with which to demonstrate these ideas. Researchers have mixed, matched, and mutated carotenoid biosynthetic enzymes and screened libraries of these “evolved” pathways for the emergence of new carotenoid products. This has led to dozens of new pathway products not previously known to be made by the assembled enzymes. These new products include whole families of carotenoids built from backbones not found in nature. This review details the strategies and specific methods that have been employed to generate new carotenoid biosynthetic pathways in the laboratory. The potential application of laboratory evolution to other biosynthetic pathways is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Flavin‐dependent tryptophan halogenases provide a regioselective access to chlorinated and brominated indole derivatives under mild conditions. Application of the halogenase requires a regeneration system for the reduced flavin cofactor FADH 2 , which is usually achieved by enzymatic or chemical reactions. We employed the halogenase PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus as a model system to establish a photochemical approach by using blue light and a reductant for regeneration of FADH 2 . In contrast to previous light‐driven biocatalysis using flavin, the conversion of enzyme‐bound flavin in our approach suppresses futile cycles, in which the free flavin reacts with oxygen under generation of H 2 O 2 . Within 25 h, 70 % of 0.5 m m tryptophan was converted regioselectively to 5‐chlorotryptophan. Our regeneration system paves the way for production of chlorinated compounds by applying only light, halide salt, air, and a cheap sacrificial electron donor in aqueous solution.",

As an alternative to chemical Friedel‐Crafts acylation, the C‐acyltransferase from Pseudomonas protegens has been found to catalyze C−C bond formation with non‐natural resorcinol substrates. Extending the scope of acyl donors, it is now shown that the enzyme is also able to catalyze C−S bond cleavage prior to C−C bond formation, thus aliphatic and aromatic thioesters can be used as acyl donors. It is worth to mention that this reaction can be performed in aqueous buffer. Identifying ethyl thioacetate as the most suitable acetyl donor, the products were obtained with up to >99 % conversion and up to 88 % isolated yield without using additional base additives; this represents a significant advancement to prior protocols.",

    "title": "Directed evolution can rapidly improve the activity of chimeric assembly-line enzymes",
    "abstract": "Nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) are produced by NRP synthetase (NRPS) enzymes that function as molecular assembly lines. The modular architecture of NRPSs suggests that a domain responsible for activating a building block could be replaced with a domain from a foreign NRPS to create a chimeric assembly line that produces a new variant of a natural NRP. However, such chimeric NRPS modules are often heavily impaired, impeding efforts to create novel NRP variants by swapping domains from different modules or organisms. Here we show that impaired chimeric NRPSs can be functionally restored by directed evolution. Using rounds of mutagenesis coupled with in vivo screens for NRP production, we rapidly isolated variants of two different chimeric NRPSs with ≈10-fold improvements in enzyme activity and product yield, including one that produces new derivatives of the potent NRP/polyketide antibiotic andrimid. Because functional restoration in these examples required only modest library sizes (10 3 to 10 4 clones) and three or fewer rounds of screening, our approach may be widely applicable even for NRPSs from genetically challenging hosts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering seek to re-engineer microbes into “living foundries” for the production of high value chemicals. Through a “design-build-test” cycle paradigm, massive libraries of genetically engineered microbes can be constructed and tested for metabolite overproduction and secretion. However, library generation capacity outpaces the rate of high-throughput testing and screening. Well plate assays are flexible but with limited throughput, whereas droplet microfluidic techniques are ultrahigh-throughput but require a custom assay for each target. Here we present RNA-aptamers-in-droplets (RAPID), a method that greatly expands the generality of ultrahigh-throughput microfluidic screening. Using aptamers, we transduce extracellular product titer into fluorescence, allowing ultrahigh-throughput screening of millions of variants. We demonstrate the RAPID approach by enhancing production of tyrosine and secretion of a recombinant protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by up to 28- and 3-fold, respectively. Aptamers-in-droplets affords a general approach for evolving microbes to synthesize and secrete value-added chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Significance Directed enzyme evolution is a powerful approach for discovering new catalysts with applications in green chemistry and elsewhere. However, “hits” in sequence space are rare: If too few members of a library are examined, the chances of success of a campaign are limited. Ultrahigh-throughput screening in emulsion droplets has dramatically increased the odds but requires a fluorescent reaction product that triggers selection of hits. We now introduce an absorbance-based microfluidic droplet sorter that broadens the scope of assays to those producing UV/Vis-active chromophores and demonstrate its usefulness by evolving a dehydrogenase based on the screening of half a million library members. Making ultrahigh-throughput screening possible for previously inaccessible reactions enables much wider use of microfluidic droplet sorters for laboratory evolution.",

    "title": "The challenge of predicting distal active site mutations in computational enzyme design",
    "abstract": "Abstract Many computational enzyme design approaches have been developed in recent years that focus on a reduced set of key enzymatic features. Initial protocols mostly focused on the chemical steps(s) through transition state stabilization, whereas most recent approaches exploit the enzyme conformational dynamics often crucial for substrate binding, product release, and allosteric regulation. The detailed evaluation of the conformational landscape of many laboratory‐evolved enzymes has revealed dramatic changes on the relative stabilities of the conformational states after mutation, favoring those conformational states key for the novel functionality. Of note is that these mutations are often located all around the enzyme structure, which contrasts with most of the computational design strategies that reduce the problem into active site alterations. Recent computational strategies have been developed that consider enzyme design as a population shift problem, that is, redistribution of the relative stabilities of the conformational states induced by mutations. These strategies focus on reconstructing the conformational landscape of the enzyme, applying correlation‐based tools to elucidate the underlying allosteric network of interactions and identify potential mutation hotspots located at the active site, but most importantly at distal positions for the first time.

    "abstract": "Abstract Regioselective methods to establish carbon–halide bonds are still rare, although halogenation is considered as a commonly used methodology for the functionalization of organic compounds. The incorporation of halogen substituents by organic synthesis usually requires hazardous conditions, shows poor regioselectivity and results in the formation of unwanted byproducts. In addition, halogenation by electrophilic aromatic substitution (S E Ar) obeys distinct rules depending on electron‐withdrawing or ‐donating groups already present in the aromatic ring. We employed the tryptophan‐7‐halogenase RebH for regioselective enzymatic halogenation to overcome these limitations. In combination with a tryptophan synthase, an array of C5‐ and C6‐substituted tryptophan derivatives was synthesized and halogenated by RebH. The halogenase is able override these directing effects and halogenates at the electronically unfavored C7‐ meta ‐position, even in presence of ortho / para ‐directing groups.",

This flow process enables practical use of an unstable allenyllithium intermediate. The process uses the commercially available and recyclable (1 S ,2 R )‐ N ‐pyrrolidinyl norephedrine as a ligand to promote the highly diastereoselective (32:1) propargylation. Judicious selection of mixers based on the chemistry requirement and real‐time monitoring of the process using process analytical technology (PAT) enabled stable and scalable flow chemistry runs.",

    "title": "Maximization of cell viability rather than biocatalyst activity improves whole‐cell ω‐oxyfunctionalization performance",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is a common misconception in whole‐cell biocatalysis to refer to an enzyme as the biocatalyst, thereby neglecting the structural and metabolic framework provided by the cell. Here, the low whole‐cell biocatalyst stability, that is, the stability of specific biocatalyst activity, in a process for the terminal oxyfunctionalization of renewable fatty acid methyl esters was investigated. This reaction, which is difficult to achieve by chemical means, is catalyzed by Escherichia coli featuring the monooxygenase system AlkBGT and the uptake facilitator AlkL from Pseudomonas putida GPo1. Corresponding products, that is, terminal alcohols, aldehydes, and acids, constitute versatile bifunctional building blocks, which are of special interest for polymer synthesis. It could clearly be shown that extensive dodecanoic acid methyl ester uptake mediated by high AlkL levels leads to whole‐cell biocatalyst toxification. Thus, cell viability constitutes the primary factor limiting biocatalyst stability and, as a result, process durability. Hence, a compromise had to be found between low biocatalyst activity due to restricted substrate uptake and poor biocatalyst stability due to AlkL‐mediated toxification. This was achieved by the fine‐tuning of heterologous alkL expression, which, furthermore, enabled the identification of the alkBGT expression level as another critical factor determining biocatalyst stability. Controlled synthesis of AlkL and reduced alkBGT expression finally enabled an increase of product titers by a factor of 4.3 up to 229 g L org −1 in a two‐liquid phase bioprocess setup. Clearly, ω‐oxyfunctionalization process performance was determined by cell viability and thus biocatalyst stability rather than the maximally achievable specific biocatalyst activity. Biotechnol.

    "title": "A cell-free platform for the prenylation of natural products and application to cannabinoid production",
    "abstract": "Abstract Prenylation of natural compounds adds structural diversity, alters biological activity, and enhances therapeutic potential. Because prenylated compounds often have a low natural abundance, alternative production methods are needed. Metabolic engineering enables natural product biosynthesis from inexpensive biomass, but is limited by the complexity of secondary metabolite pathways, intermediate and product toxicities, and substrate accessibility. Alternatively, enzyme catalyzed prenyl transfer provides excellent regio- and stereo-specificity, but requires expensive isoprenyl pyrophosphate substrates. Here we develop a flexible cell-free enzymatic prenylating system that generates isoprenyl pyrophosphate substrates from glucose to prenylate an array of natural products. The system provides an efficient route to cannabinoid precursors cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and cannabigerovarinic acid (CBGVA) at >1 g/L, and a single enzymatic step converts the precursors into cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabidivarinic acid (CBDVA). Cell-free methods may provide a powerful alternative to metabolic engineering for chemicals that are hard to produce in living organisms.",

Deoxy‐, epi ‐, and podophyllotoxin, which are all precursors to frequently used chemotherapeutic agents, were prepared by a stereodivergent biotransformation and a biocatalytic kinetic resolution of the corresponding dibenzylbutyrolactones with the same 2‐oxoglutarate‐dependent dioxygenase. The reaction can be conducted on 2 g scale, and the enzyme allows tailoring of the initial, “natural” structure and thus transforms various non‐natural derivatives.

    "title": "Directed Evolution Strategies for Enantiocomplementary Haloalkane Dehalogenases: From Chemical Waste to Enantiopure Building Blocks",
    "abstract": "Abstract We used directed evolution to obtain enantiocomplementary haloalkane dehalogenase variants that convert the toxic waste compound 1,2,3‐trichloropropane (TCP) into highly enantioenriched ( R )‐ or ( S )‐2,3‐dichloropropan‐1‐ol, which can easily be converted into optically active epichlorohydrins—attractive intermediates for the synthesis of enantiopure fine chemicals. A dehalogenase with improved catalytic activity but very low enantioselectivity was used as the starting point. A strategy that made optimal use of the limited capacity of the screening assay, which was based on chiral gas chromatography, was developed. We used pair‐wise site‐saturation mutagenesis (SSM) of all 16 noncatalytic active‐site residues during the initial two rounds of evolution. The resulting best R ‐ and S ‐enantioselective variants were further improved in two rounds of site‐restricted mutagenesis (SRM), with incorporation of carefully selected sets of amino acids at a larger number of positions, including sites that are more distant from the active site. Finally, the most promising mutations and positions were promoted to a combinatorial library by using a multi‐site mutagenesis protocol with restricted codon sets. To guide the design of partly undefined (ambiguous) codon sets for these restricted libraries we employed structural information, the results of multiple sequence alignments, and knowledge from earlier rounds. After five rounds of evolution with screening of only 5500 clones, we obtained two strongly diverged haloalkane dehalogenase variants that give access to ( R )‐epichlorohydrin with 90 % ee and to ( S )‐epichlorohydrin with 97 % ee , containing 13 and 17 mutations, respectively, around their active sites.",

A biphasic reaction system allowed high substrate loadings, whereas the microreactor ensured excellent mass transfer rates between the organic and aqueous phases. Oxygen was supplied continuously by membrane aeration across the whole reaction compartment. The productivities achieved in the tube‐in‐tube microreactor were 38 times higher than those in previously described batch reactors and almost 4 times higher than for the same reaction in a microreactor in which aqueous, organic, and air phases were delivered through consecutive segments.

    "abstract": "Abstract The introduction of β-hydroxy-α-amino acids (βHAAs) into organic molecules has received considerable attention as these molecules have often found widespread applications in bioorganic chemistry, medicinal chemistry and biomaterial science. Despite innovation of asymmetric synthesis of βHAAs, stereoselective synthesis to control the two chiral centres at C α and C β positions is still challenging, with poor atomic economy and multi protection and deprotection steps. These syntheses are often operated under harsh conditions. Therefore, a biotransformation approach using biocatalysts is needed to selectively introduce these two chiral centres into structurally diverse molecules. Yet, there are few ways that enable one-step synthesis of βHAAs. One is to extend the substrate scope of the existing enzyme inventory. Threonine aldolases have been explored to produce βHAAs. However, the enzymes have poor controlled installation at C β position, often resulting in a mixture of diastereoisomers which are difficult to be separated. In this respect, l -threonine transaldolases (LTTAs) offer an excellent potential as the enzymes often provide controlled stereochemistry at C α and C β positions. Another is to mine LTTA homologues and engineer the enzymes using directed evolution with the aim of finding engineered biocatalysts to accept broad substrates with enhanced conversion and stereoselectivity. Here, we review the development of LTTAs that incorporate various aldehyde acceptors to generate structurally diverse βHAAs and highlight areas for future developments. Key points • The general mechanism of the transaldolation reaction catalysed by LTTAs • Recent advances in LTTAs from different biosynthetic pathways • Applications of LTTAs as biocatalysts for production of βHAAs",

    "title": "The Industrial Age of Biocatalytic Transamination",
    "abstract": "Abstract During the last decade the use of ω‐transaminases has been identified as a very powerful method for the preparation of optically pure amines from the corresponding ketones. Their immense potential for the preparation of chiral amines, together with their ease of use in combination with existing biocatalytic methods, have made these biocatalysts a competitor to any chemical methodology for (asymmetric) amination. An increasing number of examples, especially from industry, shows that this biocatalytic technology outmaneuvers existing chemical processes by its simple and flexible nature. In the last few years numerous publications and patents on synthetic routes, mainly to pharmaceuticals, involving ω‐transaminases have been published. The review gives an overview of the application of ω‐transaminases in organic synthesis with a focus on active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and the developments during the last few years.",

    "title": "An Enzyme Cascade Synthesis of ε‐Caprolactone and its Oligomers",
    "abstract": "Abstract Poly‐ε‐caprolactone (PCL) is chemically produced on an industrial scale in spite of the need for hazardous peracetic acid as an oxidation reagent. Although Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenases (BVMO) in principle enable the enzymatic synthesis of ε‐caprolactone (ε‐CL) directly from cyclohexanone with molecular oxygen, current systems suffer from low productivity and are subject to substrate and product inhibition. The major limitations for such a biocatalytic route to produce this bulk chemical were overcome by combining an alcohol dehydrogenase with a BVMO to enable the efficient oxidation of cyclohexanol to ε‐CL. Key to success was a subsequent direct ring‐opening oligomerization of in situ formed ε‐CL in the aqueous phase by using lipase A from Candida antarctica, thus efficiently solving the product inhibition problem and leading to the formation of oligo‐ε‐CL at more than 20 g L −1 when starting from 200 m M cyclohexanol. This oligomer is easily chemically polymerized to PCL.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A bi‐enzymatic cascade consisting of a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase and an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was designed in a convergent fashion to utilise two molar equivalents of cyclohexanone (CHO) and one equivalent of 1,6‐hexanediol as a ‘double‐smart cosubstrate’ to produce ε‐caprolactone (ECL) with water as sole by‐product. The convergent enzymatic cascade reaction reported herein, is performed at ambient conditions in water, is self‐sufficient with respect to cofactor, and incorporates all starting materials into the desired product, ECL. Among different enzymes explored, the reaction catalysed by cyclohexanone monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. NCIMB 9871 coupled with ADH from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus showed the best results, reaching 91 % conversion of CHO after 24 h with a product titre of 2 g L −1 . Scale‐up of the coupled system (50 mL) performed better than the small‐scale reactions and >99 % conversion of CHO and ECL concentration of 20 m M were achieved within 18 h.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herein, the catalytic promiscuity of TcCGT1, a new C ‐glycosyltransferase (CGT) from the medicinal plant Trollius chinensis is explored. TcCGT1 could efficiently and regio‐specifically catalyze the 8‐ C ‐glycosylation of 36 flavones and other flavonoids and could also catalyze the O ‐glycosylation of diverse phenolics. The crystal structure of TcCGT1 in complex with uridine diphosphate was determined at 1.85 Å resolution. Molecular docking revealed a new model for the catalytic mechanism of TcCGT1, which is initiated by the spontaneous deprotonation of the substrate. The spacious binding pocket explains the substrate promiscuity, and the binding pose of the substrate determines C ‐ or O ‐glycosylation activity. Site‐directed mutagenesis at two residues (I94E and G284K) switched C ‐ to O ‐glycosylation. TcCGT1 is the first plant CGT with a crystal structure and the first flavone 8‐ C ‐glycosyltransferase described. This provides a basis for designing efficient glycosylation biocatalysts.",

Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract De novo enzyme design has sought to introduce active sites and substrate-binding pockets that are predicted to catalyse a reaction of interest into geometrically compatible native scaffolds 1,2 , but has been limited by a lack of suitable protein structures and the complexity of native protein sequence–structure relationships. Here we describe a deep-learning-based ‘family-wide hallucination’ approach that generates large numbers of idealized protein structures containing diverse pocket shapes and designed sequences that encode them. We use these scaffolds to design artificial luciferases that selectively catalyse the oxidative chemiluminescence of the synthetic luciferin substrates diphenylterazine 3 and 2-deoxycoelenterazine. The designed active sites position an arginine guanidinium group adjacent to an anion that develops during the reaction in a binding pocket with high shape complementarity. For both luciferin substrates, we obtain designed luciferases with high selectivity; the most active of these is a small (13.9 kDa) and thermostable (with a melting temperature higher than 95 °C) enzyme that has a catalytic efficiency on diphenylterazine ( k cat / K m = 10 6 M −1 s −1 ) comparable to that of native luciferases, but a much higher substrate specificity. The creation of highly active and specific biocatalysts from scratch with broad applications in biomedicine is a key milestone for computational enzyme design, and our approach should enable generation of a wide range of luciferases and other enzymes.",

    "title": "Addressing the Numbers Problem in Directed Evolution",
    "abstract": "Abstract Our previous contribution to increasing the efficiency of directed evolution is iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) as a systematic means of generating focused libraries for the control of substrate acceptance, enantioselectivity, or thermostability of enzymes. We have now introduced a crucial element to knowledge‐guided targeted mutagenesis in general that helps to solve the numbers problem in directed evolution. We show that the choice of the amino acid (aa) alphabet, as specified by the utilized codon degeneracy, provides the experimenter with a powerful tool in designing “smarter” randomized libraries that require considerably less screening effort. A systematic comparison of two different codon degeneracies was made by examining the relative quality of the identically sized enzyme libraries in relation to the degree of oversampling required in the screening process. The specific example in our case study concerns the conventional NNK codon degeneracy (32 codons/20 aa) versus NDT (12 codons/12 aa). The model reaction is the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of a chiral trans ‐disubstituted epoxide, catalyzed by the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger . The NDT library proves to be of much higher quality, as measured by the dramatically higher frequency of positive variants and by the magnitude of catalyst improvement (enhanced rate and enantioselectivity). We provide a statistical analysis that constitutes a useful guide for the optimal design and generation of “smarter” focused libraries. This type of approach accelerates the process of laboratory evolution considerably and can be expected to be broadly applicable when engineering functional proteins in general.",

Through the synergistic merger of photoredox catalysis and pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) biocatalysis, we developed a pyridoxal radical biocatalysis approach to prepare valuable noncanonical amino acids, including those bearing a stereochemical dyad or triad, without the need for protecting groups. Using engineered PLP enzymes, either enantiomeric product could be produced in a biocatalyst-controlled fashion. Synergistic photoredox - pyridoxal radical biocatalysis represents a powerful platform with which to discover previously unknown catalytic reactions and to tame radical intermediates for asymmetric catalysis.",

    "title": "Machine Learning-Assisted Directed Evolution Navigates a Combinatorial Epistatic Fitness Landscape with Minimal Screening Burden",
    "abstract": "Abstract Due to screening limitations, in directed evolution (DE) of proteins it is rarely feasible to fully evaluate combinatorial mutant libraries made by mutagenesis at multiple sites. Instead, DE often involves a single-step greedy optimization in which the mutation in the highest-fitness variant identified in each round of single-site mutagenesis is fixed. However, because the effects of a mutation can depend on the presence or absence of other mutations, the efficiency and effectiveness of a single-step greedy walk is influenced by both the starting variant and the order in which beneficial mutations are identified—the process is path-dependent. We recently demonstrated a path-independent machine learning-assisted approach to directed evolution (MLDE) that allows in silico screening of full combinatorial libraries made by simultaneous saturation mutagenesis, thus explicitly capturing the effects of cooperative mutations and bypassing the path-dependence that can limit greedy optimization. Here, we thoroughly investigate and optimize an MLDE workflow by testing a number of design considerations of the MLDE pipeline. Specifically, we (1) test the effects of different encoding strategies on MLDE efficiency, (2) integrate new models and a training procedure more amenable to protein engineering tasks, and (3) incorporate training set design strategies to avoid information-poor low-fitness protein variants (“holes”) in the training data. When applied to an epistatic, hole-filled, four-site combinatorial fitness landscape of protein G domain B1 (GB1), the resulting focused training MLDE (ftMLDE) protocol achieved the global fitness maximum up to 92% of the time at a total screening burden of 470 variants. In contrast, minimal-screening-burden single-step greedy optimization over the GB1 fitness landscape reached the global maximum just 1.2% of the time; ftMLDE matching this minimal screening burden (80 total variants) achieved the global optimum up to 9.6% of the time with a 49% higher expected maximum fitness achieved. To facilitate further development of MLDE, we present the MLDE software package ( https://github.com/fhalab/MLDE ), which is designed for use by protein engineers without computational or machine learning expertise.",

Reported here is a short chemoenzymatic total synthesis of (−)‐podophyllotoxin and related aryltetralin lignans. Vital to this approach is the use of an enzymatic oxidative C−C coupling reaction to construct the tetracyclic core of the natural product in a diastereoselective fashion. This strategy allows gram‐scale access to (−)‐deoxypodophyllotoxin and is readily adaptable to the preparation of related aryltetralin lignans.",

    "title": "A Non-Canonical Nucleophile Unlocks a New Mechanistic Pathway in a Designed Enzyme",
    "abstract": "Abstract Directed evolution of computationally designed enzymes has provided new insights into the emergence of sophisticated catalytic sites in proteins. In this regard, we have recently shown that a histidine nucleophile and a flexible arginine can work in synergy to accelerate the Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction with unrivalled efficiency. Here, we show that replacing the catalytic histidine with a non-canonical N δ -methylhistidine (MeHis23) nucleophile leads to a substantially altered evolutionary outcome in which the catalytic Arg124 has been abandoned. Instead, a Glu26 has emerged, which mediates a rate-limiting proton transfer step to deliver an enzyme (BH MeHis 1.8) that is an order of magnitude more active than our earlier MBHase. Interestingly, the MeHis nucleophile of BH MeHis 1.8 can be replaced by a canonical histidine with only a modest, 4-fold reduction in k cat . However, analysis of the BH MeHis 1.8 evolutionary trajectory reveals that the non-canonical nucleophile was crucial in the early stages of engineering to unlock the new mechanistic pathway. This study demonstrates how even subtle perturbations to key catalytic elements of designed enzymes can lead to vastly different evolutionary outcomes, resulting in new mechanistic solutions to complex chemical transformations.",

Nature offers an extensive portfolio of enzymes catalysing reversible decarboxylation of hydroxyaromatic acids, whose equilibrium can be pushed towards the side of the carboxylated products. Extensive structural and mutagenesis studies have allowed recent advances in the understanding of the reaction mechanism of decarboxylase enzymes, ultimately enabling an improved yield and expansion of the scope of the reaction.

    "title": "Neutral genetic drift can alter promiscuous protein functions, potentially aiding functional evolution",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Many of the mutations accumulated by naturally evolving proteins are neutral in the sense that they do not significantly alter a protein's ability to perform its primary biological function. However, new protein functions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions that are incidental to a protein's original biological role. If mutations that are neutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause substantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable future functional evolution. Results Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how cytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on a single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on five other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much as four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous activities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely rationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The activities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated fashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change in one activity based on the measurement of several others. Conclusion Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead to substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under selection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional evolution should selection favor new functions in the future.

    "abstract": "Abstract Motivation Protein tunnels and channels are key transport pathways that allow ligands to pass between proteins’ external and internal environments. These functionally important structural features warrant detailed attention. It is difficult to study the ligand binding and unbinding processes experimentally, while molecular dynamics simulations can be time-consuming and computationally demanding. Results CaverDock is a new software tool for analysing the ligand passage through the biomolecules. The method uses the optimized docking algorithm of AutoDock Vina for ligand placement docking and implements a parallel heuristic algorithm to search the space of possible trajectories. The duration of the simulations takes from minutes to a few hours. Here we describe the implementation of the method and demonstrate CaverDock’s usability by: (i) comparison of the results with other available tools, (ii) determination of the robustness with large ensembles of ligands and (iii) the analysis and comparison of the ligand trajectories in engineered tunnels. Thorough testing confirms that CaverDock is applicable for the fast analysis of ligand binding and unbinding in fundamental enzymology and protein engineering.

    "abstract": "Abstract 2‐Phenylethanol is a widely used aroma compound with rose‐like fragrance and L ‐homophenylalanine is a building block of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. 2‐phenylethanol and L ‐homophenylalanine were synthesized simultaneously with high yield from 2‐oxo‐4‐phenylbutyric acid and L ‐phenylalanine, respectively. A recombinant Escherichia coli harboring a coupled reaction pathway comprising of aromatic transaminase, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, carbonyl reductase, and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was constructed. In the coupled reaction pathway, the transaminase reaction was coupled with the Ehrlich pathway of yeast; (1) a phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (YDR380W) as the enzyme to generate the substrate for the carbonyl reductase from phenylpyruvate (i.e., byproduct of the transaminase reaction) and to shift the reaction equilibrium of the transaminase reaction, and (2) a carbonyl reductase (YGL157W) to produce the 2‐phenylethanol. Selecting the right carbonyl reductase showing the highest activity on phenylacetaldehyde with narrow substrate specificity was the key to success of the constructing the coupling reaction. In addition, NADPH regeneration was achieved by incorporating the GDH from Bacillus subtilis in the coupled reaction pathway. Based on 40 mM of L ‐phenylalanine used, about 96% final product conversion yield of 2‐phenylethanol was achieved using the recombinant E . coli . Biotechnol.

The net production of 1,2-epoxyoctane by resting cells never exceeded 0.6 mg/ml of suspension. In contrast, P. oleovorans produced much more epoxide when it was grown on high levels of 1-octene. To raise the total production of epoxide, the octene layer was repeatedly transferred to fresh, growing cultures of P. oleovorans.

    "title": "Biocatalysis with Unnatural Amino Acids: Enzymology Meets Xenobiology",
    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of xenobiology is to design biological systems endowed with unusual biochemical functions, whereas enzymology concerns the study of enzymes, the workhorses of biocatalysis. Biocatalysis employs enzymes and organisms to perform useful biotransformations in synthetic chemistry and biotechnology. During the past few years, the effects of incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into enzymes with potential applications in biocatalysis have been increasingly investigated. In this Review, we provide an overview of the effects of new chemical functionalities that have been introduced into proteins to improve various facets of enzymatic catalysis. We also discuss future research avenues that will complement unnatural mutagenesis with standard protein engineering to produce novel and versatile biocatalysts with applications in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology.",

    "title": "Enzyme thermoinactivation in anhydrous organic solvents",
    "abstract": "Abstract Three unrelated enzymes (ribonuclease, chymotrypsin, and lysozyme) display markedly enhanced thermostability in anhydrous organic solvents compared to that in aqueous solution. At 110‐145°C in nonaqueous media all three enzymes inactivate due to heat‐induced protein aggregation, as determined by gel filtration chromatography. Using bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A as a model, it has been established that enzymes are much more thermostable in hydrophobic solvents (shown to be essentially inert with respect to their interaction with the protein) than in hydrophilic ones (shown to strip water from the enzyme). The heat‐induced aggregates of ribonuclease were characterized as both physically associated and chemically crosslinked protein agglomerates, with the latter being in part due to transamidation and intermolecular disulfide interchange reactions. The thermal denaturation of ribonuclease in neat organic solvents has been examined by means of differential scanning calorimetry. In hydrophobic solvents, the enzyme exhibits greatly enhanced thermal denaturation temperatures ( T m values as high as 124°C) compared to aqueous solution. The thermostability of ribonuclease towards heat‐induced denaturation and aggregation decreases as the water content of the protein powder increases. The experimental data obtained suggest that enzymes are extremely thermostable in anhydrous organic solvents due to their conformational rigidity in the dehydrated state and their resistance to nearly all the covalent reactions causing irreversible thermoinactivation of enzymes in aqueous solution.",

They possess properties making them suitable for practical use. First, the preparations are hundreds of times more stable against irreversible thermoinactivation than native enzymes. Second, on immobilization, the reversible conformational changes which also lower enzyme activity at elevated temperatures are completely suppressed. As a result, the temperatures of maximum activity for trypsin and α‐chymotrypsin covalently entrapped in polyacrylamide gel are 75 and 70°C, respectively—25 and 30°C higher than the corresponding values for the native enzymes. Therefore, the copolymerized enzyme preparations have a high operational stability at elevated temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The asymmetric synthetic potential of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase catalyzed oxidations of variously 3-substituted pentane-1,5-diols has been further delineated. The oxidations proceed with enantiotopic selectivity to give the corresponding (3S)-3-substituted valerolactones of up to 78% ee. The reactions occur via initial oxidation of the pro-S hydroxyethyl group, with the initially-formed hydroxyaldehydes undergoing further in situ enzyme-catalyzed oxidation in their hemiacetal forms to give the (3S)-lactones directly. The hemiacetal oxidation step is also stereoselective, with oxidation of the (4S)-enantiomer being much preferred. The size of the substituent at C-3 in the diols (C-4 in the hemiacetals) affects both the enantiotopic and enantiomeric specificity of the enzyme. Both types of stereospecificity are highest when the substituents are smallest, such as methyl or ethyl, and diminish progressively for diol or hemiacetal substrates bearing large aliphatic or aromatic substituents. All reactions were carried out on a preparative (up to 2 g) scale.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) has long been considered an engineering marvel, transforming landscapes and shaping biological diversity through its dam building behavior. While the beaver possesses conspicuous morphological features uniquely adapted for the use of woody plants as construction materials and dietary staples, relatively little is known about the specialized microorganisms inhabiting the beaver gastrointestinal tract and their functional roles in determining host nutrition. Here we use a combination of shotgun metagenomics, functional screening and carbohydrate biochemistry to chart the community structure and metabolic power of the beaver fecal microbiome. We relate this information to the metabolic capacity of other wood feeding and hindgut fermenting organisms and profile the functional repertoire of glycoside hydrolase (GH) families distributed among and between population genome bins. Metagenomic screening revealed novel mechanisms of xylan oligomer degradation involving GH43 enzymes from uncharacterized subfamilies and divergent polysaccharide utilization loci, indicating the potential for synergistic biomass deconstruction. Together, these results open a functional metagenomic window on less conspicuous adaptations enabling the beaver microbiome to efficiently convert woody plants into host nutrition and point toward rational design of enhanced enzyme mixtures for biorefining process streams.",

    "abstract": "The explosive growth in our knowledge of genomes, proteomes, and metabolomes is driving ever-increasing fundamental understanding of the biochemistry of life, enabling qualitatively new studies of complex biological systems and their evolution. This knowledge also drives modern biotechnologies, such as molecular engineering and synthetic biology, which have enormous potential to address urgent problems, including developing potent new drugs and providing environmentally friendly energy. Many of these studies, however, are ultimately limited by their need for even-higher-throughput measurements of biochemical reactions. We present a general ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using drop-based microfluidics that overcomes these limitations and revolutionizes both the scale and speed of screening. We use aqueous drops dispersed in oil as picoliter-volume reaction vessels and screen them at rates of thousands per second. To demonstrate its power, we apply the system to directed evolution, identifying new mutants of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase exhibiting catalytic rates more than 10 times faster than their parent, which is already a very efficient enzyme. We exploit the ultrahigh throughput to use an initial purifying selection that removes inactive mutants; we identify ∼100 variants comparable in activity to the parent from an initial population of ∼10 7 . After a second generation of mutagenesis and high-stringency screening, we identify several significantly improved mutants, some approaching diffusion-limited efficiency. In total, we screen ∼10 8 individual enzyme reactions in only 10 h, using < 150 μL of total reagent volume; compared to state-of-the-art robotic screening systems, we perform the entire assay with a 1,000-fold increase in speed and a 1-million-fold reduction in cost.",

    "abstract": "The question of how to distinguish between lipases and esterases is about as old as the definition of the subclassification is. Many different criteria have been proposed to this end, all indicative but not decisive. Here, the activity of lipases in dry organic solvents as a criterion is probed on a minimal α/β hydrolase fold enzyme, the Bacillus subtilis lipase A (BSLA), and compared to Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), a proven lipase. Both hydrolases show activity in dry solvents and this proves BSLA to be a lipase. Overall, this demonstrates the value of this additional parameter to distinguish between lipases and esterases. Lipases tend to be active in dry organic solvents, while esterases are not active under these circumstances.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Deep eutectic solvents (DES) have emerged as promising solutions in many areas of chemistry. DES have many of the advantages of ionic liquids (e.g., low vapor pressure, nonflammability, tunability, etc.) but have lower costs, straightforward syntheses, and are often biodegradable. In this minireview, we discuss briefly the applications of DES in areas such as biotransformations, organocatalysis, and combinations of these that lead to multistep processes. DES can be used as solvents, cosolvents, performance additives for bio‐ and organocatalysis, tools to anchor organocatalysts selectively, or for extraction/separation. Several DES have been used both as solvents and organocatalysts at the same time. Given their promising features, it may be expected that many applications in these areas will appear in the coming years.",

Here we report a detailed characterization of ten selected enzyme variants by kinetic and spectroscopic methods to further elucidate the impact of circular permutation on the structure and function of CALB. Our experiments identify lipase variants with up to 175‐fold enhanced k cat / K M values over wild‐type. In addition, circular permutation does not change the enzymes’ enantiopreference and preserves or even improves their enantioselectivity compared to that of the wild‐type enzyme. Finally, our spectroscopic analyses suggest that the structural effects of circular permutation on CALB are mostly local, concentrating on regions near the native and new protein termini. The observed changes in secondary structure and protein thermostability vary among enzyme variants but directly correlate with the locations of the new termini, a first step towards a predictive framework.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The influence of the thermodynamic activity of water ( a w )on the synthesis of triolein catalyzed by Mucor miehei lipase was investigated. Its effect on the equilibrium and on the rates of the different reactions present, esteification and mono‐ and diglyceride isomerization, was evaluated through measurements made in controlled water activity atmosphere. The apparent equilibrium constants were measured from the concentration of the different species as a function of the intial glycerol‐to oleic‐acid ratio using all the values at once with a multi‐response nonlinear regression technique. Rate constants were determined from kinetic measurements and non‐linear regression uning the variation of the concentration of all significant species in the system. Except for the synthesis of diolein from monoolein, which shows a maximum for a w ≈ 0.5, the apparent rate constants of the various reactions are not significantly affected by the value of the water activity. The equilibrium is shifted to‐ward the synthesis of triolein for low values of a w , indicating that in the design of a process for triglyceride synthesis, using M. miehei lipase as a catalyst, the water activity can be lowered to extreme values to favor the synthesis, without any sacrifice on the productivity of the process. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

The chemical modality space has expanded recently from small molecules to address new challenging targets. Besides the classical SAR/SPR optimization of drug molecules also their ‘greenness’ has increasing importance. The entire pharma discovery ecosystem has developed significantly. Beyond pharma and academia new key players such as Biotech and integrated CROs as well as Digital companies have appeared and are now to a large extend fueled by VC money. Digitalization is happening everywhere but surprisingly did not change speed and success rates of projects so far. Future Medicinal Chemists will still have to be excellent synthetic chemists but in addition they must be knowledgeable in new computational areas such as data sciences. Their ability to collaborate and to work in teams is key.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Directed evolution is a broadly successful strategy for protein engineering in the quest to enhance the stereoselectivity, activity, and thermostability of enzymes. To increase the efficiency of directed evolution based on iterative saturation mutagenesis, the adaptive substituent reordering algorithm (ASRA) is introduced here as an alternative to traditional quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods for identifying potential protein mutants with desired properties from minimal sampling of focused libraries. The operation of ASRA depends on identifying the underlying regularity of the protein property landscape, allowing it to make predictions without explicit knowledge of the structure–property relationships. In a proof‐of‐principle study, ASRA identified all or most of the best enantioselective mutants among the synthesized epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger , in the absence of peptide seeds with high E ‐values. ASRA even revealed a laboratory error from irregularities of the reordered E‐ value landscape alone.",

The strategy combinedly exploits (i) the known dramatic enhancement of the protein conformational rigidity in a water-restricted milieu and (ii) the reported conformational changes associated with the activation of these enzymes at lipid-water interfaces, which basically involves an increased substrate accessibility to the active site and/or an induction of a more competent catalytic machinery. Six model enzymes have been assayed in several model reactions in nonaqueous media. The results, rationalized in light of the present biochemical and structural knowledge, show that the IAMI approach represents a straightforward, versatile method to generate manageable, activated (kinetically trapped) forms of lipolytic enzymes, providing under optimal conditions nonaqueous rate enhancements of up to two orders of magnitude. It is also shown that imprintability of lipolytic enzymes depends not only on the nature of the enzyme but also on the \"quality\" of the interface used as the template.",

    "title": "Robust enzyme design: Bioinformatic tools for improved protein stability",
    "abstract": "Abstract The ability of proteins and enzymes to maintain a functionally active conformation under adverse environmental conditions is an important feature of biocatalysts, vaccines, and biopharmaceutical proteins. From an evolutionary perspective, robust stability of proteins improves their biological fitness and allows for further optimization. Viewed from an industrial perspective, enzyme stability is crucial for the practical application of enzymes under the required reaction conditions. In this review, we analyze bioinformatic‐driven strategies that are used to predict structural changes that can be applied to wild type proteins in order to produce more stable variants. The most commonly employed techniques can be classified into stochastic approaches, empirical or systematic rational design strategies, and design of chimeric proteins. We conclude that bioinformatic analysis can be efficiently used to study large protein superfamilies systematically as well as to predict particular structural changes which increase enzyme stability. Evolution has created a diversity of protein properties that are encoded in genomic sequences and structural data. Bioinformatics has the power to uncover this evolutionary code and provide a reproducible selection of hotspots – key residues to be mutated in order to produce more stable and functionally diverse proteins and enzymes. Further development of systematic bioinformatic procedures is needed to organize and analyze sequences and structures of proteins within large superfamilies and to link them to function, as well as to provide knowledge‐based predictions for experimental evaluation.",

Over the last 30 years, the reaction has unanimously been described in literature as irreversible because of the concomitant release of CO 2 if using lithium hydroxypyruvate (LiHPA) as a substrate. Following the reaction over a longer period of time however, we have now found it to be initially kinetically controlled. Contrary to previous suggestions, for the non‐natural conversion of synthetically more interesting apolar substrates, the complete change of active‐site polarity is therefore not necessary. From docking studies it was revealed that water and hydrogen‐bond networks are essential for substrate binding, thus allowing aliphatic aldehydes to be converted in the charged active site of transketolase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nature applies enzymatic assembly lines to synthesize bioactive compounds. Inspired by such capabilities, we have developed a facile method for spatially segregating attached enzymes in a continuous‐flow, vortex fluidic device (VFD). Fused His n ‐tags at the protein termini allow rapid bioconjugation and consequent purification through complexation with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) resin. Six proteins were purified from complex cell lysates to average homogeneities of 76 %. The most challenging to purify, tobacco epi‐aristolochene synthase, was purified in only ten minutes from cell lysate to near homogeneity (>90 %). Furthermore, this “reaction‐ready” system demonstrated excellent stability during five days of continuous‐flow processing. Towards multi‐step transformations in continuous flow, proteins were arrayed as ordered zones on the reactor surface allowing segregation of catalysts. Ordering enzymes into zones opens up new opportunities for continuous‐flow biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This perspective represents a (highly personal) examination of the past, present and future of synthetic organic chemistry. The central thesis posits that the confluence of factors that led to the “Golden Age of Natural Product Synthesis” in the second half of the twentieth century can be traced back to the identification of the therapeutic potential of steroid hormones culminating in the introduction of oral contraceptives. The tremendous benefits of those activities to the development of organic synthesis as a vibrant discipline led to the exponential increase in strategies and methods and the ability to tackle, larger and larger molecules of greater and greater complexity. The existential challenge to the health of organic synthesis is whether a similarly dynamic future can be anticipated and if so, to what end and how. Musings on potential answers to those questions are presented.",

    "title": "Application of Enzyme Coupling Reactions to Shift Thermodynamically Limited Biocatalytic Reactions",
    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, much interest has been shown in the use of multi‐enzyme cascades as a tool in organic synthesis. Such enzymatic cascades can provide added value to a synthetic scheme by starting from cheaper raw materials or making more valuable products. Additionally, they can be used to help shift the equilibrium of otherwise thermodynamically unfavourable reactions to give a higher conversion of the target product. By coupling an energetically unfavourable reaction with a more favourable one, the multi‐enzyme cascade mimics the approach taken in nature in metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, it can be challenging to combine several engineered enzymes in vitro for the conversion of non‐natural substrates. In this mini‐review we focus on enzyme coupling reactions as a tool to alleviate thermodynamic constraints in synthetically useful biocatalytic reactions. The implications of thermodynamic parameters such as the equilibrium constant on the multi‐enzyme cascades and the conventional methods of equilibrium shifting are also discussed in addition to methods used to estimate such values.",

    "title": "Broadly applicable and accurate protein design by integrating structure prediction networks and diffusion generative models",
    "abstract": "Abstract There has been considerable recent progress in designing new proteins using deep learning methods 1–9 . Despite this progress, a general deep learning framework for protein design that enables solution of a wide range of design challenges, including de novo binder design and design of higher order symmetric architectures, has yet to be described. Diffusion models 10,11 have had considerable success in image and language generative modeling but limited success when applied to protein modeling, likely due to the complexity of protein backbone geometry and sequence-structure relationships. Here we show that by fine tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, we obtain a generative model of protein backbones that achieves outstanding performance on unconditional and topology-constrained protein monomer design, protein binder design, symmetric oligomer design, enzyme active site scaffolding, and symmetric motif scaffolding for therapeutic and metal-binding protein design. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method, called RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RF diffusion ), by experimentally characterizing the structures and functions of hundreds of new designs. In a manner analogous to networks which produce images from user-specified inputs, RF diffusion enables the design of diverse, complex, functional proteins from simple molecular specifications.",

    "abstract": "Significance Understanding the relationship between protein sequence and function is necessary to design new and useful proteins with applications in bioenergy, medicine, and agriculture. The mapping from sequence to function is tremendously complex because it involves thousands of molecular interactions that are coupled over multiple lengths and timescales. We show that neural networks can learn the sequence–function mapping from large protein datasets. Neural networks are appealing for this task because they can learn complicated relationships from data, make few assumptions about the nature of the sequence–function relationship, and can learn general rules that apply across the length of the protein sequence. We demonstrate that learned models can be applied to design new proteins with properties that exceed natural sequences.",

    "abstract": "Ursodeoxycholic acid dissolves cholesterol gallstones in humans. In the present study optimum conditions for ursodeoxycholic acid production by Fusarium equiseti M41 were studied. Resting mycelia of F. equiseti M41 showed maximum conversion at 28 degrees C, pH 8.0, and dissolved oxygen tension of higher than 60% saturation. Monovalent cations, such as Na+, K+, and Rb+, stimulated the conversion rate more than twofold. In the presence of 0.5 M KCl, the initial uptake rate and equilibrium concentration of lithocholic acid (substrate) were enhanced by 5.7- and 1.7-fold, respectively. We confirmed that enzyme activity catalyzing 7 beta-hydroxylation of lithocholic acid was induced by substrate lithocholic acid. The activity in the mycelium was controlled by dissolved oxygen tension during cultivation: with a dissolved oxygen tension of 15% and over, the activity peak appeared at 25 h of cultivation, whereas the peak was delayed to 34 and 50 h with 5 and 0% dissolved oxygen tension, respectively. After reaching the maximum, the 7 beta-hydroxylation activity in the mycelium declined rapidly at pH 7.0, but the decline was retarded by increasing the pH to 8.0. Several combinations of operations, such as pH shift (from pH 7 to 8), addition of 0.5 M KCl, and dissolved oxygen control, were applied to the production of ursodeoxycholic acid in a jar fermentor, and a much larger amount of ursodeoxycholic acid (1.2 g/liter) was produced within 96 h of cultivation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Expanding synthetic capabilities to routinely employ enzymes in organic solvents (OSs) is a dream for protein engineers and synthetic chemists. Despite significant advances in the field of protein engineering, general and transferable design principles to improve the OS resistance of enzymes are poorly understood. Herein, we report a combined computational and directed evolution study of Bacillus subtlis lipase A (BSLA) in three OSs (i. e., 1,4‐dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, 2,2,2‐trifluoroethanol) to devise a rational strategy to guide engineering OS resistant enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that OSs reduce BSLA activity and resistance in OSs by (i) stripping off essential water molecules from the BLSA surface mainly through H‐bonds binding; and (ii) penetrating the substrate binding cleft leading to inhibition and conformational change. Interestingly, integration of computational results with “BSLA‐SSM” variant library (3439 variants; all natural diversity with amino acid exchange) revealed two complementary rational design strategies: (i) surface charge engineering, and (ii) substrate binding cleft engineering. These strategies are most likely applicable to stabilize other lipases and enzymes and assist experimentalists to design organic solvent resistant enzymes with reduced time and screening effort in lab experiments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Readily available substituted phenols were coupled with pyruvate in buffer solution under atmospheric conditions to afford the corresponding para‐vinylphenol derivatives while releasing only one molecule of CO 2 and water as the by‐products. This transformation was achieved by designing a biocatalytic system that combines three biocatalytic steps, namely the CC coupling of phenol and pyruvate in the presence of ammonia, which leads to the corresponding tyrosine derivative, followed by deamination and decarboxylation. The biocatalytic transformation proceeded with high regioselectivity and afforded exclusively the desired para products. This method thus represents an environmentally friendly approach for the direct vinylation of readily available 2‐, 3‐, or 2,3‐disubstituted phenols on preparative scale (0.5 mmol) that provides vinylphenols in high yields (65–83 %).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Molecular modeling with classical force‐fields has been used to study the reactant complex and the tetrahedral intermediate in lipase‐catalyzed ester hydrolysis in 20 enzyme/substrate combinations. The R and S enantiomers of α‐methyldecanoic acid ester served as substrates for the wild‐type lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nine selected mutants. After suitable preparation of initial structures from an available wild‐type crystal structure, each system was subjected to 1 ns CHARMM force‐field molecular dynamics simulations. The resulting geometric and energetic changes allow interpretation of some experimentally observed effects of mutations, particularly with regard to the “hot spots” at residues 155 and 162. The replacement S155F enhances S enantiopreference through a steric relay involving Leu162. The double mutation S53P + L162G improves S enantioselectivity by creating a new binding pocket for the S enantiomer with an additional stabilizing hydrogen bond to His83. The simulations provide insight into remote and cooperative effects of mutations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stabilization of proteolytic enzymes, especially by immobilization, is of considerable interest because of their potential applications in medicine and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. We report here a detailed comparison of two procedures for trypsin immobilization using the same homobifunctional agent, glutaraldehyde, for the purpose of peptide mapping. These methods include covalent coupling either to controlled pore glass (solid support) or via a cross‐linking reaction (without any solid support). The immobilized trypsin preparations were characterized by the determination of immobilization efficiency, which ranged from 68 to > 95%, and measurement of apparent kinetic parameters toward a synthetic peptide‐like substrate. Batch digestions of whole denaturated human normal adult hemoglobin (HbA) were performed to obtain peptide maps by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). Migration time reproducibility of the CZE maps was excellent, with a mean relative standard deviation of 1.5%. Moreover, the two immobilized enzyme preparations showed excellent reproducibility for repeated digestions. Matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)‐mass spectrometry was also used for peptide mass mapping of denaturated HbA digested using the two immobilized trypsin preparations. Even though the two immobilized trypsin preparations do not behave identically, similar sequence coverages of 57% and 61% (for the two HbA chains merged) were achieved for the support‐based and cross‐linked trypsin preparations, respectively.",

Combining this racemization procedure with lipase‐catalyzed kinetic resolution led to the first lipase/metal‐integrated dynamic kinetic resolution of racemic axially chiral biaryl compounds. The method was applied to the synthesis of various enantio‐enriched C 1 ‐ and C 2 ‐symmetric biaryl diols in yields of up to 98 % and enantiomeric excesses of up to 98 %, which paves the way for new developments in the field of asymmetric synthesis.",

    "title": "Biocatalysis in Organic Synthesis: The Retrosynthesis Approach",
    "abstract": "The application of biocatalysis in organic synthesis is rapidly gaining popularity amongst chemists. Compared to traditional synthetic methodologies biocatalysis offers a number of advantages in terms of enhanced selectivity (chemo-, regio-, stereo-), reduced environmental impact and lower cost of starting materials. Together these advantages can contribute to more sustainable manufacturing processes across a wide range of industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to biofuels. The biocatalytic toolbox has expanded significantly in the past five years and given the current rate of development of new engineered biocatalysts it is likely that the number of available biocatalysts will double in the next few years. This textbook gives a comprehensive overview of the current biocatalytic toolbox and also establishes new guidelines or rules for “biocatalytic retrosynthesis”. Retrosynthesis is a well known and commonly used technique whereby organic chemists start with the structure of their target molecule and generate potential starting materials and intermediates through a series of retrosynthetic disconnections. These disconnections are then used to devise a forward synthesis, in this case using biocatalytic transformations in some of the key steps. Target molecules are disconnected with consideration for applying biocatalysts, as well as chemical reagents and chemocatalysts, in the forward synthesis direction. Using this textbook, students will be able to place biocatalysis within the context of other synthetic transformations that they have learned earlier in their studies. This additional awareness of biocatalysis will equip students for the modern world of organic synthesis where biocatalysts play an increasingly important role. In addition to guidelines for identifying where biocatalysts can be applied in organic synthesis, this textbook also provides examples of current applications of biocatalysis using worked examples and case studies. Tutorials enable the reader to practice disconnecting target molecules to find the ‘hidden’ biocatalytic reactions which can be applied in the synthetic direction. The book contains a complete description of the current biocatalyst classes that are available for use and also suggests areas where new enzymes are likely to be developed in the next few years. This textbook is an essential resource for lecturers and students studying synthetic organic chemistry. It also serves as a handy reference for practicing chemists who wish to embed biocatalysis into their synthetic toolbox.",

Although many methods have been developed for C–C bond construction, the stereoselective creation of new C–C bonds remains a challenge. The selectivities (enantioselectivity, regioselectivity, and chemoselectivity) of biocatalysts are higher than those of chemical catalysts, therefore biocatalysts are excellent candidates for use in stereoselective C–C bond formation. Here, we summarize progress made in the past 10 years in stereoselective C–C bond formation enabled by two classic types of enzyme, aldolases and hydroxynitrile lyases. The information in this review will enable the development of new routes to the stereoselective construction of C–C bonds.",

Programming the precise cellular response toward environmental pH is, therefore, crucial for engineering cells for increasingly sophisticated functions. Herein, we engineer a set of riboswitch-based pH-sensing genetic devices to enable the control of gene expression according to differential environmental pH. We next develop a digital pH-sensing system to utilize the analogue-sensing behavior of these devices for high-resolution recording of host cell exposure to discrete external pH levels. The application of this digital pH-sensing system is demonstrated in a genetic program that autonomously regulated the evolutionary engineering of host cells for improved tolerance to a broad spectrum of organic acids, a valuable phenotype for metabolic engineering and bioremediation applications.",

    "title": "Salt bridges: Geometrically specific, designable interactions",
    "abstract": "Abstract Salt bridges occur frequently in proteins, providing conformational specificity and contributing to molecular recognition and catalysis. We present a comprehensive analysis of these interactions in protein structures by surveying a large database of protein structures. Salt bridges between Asp or Glu and His, Arg, or Lys display extremely well‐defined geometric preferences. Several previously observed preferences are confirmed, and others that were previously unrecognized are discovered. Salt bridges are explored for their preferences for different separations in sequence and in space, geometric preferences within proteins and at protein–protein interfaces, co‐operativity in networked salt bridges, inclusion within metal‐binding sites, preference for acidic electrons, apparent conformational side chain entropy reduction on formation, and degree of burial. Salt bridges occur far more frequently between residues at close than distant sequence separations, but, at close distances, there remain strong preferences for salt bridges at specific separations. Specific types of complex salt bridges, involving three or more members, are also discovered. As we observe a strong relationship between the propensity to form a salt bridge and the placement of salt‐bridging residues in protein sequences, we discuss the role that salt bridges might play in kinetically influencing protein folding and thermodynamically stabilizing the native conformation. We also develop a quantitative method to select appropriate crystal structure resolution and B‐factor cutoffs. Detailed knowledge of these geometric and sequence dependences should aid de novo design and prediction algorithms. Proteins 2011. © 2010 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

    "title": "Evidence for microscopic, long-range hydration forces for a hydrophobic amino acid",
    "abstract": "We have combined neutron solution scattering experiments with molecular dynamics simulation to isolate an excess experimental signal that is caused solely by N-acetyl-leucine-amide (NALA) correlations in aqueous solution. This excess signal contains information about how NALA molecule centers are correlated in water, and we show how these solute–solute correlations might be determined at dilute concentrations in the small angle region. We have tested qualitatively different pair distribution functions for NALA molecule centers—gas, cluster, and aqueous forms of g c (r) —and have found that the excess experimental signal is adequate enough to rule out gas and cluster pair distribution functions. The aqueous form of g c (r) that exhibits a solvent-separated minimum, and possibly longer-ranged correlations as well, is not only physically sound but reproduces the experimental data reasonably well. This work demonstrates that important information in the small angle region can be mined to resolve solute–solute correlations, their lengthscales, and thermodynamic consequences even at dilute concentrations. The hydration forces that operate on the microscopic scale of individual amino acid side chains, implied by the small angle scattering data, could have significant effects on the early stages of protein folding, on ligand binding, and on other intermolecular interactions.",

Since their discovery, stereocomplementary IREDs have been applied to the production of both ( S ) and ( R ) cyclic secondary amines, and the expansion in gene sequences recently identified has hinted at new substrate ranges that extend into acyclic imines and even suggest the possibility of asymmetric reductive amination from suitable ketone and amine precursors. Structural studies of various IREDs are beginning to reveal the complexities inherent in determining substrate range, stereoselectivity and mechanism in these enzymes, which represent a valuable emerging addition to the toolbox of available biocatalysts for chiral amine production.",

Enzymes catalyze such reactions with exquisite selectivity which often cannot be achieved using non‐biological methods but may suffer from an intolerance of high temperature and the presence of organic solvents limiting their applications.

This enzyme is shown to catalyze [4+2] cycloadditions at elevated temperature (up to 65 °C), and in the presence of organic solvents (MeOH, CH 3 CN and DMSO) and the chemical denaturant guanidinium hydrochloride, revealing that AbyU has potential widespread value as a biocatalyst.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Obtaining optically pure compounds in an eco‐friendly and cost‐efficient manner plays an important role in human health and pharmaceutical industry. Racemic separation using multistage stereoselective liquid–liquid extraction has become one of the most practical and effective approach to access homochiral enantiomers. Currently, chiral ionic liquids (CILs) with structural designability have become a promising chiral additive and enable them as adjustable candidates for racemic separation. Herein, a high‐effective stereoselective liquid–liquid extraction process composed of imidazolium cations and amino acid‐derived anions as the chiral additive was established for racemic 2‐cyclohexylmandelic acid (CHMA) separation. We have systematically investigated the choice of organic solvent, concentration of CIL, extraction temperature, and the pH of aqueous phase. For three‐stage stereoselective extraction, the maximum enantiomeric excess ( e.e .) for CHMA was reached up to 40.6%. Furthermore, the mechanism of steric effect and stereoselective capacity between the CILs and racemic CHMA was discussed and simulated. We envision that the work will facilitate the development of CILs in multistage liquid–liquid extraction and promote the large‐scale production of optically pure enantiomers.",

All polymeric materials eventually deteriorate and degrade over time due to changes in the inter‐ or intramolecular bonding resulting from biological and/or environmental exposure. Microorganisms use a combination of cellular hydrolytic and oxidative chemical processes to release carbon sources from polymers. Specifically, polyesters and polyurethanes are susceptible to hydrolysis by catabolic enzymes released by fungi, bacteria and archaea in the environment, and these polymer classes make up 35% of global polymer production.

    "title": "Solid‐State nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of solvent dependence of tyrosyl ring motion in an enzyme",
    "abstract": "Abstract Tyrosyl ring motions in α‐lytic protease were investigated by solid‐state deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in lyophilized enzyme powder, in powder suspended in organic solvents, and in aqueous crystals. Ring flipping rates were determined by examining deuterium quadrupole echo line shapes. Of the four Tyr residues in the enzyme, one was flipping at the slow (≤10 3 s −1 ) and one at the fast (≥10 7 s −1 ) exchange limit of the line shape experiment in all the environments tested. Flipping rates of the remaining two Tyr residues depended markedly on the solvent, with the lowest flipping rates (≤10 3 s −1 for both residues) observed in the enzyme powder, whether dry or suspended in hydrophobic tert ‐butyl methyl ether. In hydrophilic dioxane and acetonitrile, the mobility of these residues increased to 10 4 and 10 5 s −1 . The latter rate rose further to 10 6 s −1 in the hydrated hydrophilic solvents and to ≥10 7 s −1 in aqueous crystals. The deuterium spectrum of native α‐lytic protease was compared with that of the enzyme whose active center was covalently modified with an inhibitor, which binds next to Tyr‐123, constraining its ring. This experiment revealed that water addition to acetonitrile specifically increased the flipping rate of this active center residue. Librational motions (“wobbling”), estimated by their effect on spin–lattice relaxation times, were slowest in the anhydrous solvents, intermediate in the hydrated solvents, and fastest in the aqueous crystals. Thus, α‐lytic protease is more rigid in organic solvents than in water, as judged by mobility of its tyrosyl residues. Water stripping by hydrophilic solvents did not increase enzyme rigidity, nor were there clear correlations between mobility and either enzymatic activity or solvent dielectric constant. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

    "title": "Rules for optimization of biocatalysis in organic solvents",
    "abstract": "Abstract General rules for the optimization of different biocatalytic systems in various types of media containing organic solvents are derived by combining data from the literature, and the logarithm of the partition coefficient, log P , as a quantitative measure of solvent polarity. (1) Biocatalysis in organic solvents is low in polar solvents having a log P < 2, is moderate in solvents having a log P between 2 and 4, and is high in a polar solvents having a log P > 4. It was found that this correlation between polarity and activity parallels the ability of organic solvents to distort the essential water layer that stabilizes the biocatalysts. (2) Further optimization of biocatalysis in organic solvents is achieved when the polarity of the microenvironment of the biocatalyst (log P i ) and the continuous organic phase (log P cph ) is tuned to the polarities of both the substrate (log P s ) and the product (log P p ) according to the following rules: |log P i − log P s | and |log P cph − log P p | should be minimal and |log P cph − log P s | and |log P i − log P p | should be maximal, with the exception that in the case of substrate inhibition log P i , should be optimized with respect to log P s In addition to these simple optimization rules, the future developments of biocatalysis in organic solvents are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants produce various prenylated phenolic metabolites, including flavonoids, phloroglucinols, and coumarins, many of which have multiple prenyl moieties and display various biological activities. Prenylated phenylpropanes, such as artepillin C (3,5-diprenyl- p -coumaric acid), exhibit a broad range of pharmaceutical effects. To date, however, no prenyltransferases (PTs) involved in the biosynthesis of phenylpropanes and no plant enzymes that introduce multiple prenyl residues to native substrates with different regio-specificities have been identified. This study describes the isolation from Artemisia capillaris of a phenylpropane-specific PT gene, AcPT1 , belonging to UbiA superfamily. This gene encodes a membrane-bound enzyme, which accepts p -coumaric acid as its specific substrate and transfers two prenyl residues stepwise to yield artepillin C. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular evolution of this gene family, contributing to the chemical diversification of plant specialized metabolites. These results also enabled the design of a yeast platform for the synthetic biology of artepillin C.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Racemic α‐chiral primary amines were deracemised to optically pure amines in up to >99 % conversion and >99 % ee within 48 h. The deracemisation was a result of a stereoinversion of one amine enantiomer; the formal stereoinversion was achieved by a one‐pot, two‐step procedure: in the first step, kinetic resolution of the chiral racemic amine was performed by employing a ω‐transaminase to yield an intermediate ketone and the remaining optically pure amine; in the second step, the ketone intermediate was stereoselectively transformed into the amine by employing alanine as the amine donor and a ω‐transaminase displaying opposite stereopreference than the ω‐transaminase in the first step. In the second step, lactate dehydrogenase was used to remove the side product pyruvate to shift the unfavourable reaction equilibrium to the product side. Depending on the order of the enantiocomplementary enzymes employed in the cascade, the ( R ), as well as the ( S ), enantiomer was accessible.(© Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This minireview focuses on the production of chiral compounds by using dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) and related sequential reactions, utilizing heterogeneous and immobilized metal catalysts and enzymes. Enzymes, especially lipases, often possess high chemical, stereo‐, and regiospecificities under mild reaction conditions. Supported transition‐metal catalysts are effective and widely used for various chemical transformations including racemization and hydrogenation reactions. This minireview discusses both the early and important applications, as well as modern state‐of‐the‐art processes, in which different catalyst combinations are utilized. Also catalyst compatibility issues, including catalyst inhibition and applicability are addressed with specific focus on the racemization catalysts applied in DKRs. Finally, some examples on the utilization of heterogeneous catalysts in flow reactors are presented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The MGnify platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) facilitates the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome-derived nucleic acid sequences. The platform provides access to taxonomic assignments and functional annotations for nearly half a million analyses covering metabarcoding, metatranscriptomic, and metagenomic datasets, which are derived from a wide range of different environments. Over the past 3 years, MGnify has not only grown in terms of the number of datasets contained but also increased the breadth of analyses provided, such as the analysis of long-read sequences. The MGnify protein database now exceeds 2.4 billion non-redundant sequences predicted from metagenomic assemblies. This collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. To extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in MGnify, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods. The technology underlying MGnify's Application Programming Interface (API) and website has been upgraded, and we have enabled the ability to perform downstream analysis of the MGnify data through the introduction of a coupled Jupyter Lab environment.",

    "title": "Whole-cell bioreduction of aromatic α-keto esters using Candida tenuis xylose reductase and Candida boidinii formate dehydrogenase co-expressed in Escherichia coli",
    "abstract": "Abstract Background Whole cell-catalyzed biotransformation is a clear process option for the production of chiral alcohols via enantioselective reduction of precursor ketones. A wide variety of synthetically useful reductases are expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli to a high level of activity. Therefore, this microbe has become a prime system for carrying out whole-cell bioreductions at different scales. The limited capacity of central metabolic pathways in E. coli usually requires that reductase coenzyme in the form of NADPH or NADH be regenerated through a suitable oxidation reaction catalyzed by a second NADP + or NAD + dependent dehydrogenase that is co-expressed. Candida tenuis xylose reductase ( Ct XR) was previously shown to promote NADH dependent reduction of aromatic α-keto esters with high Prelog-type stereoselectivity. We describe here the development of a new whole-cell biocatalyst that is based on an E. coli strain co-expressing Ct XR and formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii ( Cb FDH). The bacterial system was evaluated for the synthesis of ethyl R -4-cyanomandelate under different process conditions and benchmarked against a previously described catalyst derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing Ct XR. Results Gene co-expression from a pETDuet-1 vector yielded about 260 and 90 units of intracellular Ct XR and Cb FDH activity per gram of dry E. coli cell mass (g CDW ). The maximum conversion rate ( r S ) for ethyl 4-cyanobenzoylformate by intact or polymyxin B sulphate-permeabilized cells was similar (2 mmol/g CDW h), suggesting that the activity of Cb FDH was partly rate-limiting overall. Uncatalyzed ester hydrolysis in substrate as well as inactivation of Ct XR and Cb FDH in the presence of the α-keto ester constituted major restrictions to the yield of alcohol product. Using optimized reaction conditions (100 mM substrate; 40 g CDW /L), we obtained ethyl R -4-cyanomandelate with an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 97.2% in a yield of 82%. By increasing the substrate concentration to 500 mM, the e.e. could be enhanced to ≅100%, however, at the cost of a 3-fold decreased yield. A recombinant strain of S. cerevisiae converted 100 mM substrate to 45 mM ethyl R -4-cyanomandelate with an e.e. of ≥ 99.9%. Modifications to the recombinant E. coli (cell permeabilisation; addition of exogenous NAD + ) and addition of a water immiscible solvent (e.g. hexane or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate) were not useful. To enhance the overall capacity for NADH regeneration in the system, we supplemented the original biocatalyst after permeabilisation with also permeabilised E. coli cells that expressed solely Cb FDH (410 U/g CDW ). The positive effect on yield (18% → 62%; 100 mM substrate) caused by a change in the ratio of FDH to XR activity from 2 to 20 was invalidated by a corresponding loss in product enantiomeric purity from 86% to only 71%. Conclusion A whole-cell system based on E. coli co-expressing Ct XR and Cb FDH is a powerful and surprisingly robust biocatalyst for the synthesis of ethyl R -4-cyanomandelate in high optical purity and yield. A clear requirement for further optimization of the specific productivity of the biocatalyst is to remove the kinetic bottleneck of NADH regeneration through enhancement (≥ 10-fold) of the intracellular level of FDH activity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Peroxygenases are heme‐dependent enzymes that use peroxide‐borne oxygen to catalyze a wide range of oxyfunctionalization reactions. Herein, we report the engineering of an unusual cofactor‐independent peroxygenase based on a promiscuous tautomerase that accepts different hydroperoxides ( t ‐BuOOH and H 2 O 2 ) to accomplish enantiocomplementary epoxidations of various α,β‐unsaturated aldehydes (citral and substituted cinnamaldehydes), providing access to both enantiomers of the corresponding α,β‐epoxy‐aldehydes. High conversions (up to 98 %), high enantioselectivity (up to 98 % ee ), and good product yields (50–80 %) were achieved. The reactions likely proceed via a reactive enzyme‐bound iminium ion intermediate, allowing tweaking of the enzyme's activity and selectivity by protein engineering. Our results underscore the potential of catalytic promiscuity for the engineering of new cofactor‐independent oxidative enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nucleotide sugars are considered as bottleneck and expensive substrates for enzymatic glycan synthesis using Leloir‐glycosyltransferases. Synthesis from cheap substrates such as monosaccharides is accomplished by multi‐enzyme cascade reactions. Optimization of product yields in such enzyme modules is dependent on the interplay of multiple parameters of the individual enzymes and governed by a considerable time effort when convential analytic methods like capillary electrophoresis (CE) or HPLC are applied. We here demonstrate for the first time multiplexed CE (MP‐CE) as fast analytical tool for the optimization of nucleotide sugar synthesis with multi‐enzyme cascade reactions. We introduce a universal separation method for nucleotides and nucleotide sugars enabling us to analyze the composition of six different enzyme modules in a high‐throughput format. Optimization of parameters ( T , pH, inhibitors, kinetics, cofactors and enzyme amount) employing MP‐CE analysis is demonstrated for enzyme modules for the synthesis of UDP‐α‐D‐glucuronic acid (UDP‐GlcA) and UDP‐α‐D‐galactose (UDP‐Gal). In this way we achieve high space‐time‐yields: 1.8 g/L⋆h for UDP‐GlcA and 17 g/L⋆h for UDP‐Gal. The presented MP‐CE methodology has the impact to be used as general analytical tool for fast optimization of multi‐enzyme cascade reactions.",

Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind’s Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek et al . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. —VV",

    "title": "Enzyme–magnetic nanoparticle hybrids: new effective catalysts for the production of high value chemicals",
    "abstract": "Abstract Magnetic nanoparticles (5–100 nm in diameter) offer the science community a new dimension in many key areas of research, notably nano‐medicine. However, use as catalyst support material (including enzyme immobilization) has largely been overlooked despite the benefits of a facile catalyst separation post‐reaction with reuse through the application of an external magnetic field. This is largely due to the high cost associated with magnetic nanoparticle synthesis in addition to enzyme operating costs. This can, however, be compensated for by effective catalyst recycling in the production of high value chemicals, particularly chiral drugs and their intermediates, circumventing laborious multi‐stage separation and purification procedures in conventional synthesis. Indeed, enzymes (such as lipase) on magnetic carriers have shown prolonged activity in organic solvents, even after recycling, when compared with free enzymes. Further developments can be directed at multi‐functional magnetic nanoparticles with the creation of a reactant‐specific micro‐environment to facilitate multi‐stepped reactions. The potential of enzyme‐magnetic nanoparticle hybrids is discussed and applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals, including precursors for drugs, are identified.

Fermentative opiate production in microbes has also been investigated, and complete biosynthesis of opiates from a simple carbon source has recently been accomplished in yeast. Here we demonstrate that Escherichia coli serves as an efficient, robust and flexible platform for total opiate synthesis. Thebaine, the most important raw material in opioid preparations, is produced by stepwise culture of four engineered strains at yields of 2.1 mg l −1 from glycerol, corresponding to a 300-fold increase from recently developed yeast systems. This improvement is presumably due to strong activity of enzymes related to thebaine synthesis from ( R )-reticuline in E. coli . Furthermore, by adding two genes to the thebaine production system, we demonstrate the biosynthesis of hydrocodone, a clinically important opioid. Improvements in opiate production in this E. coli system represent a major step towards the development of alternative opiate production systems.",

The new haloalkane dehalogenase DmxA originating from the psychrophilic bacterium Marinobacter sp. ELB17 surprisingly possesses the highest thermal stability (apparent melting temperature Tm,app = 65.9 °C) of all biochemically characterized wild type haloalkane dehalogenases belonging to subfamily II. The enzyme was successfully expressed and its crystal structure was solved at 1.45 Å resolution. DmxA structure contains several features distinct from known members of haloalkane dehalogenase family: (i) a unique composition of catalytic residues; (ii) a dimeric state mediated by a disulfide bridge; and (iii) narrow tunnels connecting the enzyme active site with the surrounding solvent. The importance of narrow tunnels in such paradoxically high stability of DmxA enzyme was confirmed by computational protein design and mutagenesis experiments.",

Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of millions of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K , which is typically of similar order as N , resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N . We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N , independent of K . It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50% sequence identity, >1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases.",

We focus on Rhodococcus cell immobilization in detail (methods of immobilization, criteria for strains and carriers, and optimization of process parameters) as the most efficient approach for stabilizing biocatalysts. It is shown that advanced Rhodococcus biocatalysts with improved working characteristics, enhanced stress tolerance, high catalytic activities, human and environment friendly, and commercially viable are developed, which are suitable for wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and biofuel production.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme instability is an important limitation for the investigation and application of enzymes. Therefore, methods to rapidly and effectively improve enzyme stability are highly appealing. In this study we applied a computational method (FRESCO) to guide the engineering of an alcohol dehydrogenase. Of the 177 selected mutations, 25 mutations brought about a significant increase in apparent melting temperature (ΔTm ≥ +3 °C). By combining mutations, a 10-fold mutant was generated with a Tm of 94 °C (+51 °C relative to wild type), almost reaching water’s boiling point, and the highest increase with FRESCO to date. The 10-fold mutant’s structure was elucidated, which enabled the identification of an activity-impairing mutation. After reverting this mutation, the enzyme showed no loss in activity compared to wild type, while displaying a Tm of 88 °C (+45 °C relative to wild type). This work demonstrates the value of enzyme stabilization through computational library design.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The self‐sufficient cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP505E3 from Aspergillus terreus catalyzes the regioselective in‐chain hydroxylation of alkanes, fatty alcohols, and fatty acids at the ω‐7 position. It is the first reported P450 to give regioselective in‐chain ω‐7 hydroxylation of C10–C16 n ‐alkanes, thereby enabling the one step biocatalytic synthesis of rare alcohols such as 5‐dodecanol and 7‐tetradecanol. It shows more than 70 % regioselectivity for the eighth carbon from one methyl terminus, and displays remarkably high activity towards decane (TTN≈8000) and dodecane (TTN≈2000). CYP505E3 can be used to synthesize the high‐value flavour compound δ‐dodecalactone via two routes: 1) conversion of dodecanoic acid into 5‐hydroxydodecanoic acid (24 % regioselectivity), which at low pH lactonises to δ‐dodecalactone, and 2) conversion of 1‐dodecanol into 1,5‐dodecanediol (55 % regioselectivity), which can be converted into δ‐dodecalactone by horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We report the crystal structure of a thermophilic “ene” reductase (TOYE) isolated from Thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus E39. The crystal structure reveals a tetrameric enzyme and an active site that is relatively large compared to most other structurally determined and related Old Yellow Enzymes. The enzyme adopts higher order oligomeric states (octamers and dodecamers) in solution, as revealed by sedimentation velocity and multiangle laser light scattering. Bead modelling indicates that the solution structure is consistent with the basic tetrameric structure observed in crystallographic studies and electron microscopy. TOYE is stable at high temperatures ( T m >70 °C) and shows increased resistance to denaturation in water‐miscible organic solvents compared to the mesophilic Old Yellow Enzyme family member, pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase. TOYE has typical ene‐reductase properties of the Old Yellow Enzyme family. There is currently major interest in using Old Yellow Enzyme family members in the preparative biocatalysis of a number of activated alkenes. The increased stability of TOYE in organic solvents is advantageous for biotransformations in which water‐miscible organic solvents and biphasic reaction conditions are required to both deliver novel substrates and minimize product racemisation.",

Here, biobased higher alcohols such as isobutanol are versatile platform molecules for the synthesis of chemical commodities and fuels. Currently, their fermentation‐based production is limited by the low tolerance of microbial production systems to the end products and also by the low substrate flux into cell metabolism. We developed an innovative cell‐free approach, utilizing an artificial minimized glycolytic reaction cascade that only requires one single coenzyme. Using this toolbox the cell‐free production of ethanol and isobutanol from glucose was achieved. We also confirmed that these streamlined cascades functioned under conditions at which microbial production would have ceased. Our system can be extended to an array of industrially‐relevant molecules. Application of solvent‐tolerant biocatalysts potentially allows for high product yields, which significantly simplifies downstream product recovery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Therapeutic RNA oligonucleotides have shown tremendous potential to manage and treat disease, yet current manufacturing methods cannot deliver on this promise. Here, we report the development and optimization of a novel, aqueous-based, template-independent enzymatic RNA oligonucleotide synthesis platform as an alternative to traditional chemical methodologies. Our platform is made possible by reversible terminator nucleoside triphosphates and an enzyme capable of their incorporation. We show that many common therapeutic RNA modifications are compatible with our process and demonstrate the enzymatic synthesis of natural and modified oligonucleotides in both liquid and solid phases. Our platform offers many unique advantages over chemical synthesis, including the realization of a more sustainable process to produce therapeutic RNA oligonucleotides. One-Sentence Summary An enzyme and novel nucleotide building blocks are used to synthesize RNA oligonucleotides template independently under aqueous conditions.",

All plants have a nitrilase 4 homolog specific for ß-cyanoalanine, while in some plants neofunctionalization has produced nitrilases with altered specificity. Plant nitrilase substrate size and specificity correlate with helical twist, but molecular details of this relationship are lacking. Here we determine, to our knowledge, the first close-to-atomic resolution (3.4 Å) cryo-EM structure of an active helical nitrilase, the nitrilase 4 from Arabidopsis thaliana . We apply site-saturation mutagenesis directed evolution to three residues (R95, S224, and L169) and generate a mutant with an altered helical twist that accepts substrates not catalyzed by known plant nitrilases. We reveal that a loop between α2 and α3 limits the length of the binding pocket and propose that it shifts position as a function of helical twist. These insights will allow us to start designing nitrilases for chemoenzymatic synthesis.",

    "abstract": "El presente artículo busca conjugar un estudio analítico de una fuente literaria abordada desde la perspectiva teológica, con el fin de dilucidar la concepción religiosa que el autor entrevera en la novela Pedro Páramo. No pocos acercamientos se han hecho al opus magnum de Juan Rulfo, contemplados todos de las diversificadas aristas que su obra ofrece, siendo la lectura en clave teológica la que se había escapado a las diversas interpretaciones. Siguiendo el método concéntrico, partiendo de lo general a un marco más estrecho, este ensayo hermenéutico pretende abordar estadios y estatutos teológicos que acontecen al estadio mortuorio del ser humano. Como fruto de este análisis podemos contemplar que se pueden explicitar los contenidos de las verdades reveladas de la teología católica que laten en el fondo de esta obra literaria, que sin pretensión de ser de tinte religioso, brinda un yacimiento inexplorado de la religiosidad subjetiva de Rulfo, que no por ello debe desdeñarse. Por ser una temática que había escapado al análisis acucioso de los analistas, la bibliografía referente es escasísima, empero, la hermenéutica de los datos seleccionados de la antedicha novela pudieron ser ampliados con la abundante producción bibliográfica que al respecto ofrece la teología católica.",

The activity was highly dependent on the nature of the support material and on the amount of water present in the reaction mixture. There appears to be competition for the water in the system between the enzyme, the support material and the solvent. The support materials were characterized by measuring their ability to absorb water from water‐saturated diisopropyl ether. For the quotient: (amount of water on the support)/(amount of water in the solvent) in the model system the term aquaphilicity was proposed. The activity of adsorbed chymotrypsin in diisopropyl ether decreased with increasing aquaphilicity of the support material. The same trend was observed when the activity of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase adsorbed on different supports was measured in diisopropyl ether.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Optically active amines and amino acids play an important role in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and chemical industries. They are frequently used as synthons for the preparation of various pharmaceutically active substances and agrochemicals, but also as resolving agents to obtain chiral carboxylic acids. Consequently, there is a need for efficient methods to obtain the desired enantiomer of a given target structure in optically pure form. Beside a range of chemical methods using for example, asymmetric synthesis with transition metal catalysts, enzymes represent a useful alternative to access this important class of compounds. This review covers biocatalytic approaches using hydrolases (i.e. lipases, amidases), monoamine oxidase and other enzymes. Special focus is given on the application of ω‐transaminases with emphasis on concepts to allow efficient asymmetric synthesis starting from prostereogenic ketones.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The creation of novel enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Here we describe two new algorithms for enzyme design that employ hashing techniques to allow searching through large numbers of protein scaffolds for optimal catalytic site placement. We also describe an in silico benchmark, based on the recapitulation of the active sites of native enzymes, that allows rapid evaluation and testing of enzyme design methodologies. In the benchmark test, which consists of designing sites for each of 10 different chemical reactions in backbone scaffolds derived from 10 enzymes catalyzing the reactions, the new methods succeed in identifying the native site in the native scaffold and ranking it within the top five designs for six of the 10 reactions. The new methods can be directly applied to the design of new enzymes, and the benchmark provides a powerful in silico test for guiding improvements in computational enzyme design.",

The fdhF gene contains, within an open reading frame coding for a protein of 715 amino acids (calculated molecular weight, 79,087), an opal (UGA) nonsense codon in amino acid position 140. Existence of this nonsense codon was confirmed by physical recloning and resequencing. Internal and terminal deletion clones and lacZ fusions of different N-terminal parts of fdhF were constructed and analyzed for selenium incorporation. Selenylated truncated polypeptide chains or beta-galactosidase fusion proteins were synthesized when the deletion clones or gene fusions, respectively, contained the fdhF gene fragment coding for the selenopolypeptide sequence from amino acid residue 129 to amino acid residue 268. Translation of the lacZ part of the fusions required the presence of selenium in the medium when the N-terminal fdhF part contained the UGA codon and was independent of the presence of selenium when a more upstream part of fdhF was fused to lacZ. The results are consistent with a co-translational selenocysteine incorporation mechanism.",

Thus, our first biotechnological product is fully integrated into the main product stream of Lonza's chemical production. ii) L-Carnitine (3) is synthesized by stereospecific hydroxylation of 4-butyrobetaine (4) in a β-oxidation process analogous to fatty-acid degradation. L-Carnitine (3) is a vitamin-like substance with interesting physiological capacities. Both processes are based on interrupted catabolic pathways of microbial origin.

    "abstract": "The unprecedented performance of Deepmind’s Alphafold2 in predicting protein structure in CASP XIV and the creation of a database of structures for multiple proteomes and protein sequence repositories is reshaping structural biology. However, because this database returns a single structure, it brought into question Alphafold’s ability to capture the intrinsic conformational flexibility of proteins. Here we present a general approach to drive Alphafold2 to model alternate protein conformations through simple manipulation of the multiple sequence alignment via in silico mutagenesis. The approach is grounded in the hypothesis that the multiple sequence alignment must also encode for protein structural heterogeneity, thus its rational manipulation will enable Alphafold2 to sample alternate conformations. A systematic modeling pipeline is benchmarked against canonical examples of protein conformational flexibility and applied to interrogate the conformational landscape of membrane proteins. This work broadens the applicability of Alphafold2 by generating multiple protein conformations to be tested biologically, biochemically, biophysically, and for use in structure-based drug design.",

We demonstrate direct inference of full atomic-level protein structure from primary sequence using a large language model. As language models of protein sequences are scaled up to 15 billion parameters, an atomic-resolution picture of protein structure emerges in the learned representations. This results in an order-of-magnitude acceleration of high-resolution structure prediction, which enables large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins. We apply this capability to construct the ESM Metagenomic Atlas by predicting structures for >617 million metagenomic protein sequences, including >225 million that are predicted with high confidence, which gives a view into the vast breadth and diversity of natural proteins.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An increasing demand for non‐petroleum‐based products is envisaged in the near future. Carboxylic acids such as citric acid, succinic acid, fatty acids, and many others are available in abundance from renewable resources and they could serve as economic precursors for bio‐based products such as polymers, aldehyde building blocks, and alcohols. However, we are confronted with the problem that carboxylic acid reduction requires a high level of energy for activation due to the carboxylate's thermodynamic stability. Catalytic processes are scarce and often their chemoselectivity is insufficient. This review points at bio‐alternatives: currently known enzyme classes and organisms that catalyze the reduction of carboxylic acids are summarized. Two totally distinct biocatalyst lines have evolved to catalyze the same reaction: aldehyde oxidoreductases from anaerobic bacteria and archea, and carboxylate reductases from aerobic sources such as bacteria, fungi, and plants. The majority of these enzymes remain to be identified and isolated from their natural background in order to evaluate their potential as industrial biocatalysts.",

CARs demonstrated amidation activity for various acids and amines. Optimization of reaction conditions, with respect to pH and temperature, allowed for the synthesis of the anticonvulsant ilepcimide with up to 96 % conversion. Mechanistic studies using site‐directed mutagenesis suggest that, following initial enzymatic adenylation of substrates, amidation of the carboxylic acid proceeds by direct reaction of the acyl adenylate with amine nucleophiles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nature provides an inexhaustible diversity of small organic molecules with beautiful molecular architectures that have strong and selective inhibitory activities. However, this tremendous biomedical potential often remains inaccessible, as the structural complexity of natural products can render their synthetic preparation extremely challenging. This problem is addressable by harnessing the biocatalytic procedures evolved by nature. In this work, we present an enzymatic total synthesis of ikarugamycin. The use of an iterative PKS/NRPS machinery and two reductases has allowed the construction of 15 carbon–carbon and 2 carbon–nitrogen bonds in a biocatalytic one‐pot reaction. By scaling‐up this method we demonstrate the applicability of biocatalytic approaches for the ex vivo synthesis of complex natural products.",

The catalysts used for creating carbon-silicon bonds, however, often require expensive trace metals or have limited lifetimes. Borrowing from the ability of some metallo-enzymes to catalyze other rare carbene insertion reactions, Kan et al. used heme proteins to form carbon-silicon bonds across a range of conditions and substrates (see the Perspective by Klare and Oestreich).

    "abstract": "Abstract Fluorescence‐activated cell sorting (FACS) offers a powerful approach to high‐throughput library screening in directed evolution experiments. However, FACS is rarely used in the evolution of stereoselective enzymes, due to the difficulty of designing fluorescence‐based assays for measuring enantiopurity. Here, we describe a new FACS‐based enantiopurity analysis approach that overcomes these limitations by using enantiomeric DNA biosensors labeled with orthogonal fluorophores. By co‐encapsulating the biosensors with a mixture of target enantiomers in microfluidic droplets, we could demonstrate the use of FACS to differentiate between droplets having various levels of target enantiopurity. We envision the utility of this method for high‐throughput screening of enantiopurity in the directed evolution of stereoselective enzymes, thereby facilitating the discovery of new asymmetric biocatalysts for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other high‐value chemicals.",

Its physical and chemical properties, such as its low miscibility with water, boiling point, remarkable stability compared to other cyclic‐based solvents such as THF, and others make it appealing for applications in syntheses involving organometallics, organocatalysis, and biotransformations or for processing lignocellulosic materials. Interestingly, a significant number of industries have also started to assess 2‐MeTHF in several synthetic procedures, often with excellent results and prospects. Likewise, preliminary toxicology assessments suggest that the use of 2‐MeTHF might even be extended to more processes in pharmaceutical chemistry. This Minireview describes the properties of 2‐MeTHF, the state‐of‐the‐art of its use in synthesis, and covers several outstanding examples of its application from both industry and academia.",

Valuable research outputs that are often locked up in figures and supplementary information files are encapsulated in Rfam entries and made accessible through the Rfam Web site. The data produced by Rfam have a broad application, from genome annotation to providing training sets for algorithm development.

    "title": "A Catalytic Nanoreactor Based on in Vivo Encapsulation of Multiple Enzymes in an Engineered Protein Nanocompartment",
    "abstract": "Abstract Bacterial protein compartments concentrate and sequester enzymes, thereby regulating biochemical reactions. Here, we generated a new functional nanocompartment in Escherichia coli by engineering the MS2 phage capsid protein to encapsulate multiple cargo proteins. Sequestration of multiple proteins in MS2‐based capsids was achieved by SpyTag/SpyCatcher protein fusions that covalently crosslinked with the interior surface of the capsid. Further, the functional two‐enzyme indigo biosynthetic pathway could be targeted to the engineered capsids, leading to a 60 % increase in indigo production in vivo. The enzyme‐loaded particles could be purified in their active form and showed enhanced long‐term stability in vitro (about 95 % activity after seven days) compared with free enzymes (about 5 % activity after seven days). In summary, this engineered in vivo encapsulation system provides a simple and versatile way for generating highly stable multi‐enzyme nanoreactors for in vivo and in vitro applications.",

    "title": "The Microwave‐to‐Flow Paradigm: Translating High‐Temperature Batch Microwave Chemistry to Scalable Continuous‐Flow Processes",
    "abstract": "Abstract The popularity of dedicated microwave reactors in many academic and industrial laboratories has produced a plethora of synthetic protocols that are based on this enabling technology. In the majority of examples, transformations that require several hours when performed using conventional heating under reflux conditions reach completion in a few minutes or even seconds in sealed‐vessel, autoclave‐type, microwave reactors. However, one severe drawback of microwave chemistry is the difficulty in scaling this technology to a production‐scale level. This Concept article demonstrates that this limitation can be overcome by translating batch microwave chemistry to scalable continuous‐flow processes. For this purpose, conventionally heated micro‐ or mesofluidic flow devices fitted with a back‐pressure regulator are employed, in which the high temperatures and pressures attainable in a sealed‐vessel microwave chemistry batch experiment can be mimicked.",

We investigated the nature of enantioselectivity in closely related mutant ketoreductases that reduce almost-symmetrical 3-oxacyclopentanone and 3-thiacyclopentanone, which are difficult to reduce enantioselectively by other means. We present the efficiencies of select variants and their crystallographic structures. Our experimental and theoretical studies reveal how mutations modulate the stereoselectivity of the reduction. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Michaelis–Menten and transition state-bound complexes were used to rationalize the observed stereochemical outcomes. We discovered that the closed conformation of the flexible substrate binding loop is likely the catalytically active one imparting the stereochemical preferences. Our molecular dynamics approach reveals how each enzyme stabilizes the diastereomeric transition structures by altering the active site size.",

Solvents of this type combine the great advantages of other proposed environmentally benign alternative solvents, such as low toxicity, high availability, low inflammability, high recyclability, low volatility, and low price, avoiding many disadvantages of the more modern media. The fact that many of the components of these mixtures come directly from nature assures their biodegradability and renewability.

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, a novel medium with similar properties to ionic liquids but with additional advantages regarding cost, environmental impact, and synthesis has been developed: deep eutectic solvents (DESs). These solvents result from the association between an organic salt (ammonium or phosphonium) with a hydrogen‐bond donor such as alcohols, acids, or amides. To date, the availability of green, inexpensive and easy to handle solvents is almost non‐existent. Therefore, DESs currently arouse growing interest in many research fields. This review deals with the major applications of this new family of solvents with a particular focus on lipase‐catalyzed reactions such as hydrolysis, aminolysis, or alcoholysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Polyketides produced by modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) play eminent roles in the development of medicines. Yet, the production of structural analogs by genetic engineering poses a major challenge. We report an evolution-guided morphing of modular PKSs inspired by recombination processes that lead to structural diversity in nature. By deletion and insertion of PKS modules we interconvert the assembly lines for related antibiotic and antifungal agents, aureothin ( aur ) and neoaureothin ( nor ) (aka spectinabilin), in both directions. Mutational and functional analyses of the polyketide-tailoring cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, and PKS phylogenies give contradictory clues on potential evolutionary scenarios (generalist-to-specialist enzyme evolution vs . most parsimonious ancestor). The KS-AT linker proves to be well suited as fusion site for both excision and insertion of modules, which supports a model for alternative module boundaries in some PKS systems. This study teaches important lessons on the evolution of PKSs, which may guide future engineering approaches.",

    "title": "Isolation of a Novel Cutinase Homolog with Polyethylene Terephthalate-Degrading Activity from Leaf-Branch Compost by Using a Metagenomic Approach",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The gene encoding a cutinase homolog, LC-cutinase, was cloned from a fosmid library of a leaf-branch compost metagenome by functional screening using tributyrin agar plates. LC-cutinase shows the highest amino acid sequence identity of 59.7% to Thermomonospora curvata lipase. It also shows the 57.4% identity to Thermobifida fusca cutinase. When LC-cutinase without a putative signal peptide was secreted to the periplasm of Escherichia coli cells with the assistance of the pelB leader sequence, more than 50% of the recombinant protein, termed LC-cutinase*, was excreted into the extracellular medium. It was purified and characterized. LC-cutinase* hydrolyzed various fatty acid monoesters with acyl chain lengths of 2 to 18, with a preference for short-chain substrates (C 4 substrate at most) most optimally at pH 8.5 and 50°C, but could not hydrolyze olive oil. It lost activity with half-lives of 40 min at 70°C and 7 min at 80°C. LC-cutinase* had an ability to degrade poly(ε-caprolactone) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The specific PET-degrading activity of LC-cutinase* was determined to be 12 mg/h/mg of enzyme (2.7 mg/h/μkat of p NP-butyrate-degrading activity) at pH 8.0 and 50°C. This activity is higher than those of the bacterial and fungal cutinases reported thus far, suggesting that LC-cutinase* not only serves as a good model for understanding the molecular mechanism of PET-degrading enzyme but also is potentially applicable for surface modification and degradation of PET.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT A novel tightly regulated gene expression system was developed for Escherichia coli by applying the regulatory elements of the Pseudomonas putida F1 cym and cmt operons to control target gene expression at the transcriptional level by using p -isopropylbenzoate (cumate) as an inducer. This novel expression system, referred to as the cumate gene switch, includes a specific expression vector, pNEW, that contains a partial T 5 phage promoter combined with the Pseudomonas -based synthetic operator and the cymR repressor protein-encoding gene designed to express constitutively in the host strain. The induction of transcription relies on the addition of the exogenous inducer (cumate), which is nontoxic to the culture, water soluble, and inexpensive. The characteristics and potential of the expression system were determined. Using flow cytometry and fed-batch fermentations, we have shown that, with the newly developed cumate-regulated system, (i) higher recombinant product yields can be obtained than with the pET (isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactopyranoside [IPTG])-induced expression system, (ii) expression is tightly regulated, (iii) addition of cumate quickly results in a fully induced and homogenous protein-expressing population in contrast to the bimodal expression profile of an IPTG-induced population, (iv) expression can be modulated by varying the cumate concentration, and (v) the cumate-induced population remains induced and fully expressing even at 8 h following induction, resulting in high yields of the target protein Furthermore, the cumate gene switch described in this article is applicable to a wide range of E. coli strains.",

To discover more efficient and stable HNLs, we focused on the invasive cyanogenic millipede as a bioresource. The HNL identified from the millipede showed not only the highest specific activity toward benzaldehyde among known HNLs, including the almond HNL in industrial use, along with wide temperature and pH stabilities, but also high enantioselectivity in the synthesis of various cyanohydrins. These properties make it suitable as an industrial biocatalyst. Arthropods are likely to be valuable sources of potential biocatalysts for the next generation of industrial biotechnology.",

    "title": "Dynamics and constraints of enzyme evolution",
    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The wealth of distinct enzymatic functions found in nature is impressive and the on‐going evolutionary divergence of enzymatic functions continues to generate new and efficient catalysts, which can be seen through the recent emergence of enzymes able to degrade xenobiotics. However, recreating such processes in the laboratory has been met with only moderate success. What are the factors that lead to suboptimal research outputs? In this review, we discuss constraints on enzyme evolution, which can restrict evolutionary trajectories and lead to evolutionary dead‐ends. We highlight recent studies that have used experimental evolution to mimic different aspects of enzymatic adaptation under simple, controlled settings to shed light on evolutionary dynamics and constraints. A better understanding of these constraints will lead to the development of more efficient strategies for directed evolution and enzyme engineering. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev.

    "abstract": "Abstract Enzymatic deconstruction of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is under intense investigation, given the ability of hydrolase enzymes to depolymerize PET to its constituent monomers near the polymer glass transition temperature. To date, reported PET hydrolases have been sourced from a relatively narrow sequence space. Here, we identify additional PET-active biocatalysts from natural diversity by using bioinformatics and machine learning to mine 74 putative thermotolerant PET hydrolases. We successfully express, purify, and assay 51 enzymes from seven distinct phylogenetic groups; observing PET hydrolysis activity on amorphous PET film from 37 enzymes in reactions spanning pH from 4.5–9.0 and temperatures from 30–70 °C. We conduct PET hydrolysis time-course reactions with the best-performing enzymes, where we observe differences in substrate selectivity as function of PET morphology. We employed X-ray crystallography and AlphaFold to examine the enzyme architectures of all 74 candidates, revealing protein folds and accessory domains not previously associated with PET deconstruction. Overall, this study expands the number and diversity of thermotolerant scaffolds for enzymatic PET deconstruction.",

Herein, the efficient bromination of thymol was investigated, and turnover numbers of the enzyme were found to exceed 2 000 000. The major novelty of the work is that vanadium chloroperoxidase is more useful as a brominating enzyme than vanadium bromoperoxidase in terms of operational stability, besides being far more stable than heme‐containing peroxidases.",

The enzymes that catalyze these reactions are structurally distinct from ubiquitous terpene cyclases that, instead, assemble terpenes via intramolecular rearrangements of a single substrate. Herein, we report the structure and molecular details of a new family of prenyltransferases from marine algae that repurposes the terpene cyclase structural fold for the N -prenylation of glutamic acid during the biosynthesis of the potent neurochemicals domoic acid and kainic acid. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of the prenyltransferase found in domoic acid biosynthesis, DabA, and show distinct active site binding modifications that remodel the canonical magnesium (Mg 2+ )-binding motif found in terpene cyclases. We then applied our structural knowledge of DabA and a homologous enzyme from the kainic acid biosynthetic pathway, KabA, to reengineer their isoprene donor specificities (geranyl diphosphate [GPP] versus dimethylallyl diphosphate [DMAPP]) with a single amino acid change. While diatom DabA and seaweed KabA enzymes share a common evolutionary lineage, they are distinct from all other terpene cyclases, suggesting a very distant ancestor to the larger terpene synthase family.",

    "title": "Evaluation of deep eutectic solvents as co‐solvent for steroids 1‐en‐dehydrogenation biotransformation by <i>Arthrobacter simplex</i>",
    "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND As a low‐cost alternative to the traditional ionic liquids ( ILs ), deep eutectic solvents ( DESs ) have currently attracted increasing attention for their various applications including biocatalysis. This study aimed at analyzing the effect of DESs on Δ1, 2‐dehydrogeneration of cortisone acetate(CA) to prednisone acetate (PA) by Arthrobacter simplex . RESULTS Of the three DESs examined, ChCl :U was successfully employed as co‐solvent to improve the bioconversion efficiency. For substrate feeding concentration of 5 g L −1 , substrate conversion reached 93% by immobilized A. simplex cells (4 g DW L −1 ) with ChCl :U content of 6%, which is more efficient than conversions without DESs . Importantly, it has been shown that DESs and the immobilized cells can be easily recovered and then reused for five batches of bioconversion with a final conversion above 80%. CONCLUSION Our results show the potential use of DESs ‐based systems in industrial steroid biodehydrogenation by A. simplex , and provide an environmentally benign means of steroid biotransformation. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry",

    "title": "Identification of Novel Bacterial Members of the Imine Reductase Enzyme Family that Perform Reductive Amination",
    "abstract": "Abstract Reductive amination of carbonyl compounds constitutes one of the most efficient ways to rapidly construct chiral and achiral amine frameworks. Imine reductase (IRED) biocatalysts represent a versatile family of enzymes for amine synthesis through NADPH‐mediated imine reduction. The reductive aminases (RedAms) are a subfamily of IREDs that were recently shown to catalyze imine formation as well as imine reduction. Herein, a diverse library of novel enzymes were expressed and screened as cell‐free lysates for their ability to facilitate reductive amination to expand the known suite of biocatalysts for this transformation and to identify more enzymes with potential industrial applications. A range of ketones and amines were examined, and enzymes were identified that were capable of accepting benzylamine, pyrrolidine, ammonia, and aniline. Amine equivalents as low as 2.5 were employed to afford up to >99 % conversion, and for chiral products, up to >98 % ee could be achieved. Preparative‐scale reactions were conducted with low amine equivalents (1.5 or 2.0) of methylamine, allylamine, and pyrrolidine, achieving up to >99 % conversion and 76 % yield.",

    "title": "Estimating conformational heterogeneity of tryptophan synthase with a template‐based <scp>Alphafold2</scp> approach",
    "abstract": "Abstract The three‐dimensional structure of the enzymes provides very relevant information on the arrangement of the catalytic machinery and structural elements gating the active site pocket. The recent success of the neural network Alphafold2 in predicting the folded structure of proteins from the primary sequence with high levels of accuracy has revolutionized the protein design field. However, the application of Alphafold2 for understanding and engineering function directly from the obtained single static picture is not straightforward. Indeed, understanding enzymatic function requires the exploration of the ensemble of thermally accessible conformations that enzymes adopt in solution. In the present study, we evaluate the potential of Alphafold2 in assessing the effect of the mutations on the conformational landscape of the beta subunit of tryptophan synthase (TrpB). Specifically, we develop a template‐based Alphafold2 approach for estimating the conformational heterogeneity of several TrpB enzymes, which is needed for enhanced stand‐alone activity. Our results show the potential of Alphafold2, especially if combined with molecular dynamics simulations, for elucidating the changes induced by mutation in the conformational landscapes at a rather reduced computational cost, thus revealing its plausible application in computational enzyme design.",

Enzymes capable to perform this reaction are of great interest. The enzymes for stereoselective CC bond formations have been investigated very intensively during the last two decades.

On the other side new discoveries have brought more enzyme players in the arena of CC bond formation reactions. Novel enzymatic CC bond formation reactions have been applied, implying the most important benefit of biocatalysis, namely the high selectivity.",

    "title": "Improved Cyclopropanation Activity of Histidine‐Ligated Cytochrome P450 Enables the Enantioselective Formal Synthesis of Levomilnacipran",
    "abstract": "Abstract Engineering enzymes capable of modes of activation unprecedented in nature will increase the range of industrially important molecules that can be synthesized through biocatalysis. However, low activity for a new function is often a limitation in adopting enzymes for preparative‐scale synthesis, reaction with demanding substrates, or when a natural substrate is also present. By mutating the proximal ligand and other key active‐site residues of the cytochrome P450 enzyme from Bacillus megaterium (P450‐BM3), a highly active His‐ligated variant of P450‐BM3 that can be employed for the enantioselective synthesis of the levomilnacipran core was engineered. This enzyme, BM3‐Hstar, catalyzes the cyclopropanation of N , N ‐diethyl‐2‐phenylacrylamide with an estimated initial rate of over 1000 turnovers per minute and can be used under aerobic conditions. Cyclopropanation activity is highly dependent on the electronic properties of the P450 proximal ligand, which can be used to tune this non‐natural enzyme activity.",

    "title": "Optimizing human α-galactosidase for treatment of Fabry disease",
    "abstract": "Abstract Fabry disease is caused by a deficiency of α-galactosidase A (GLA) leading to the lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other glycosphingolipids. Fabry patients experience significant damage to the heart, kidney, and blood vessels that can be fatal. Here we apply directed evolution to generate more stable GLA variants as potential next generation treatments for Fabry disease. GLAv05 and GLAv09 were identified after screening more than 12,000 GLA variants through 8 rounds of directed evolution. Both GLAv05 and GLAv09 exhibit increased stability at both lysosomal and blood pH, stability to serum, and elevated enzyme activity in treated Fabry fibroblasts (19-fold) and GLA –/– podocytes (10-fold). GLAv05 and GLAv09 show improved pharmacokinetics in mouse and non-human primates. In a Fabry mouse model, the optimized variants showed prolonged half-lives in serum and relevant tissues, and a decrease of accumulated Gb3 in heart and kidney. To explore the possibility of diminishing the immunogenic potential of rhGLA, amino acid residues in sequences predicted to bind MHC II were targeted in late rounds of GLAv09 directed evolution. An MHC II-associated peptide proteomics assay confirmed a reduction in displayed peptides for GLAv09. Collectively, our findings highlight the promise of using directed evolution to generate enzyme variants for more effective treatment of lysosomal storage diseases.",
