  "_abstract": "Enantiomerically pure chiral amines are valuable synthetic intermediates, particularly for the preparation of pharmaceutical compounds. Traditionally, chiral amines have been obtained by resolution-based procedures, for example, by kinetic resolution of a racemate using an enzyme  [1, 2]  or crystallization of a diastereomer using a chiral acid to form a salt.  [3]  Increasingly, there is a desire to develop asymmetric approaches, or their equivalents, which can in principal deliver the product in 100 % yield and 100 % ee. For example, transaminases have been utilized for the conversion of COMMUNICATIONS"
