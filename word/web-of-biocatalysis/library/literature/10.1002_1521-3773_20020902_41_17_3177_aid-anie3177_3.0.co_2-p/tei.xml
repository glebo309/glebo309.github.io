This deracemization method involves the stereoinversion of one enantiomer to the other by repeated cycles of enzyme-catalyzed oxidation to the imine, followed by nonselective reduction back to the amino acid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> We demonstrated that both l-and d-a-amino acids can be prepared in this way by employing enantioselective d- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and l-amino acid oxidases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> respectively. A key factor that determines the efficiency of the deracemization process is the choice of reducing agent. In the early reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> sodium borohydride was employed, although the instability of this reagent at pH 7 precludes its use on a practical scale. However, this problem can be overcome by switching to alternative, stable reductants such as sodium cyanoborohydride, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> ammonium formate with Pd/C, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and also amine±borane complexes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Herein we report a significant new extension of the deracemization strategy by applying the method for the first time to the deracemization of chiral amines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> The key issue at the outset was the identification of enantioselective amine oxidases that would be suitable for the oxidation-reduction cycle. Amine oxidases have been classified into two groups, namely, Type I (Cu/TOPA-dependent) and Type II (flavin-dependent). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> In the catalytic cycle of the Type I enzyme the intermediate imine remains covalently bound to the protein and hence these enzymes were deemed unsuitable for our use. The Type II enzymes generate ™free∫ imines, and although they are well known from mammalian sources, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> their microbial counterparts are poorly documented; indeed at the outset of this work there were no reports of enantioselective transformations. Schilling and Lerch <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> reported the cloning and expression of a Type II monoamine oxidase from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N), and Sablin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> subsequently purified the enzyme to homogeneity and carried out substrate-specificity and kinetic studies. The enzyme was reported to have high activity towards simple aliphatic amines (for example, amylamine, butylamine) but was also active, albeit at a lower rate, towards benzylamine. We decided to select a-methylbenzylamine (AMBA, Scheme 1, R 1 ¼ Ph, R 2 ¼ Me) as a model system for study in view of its importance as a chiral amine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Our initial studies revealed that the A. niger MAO-N enzyme possessed very low, but measurable, activity towards l-a-methylbenzylamine and even slower oxidation of the d enantiomer (see below). We reasoned that such activity represented a viable starting point for improvement of both the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity using in vitro evolution methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> The MAO-N gene from A. niger was obtained from Schilling and Lerch <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and subcloned into the E. coli PET16b vector. Sequencing of the gene revealed four differences in the amino acid sequence compared to the published sequence (A300V, L304V, K348M, and R450G). Two of these differences (K348M and R450G) had previously been noted by Sablin et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> However, the activity of the enzyme (see below) was found to be comparable to published data and hence we used this plasmid as the starting point for the in vitro evolution experiments. The initial priority was the development of an effective high-throughput screen for amine oxidase activity and, in this respect, we focussed on a method that would allow approximately 2000±3000 colonies per plate to be visualized. Amine oxidases are typical of all members of the oxidase family in that they evolve hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. Many of the reported assays for oxidase activity are based upon capture of the peroxide by a peroxidase in the presence of a substrate that yields a highly colored product upon oxidation. Use of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the peroxidase substrate gave rise to a dark pink, insoluble product that gave both very high definition and contrast of the active colonies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p><p>The library of variants was generated by carrying out multiple cycles of mutagenesis using the E. coli XL1-Red mutator strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> followed by transformation of the plasmid library into E. coli BL21. The library was plated out directly onto nitrocellulose filters on agar plates (ca. 3000 colonies per plate) and, following partial lysis of the cells, each plate was treated with a cocktail containing both the assay mixture (lor d-AMBA, DAB) and also 2 % agarose. The plates were incubated at 37 8C after which they were inspected for positive clones. By using this colorometric assay we were able to identify clones that possessed higher activity towards l-AMBA than the d enantiomer (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p><p>COMMUNICATIONS 3178 ¹ 2002 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim 0044-8249/02/4117-3178 $ 20.00+.50/0 Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, No. 17  The result of screening a subset (ca. 150 000 clones) of the library led to the identification of 35 clones with improved activity towards l-AMBA compared to the wild-type enzyme. Each of these clones was grown on a small scale and assayed against both l-and d-AMBA as cell-free extracts, which resulted in the best 27 clones being selected for further study. Each of these 27 clones was assayed against amylamine, l-AMBA, and d-AMBA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>).</p><p>Examination of the polyacrylamide gels showed that several of these 27 clones appeared to be ™expression mutants∫, as evidenced by increased levels of protein expression. However two (identical) clones were clearly superior in terms of their selectivity and activity towards lversus d-AMBA and appeared not to have increased levels of expression of MAO-N. This clone was therefore selected for more detailed examination.</p><p>Both the wild-type and mutant MAO-N were purified by a modification of the literature procedure to give protein of approximately 10 % purity. Each enzyme was then assayed against l-AMBA, d-AMBA, benzylamine, and amylamine as the substrate (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>The data revealed that the activity of the mutant towards l-AMBA (k cat ¼ 8.0 min À1 ) was 47-fold higher than the wildtype enzyme (k cat ¼ 0.17 min À1 ). Moreover, the selectivity of the mutant for the l enantiomer versus d-AMBA (ca. 100:1) had also increased (5.8-fold) relative to the wild-type enzyme (ca. 17:1). Thus, the outcome of the in vitro evolution experiments had been to simultaneously improve both the enantioselectivity and catalytic activity of the enzyme. For comparison, the activity towards the best substrate for the wild-type enzyme, namely amylamine, and also benzylamine, is presented. Sequencing of the mutant revealed a single change in the amino acid sequence (Asn336Ser).</p><p>The substantial improvement in activity and selectivity of the mutant was confirmed by chiral HPLC (Chiralcel CrownPak CR þ ) in which complete oxidation of the l enantiomer was apparent after 24 h, whereas there was no detectable conversion of the d enantiomer. The final objective became the application of the mutant enzyme to the deracemization of dl-AMBA. A range of reducing agents was screened (sodium borohydride, catalytic transfer hydrogenation, amine±borane complexes) using 1 mm dl-AMBA as the substrate in the presence of the mutant MAO-N. This screen identified the ammonia±borane complex as the optimal reagent which gave a 77 % yield of d-AMBA with an ee value of 93 %. Greater optical purities of the product (up to 99 % ee) could be achieved although at the expense of yield. We also carried out the stereoinversion of l-to d-AMBA (18 % yield, 99 % ee) and showed that under identical conditions there was no conversion of d-into l-AMBA.</p><p>In conclusion we have successfully achieved the ™directed evolution∫ of an enzyme to meet the specific requirements of a novel biotransformation. The decision to select the A. niger MAO-N gene for in vitro evolution was based upon the observation that the wild-type MAO-N enzyme showed inherent selectivity for l-over d-AMBA (ca. 17:1), although the overall rate was very low. An interesting aspect of the present work is the identification of a mutant with enhanced enantioselectivity by using a single enantiomer substrate in the screen (l-AMBA). There is currently much effort directed towards the development of truly enantioselective screens in which racemates are used, thereby mimicking the real-life situation found in a kinetic resolution in which the two enantiomers compete for the enzyme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> It may be that if one is able to screen large enough libraries of variant genes (ca. 10 6 ), by using inherently simpler screens, then enzymes with improved enantioselectivity can be identified in the manner described here.

Fabrication of Carbohydrate Chips for Studying Protein±Carbohydrate Interactions** Sungjin Park and Injae Shin*</p><p>Carbohydrates play a central role in living organisms as recognition markers to enable cell adhesion, fertilization, differentiation, development, and tumor-cell metastasis through carbohydrate±protein interactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Interestingly, it is through these biomolecular interactions that bacteria and viruses adhere to the host cells and confer pathogenic properties. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Therefore, it is important to determine the molecular basis for specific protein±carbohydrate recognition events. Details of carbohydrate±protein interactions have been investigated mainly by biophysical and biochemical approaches, including X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopic studies of carbohydrate±protein complexes, mutagenesis, and synthesis of nonnatural sugar analogues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> Despite the established approaches to investigate carbohy-drate±protein interactions, high-throughput methods have not been developed.</p><p>In the last decade, biological microchips (biochips) have been fabricated for a variety of applications. For instance, DNA chips (gene chips) are extensively used for tracking the activity of many genes at once and for studying changes in gene expression in diseased states. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Additionally, protein chips have been exploited for the high-throughput study of molecular interactions and biochemical activities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref> and profiling protein expression in normal and diseased states. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Ziauddin and Sabatini have developed cell microarrays for the functional analysis of gene products in parallel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> Analogously, carbohydrate-based arrays may provide a new tool for the high-throughput study of carbohydrate±protein interactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> In many cases, carbohydrate-binding proteins recognize terminal and/or penultimate saccharides. Furthermore, they exhibit a strong affinity for multivalent carbohydrates with suitable spacing and orientation (cluster effect) but bind to monovalent oligosaccharides weakly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Thus, we reasoned that carbohydrate chips that contain immobilized mono-and disaccharides with suitable distances between the carbohydrate probes on the glass surface could provide a useful tool for elucidating recognition events between carbohydrates and proteins at a molecular level.</p><p>An efficient immobilization technique of carbohydrates on the surface is essential for successful fabrication of carbohydrate chips. Recently, we prepared glycopeptides/glycoproteins by chemoselective ligation of maleimide-linked sugars to cysteine-possessing peptides/proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> Herein we report how this method was applied to immobilize carbohydrates on glass microscope slides (7.5 cm î 2.5 cm). As shown in Scheme 1, maleimide-linked sugars are attached through stable thioether linkages to the slide coated with thiol groups.</p><p>Carbohydrates were appended to linkers Ln of various lengths (L1, L2, L3, and L4) by coupling glycosylamines obtained from one-pot amination of carbohydrates to bifunctional cross-linkers such as 1 (Schemes 2 and 3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Furthermore, we also prepared L2-NH 2 and L4-NH 2 , which lack the carbohydrate moiety, to examine the nonspecific binding of lectins to linkers (Scheme 2). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>2 ( 2 ( 2 (</head><label>222</label><figDesc>and an anionic form, [Ag 3 L * MeðSÞ NO 3 ) 4 (CH 3 CN) 2 ] À .
