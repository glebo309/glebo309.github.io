Lipases are frequently used in such reactions because phospholipids are generally included within their substrate range, and they are commercially available from a wide range of organisms. In selecting an enzyme to catalyze a reaction, it is important to choose one with a good level of reactivity for the target substrate. Although lipases from many sources have appeared in the literature on phospholipid modification research, including those from Mucor miehei (Lipozyme) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>, M. javan-icus <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, Candida cylindracea (rugosa ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, C. antartica <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>, Candida sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, Humicola lanuginosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, Rhizopus delemar <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>, R. niveus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, R. javanicus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, R. arrhizus <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>, Rhizopus sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, Penicillium cyclopium <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>, Aspergillus niger <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, Pseudomonas sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>, potato tubers <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, porcine pancreas <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>, and calf pregastric <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, the reaction conditions used in these studies have varied widely, making it difficult to compare the various lipases in terms of their reactivities for phospholipids. We therefore attempted in the present work to compare a broad range of commercially available lipase preparations under identical reaction conditions. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in a reverse micellar system with sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) was chosen as the reaction for evaluating the reactivities of the lipases, our reasoning being that, because enzymes added to this system would be dissolved in the reverse micelles and adsorb onto the hydrophobic interface, they would be fully activated by what is known as "interfacial activation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, unlike in microaqueous organic media in which transesterification occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>.</p><p>The performances of nineteen commercial lipases in hydrolyzing PC in this reverse micellar system are compared with respect to their source organism and positional specificity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials.</head><p>Lipases from R. delemar (6000 U/mg) and C. cylindracea (10,000 U/mg) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Lipozyme 10.000L (10 U/mg), SP388 (20 U/mg), SP398 (50 U/mg), SP523 (4000 U/mg), SP524 (2500 U/mg), SP525 (150 U/mg), SP526 (25 U/mg), Paratase A (0.75 U/mg), Paratase M (1 U/mg), and the immobilized lipases Lipozyme IM20 [25 Batch Interesterification Units (BIU)/g] and SP435 (7 U/mg) were generous gifts from Novo Nordisk (Bagsvaerd, Denmark). Lipase A6 (60 U/mg), Lipase AY30 (30 U/mg), Lipase F (150 U/mg), Lipase M10 (10 U/mg), Newlase F (30 U/mg), and Pancreatin F (0.75 U/mg) were kindly supplied by Amano Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Nagoya, Japan). The source organisms of all these lipases are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. Phospholipase C (PLC) (Type III, from Bacillus cereus), which was used to determine the positional specificity of the above lipases for PC, was obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC), used as the substrate, was purchased from Asahi Chemical Industry (Osaka, Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were obtained from commercial sources.</p><p>Hydrolysis reaction and analysis. A reaction mixture consisting of 5 mL isooctane, containing PC (50 mg, 65 µmol) and AOT (50 mg), 1 mL buffer (0.1 M borate-HCl with 1 mM CaCl 2 , pH 7.5), and 250 U lipase, unless otherwise stated, was stirred magnetically in sealed screw-capped tubes at 30°C. Periodically, 100-µL aliquots were withdrawn and mixed with 100 µL CHCl 3 /MeOH (2:1, vol/vol) and 100 µL H 2 O. After centrifugation, the organic layer was applied onto a silica gel rod (SIII; Iatron Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) and developed by CHCl 3 /MeOH/H 2 O (20:10:1, vol/vol/vol). The amounts of PC and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in the hydrolysates were determined by an Iatroscan TH-10 TLC analyzer, equipped with an SIC chromatorecorder II (Iatron Laboratories) by using the relationship between the peak area ratio and the molar ratio, obtained in advance. The degree of PC hydrolysis was calculated according to Equation 1: degree of hydrolysis (%) = LPC/(LPC + remaining PC) × 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Determination of positional specificity. To investigate the positional specificities of the lipases for PC, the LPC produced was hydrolyzed to monoglycerides (MG) with PLC as follows (1-MG and 2-MG are formed from 1-LPC and 2-LPC, respectively). After the hydrolysis reaction, 1 mL of the reaction mixture was added to 2 mL CHCl 3 /MeOH (2:1, vol/vol) to stop the reaction, and the solvent was then removed by evaporation. The residue was dissolved into 1 mL diethyl ether, and dispersed in 200 µL of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) that contained 10 mM CaCl 2 , followed by incubation with 2.5 U PLC at 30°C until the LPC was completely hydrolyzed. The upper layer was then developed by CHCl 3 /acetone (9:1, vol/vol) on an HBO 3 -coated silica gel rod capable of separating MG isomers. The resulting MG isomers were qualitatively identified from their respective R f values with the same analytical devices described in the Hydrolysis reaction and analysis section.</p><p>To confirm the positional specificity of one of the lipases, Pancreatin F, against triglycerides, we also carried out the hydrolysis reaction with olive oil, and identified the structural isomers of the hydrolyzed products (diglycerides and MG). The reaction procedure was the same as that described for the hydrolysis of PC, expect that olive oil was used in place of PC. After allowing the reaction to proceed for over 4 h, the organic layer was directly analyzed on an HBO 3 -coated silica gel rod in a similar manner to that described above.</p></div>

The positional specificities of these lipases for PC, obtained in this work, are also shown. The commercially available lipases tested could be classified into three groups. The first group (type 1), Lipozyme IM 20, Lipase M10, and Pancreatin F, had high hydrolysis activity for PC, hydrolyzing it completely within 24 h. Of the three type-1 lipases, that obtained from M. javanicus (Lipase M10) was the most active, the PC being completely hydrolyzed after only 1.5-h reaction. Lipozyme IM20 and Lipase M10 showed sn-1 positional specificity for PC, which is the same as that for triglycerides. Pancreatin F, however, attacked the sn-2 position of PC, which is different from its specificity for triglycerides. Pancreatin F is derived from hog pancreas, in which another lipolytic enzyme, phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ), capable of attacking the sn-2 position of phospholipids, is known to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. It is thus thought that Pancreatin F may consist of a mixture of lipases and PLA 2 . To verify this, Pancreatin F was employed in a hydrolysis reaction with olive oil. In this situation, the enzyme exhibited 1, 3-positional specificity for olive oil, indicating that it is obviously a mixture of the two enzymes, and that the PLA 2 in Pancreatin F dominantly hydrolyze PC because of their superiority over lipases in PC hydrolysis.</p><p>The second group (type 2), consisting of SP388, SP524, Lipozyme 10.000L, Lipase F, Newlase F and Lipase from R. delemar, showed moderate activity in PC hydrolysis; the degree of hydrolysis increased gradually with reaction time, but complete hydrolysis was not attained during 48-h reaction. To determine whether the hydrolysis reactions of these lipases ceased while incomplete or whether it was only that the reaction rates were slower than those of the type-1 lipases, similar hydrolysis reactions were performed with an increased amount of enzyme from 250 to 1000 U (for SP388, SP524, Lipozyme 10.000L, and Lipase F) or 2000 U (for Newlase F, and Lipase from R. delemar). As a result, all type-2 lipases completely hydrolyzed PC, suggesting that type-1 and type-2 lipases differ only in their reaction rates. The positional specificities of all type-2 lipases for PC were the same as those for triglycerides.</p><p>Lipases of the third group (type 3), which consisted of SP398, SP435, SP523, SP525, SP526, Paratase A, Paratase M, Lipase A6, Lipase AY30, and Lipase from C. cylindracea, showed little or no hydrolysis of PC, and almost no improvement was realized when the amount of enzyme added was increased in the same way as for the type-2 lipases.</p><p>The lipases belonging to type 1 are from Mucor species, while those of type 2 are from Mucor or Rhizopus sp. Lipases derived from Aspergillus and Humicola sp. (type 3) had little PC hydrolysis activity, in spite of being derived from fungi and/or showing 1,3-positional specificity for triglycerides like the lipases of type 1 and 2. It is also interesting that all positionally nonspecific lipases, derived from Candida sp. as tested in this study, were of type 3 and showed almost no PC hydrolysis activity. These results suggest that lipases from Mucor or Rhizopus sp. should preferably be selected for use in the enzymatic conversion of phospholipids.</p><p>Svensson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> compared the reactivities of commer-cial lipases toward phospholipids in a transesterification reaction, paying special attention to their source organisms, and found a tendency similar to that observed in the present study. However, several other researchers have reported appreciable activities for lipases from Candida sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, A. niger <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> or Humicola sp. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> in the hydrolysis or transesterification of phospholipids. The discrepancy between their results and ours is probably due to differences in the reaction conditions employed [i.e., hydrolysis or transesterification reaction with limited water <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>] and enzyme purity [for instance, A. niger seems to have the potential to produce PLA 1 or PLA 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>], and/or modification of lipases by polyethylene glycol <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</p><p>Although not all lipase preparations that are commercially available worldwide were examined in this work, we believe that the results presented here provide information that will be useful in selecting lipases suitable for use in the enzymatic conversion of phospholipids.</p></div>		</body>
