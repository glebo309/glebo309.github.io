			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Directed evolution technologies were used to selectively improve the stability of an enzyme without compromising its catalytic activity. In particular, this article describes the tandem use of two evolution strategies to evolve a xylanase, rendering it tolerant to temperatures in excess of 90°C. A library of all possible 19 amino acid substitutions at each residue position was generated and screened for activity after a temperature challenge. Nine single amino acid residue changes were identified that enhanced thermostability. All 512 possible combinatorial variants of the nine mutations were then generated and screened for improved thermal tolerance under stringent conditions. The screen yielded eleven variants with substantially improved thermal tolerance. Denaturation temperature transition midpoints were increased from 61°C to as high as 96°C. The use of two evolution strategies in combination enabled the rapid discovery of the enzyme variant with the highest degree of fitness (greater thermal tolerance and activity relative to the wild-type parent).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Naturally thermostable proteins have been studied extensively to gain insight into the adaptive mechanisms for achieving thermostability and to decipher the general rules that could be applied to stabilizing other mesophilic proteins. Enzyme sequences from mesophilic organisms have been compared to their homologs from thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms in efforts to identify the interactions responsible for conferring enhanced thermostability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adams 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ladenstein and Antranikian 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Britton et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kinjo and Nishikawa 2001)</ref>. Numerous mutagenesis studies have also explored this phenomenon; however, the mechanisms that mediate protein thermostabilization are still poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams and Kelly 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Farinas et al. 2001)</ref>. Considerable amino acid sequence differences between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins greatly complicate attempts to identify specific substitutions that affect thermostability. Moreover, large changes in thermostability are usually the result of cumulative small contributions of a number of mutations (van den <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Burg et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gray et al. 2001)</ref>. Rules for engineering substantial protein stability by rational design are likely to be protein specific, and any such design effort in combination with structural information is currently beyond state of the art approaches.</p><p>A more facile, nonrational approach to improving the thermal properties of an enzyme is directed evolution. We have used Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis (GSSM) technology <ref type="bibr">(Short 2001b</ref>) in combination with GeneReassembly technology <ref type="bibr">(Short 2003)</ref> to evolve thermostability characteristics into an enzyme. The GSSM method is a highly efficient mutagenesis technique that can be used to random-ize successive codons in a gene, systematically generating a library of enzyme variants representing all possible 19 amino acid substitutions at each residue position. It is most powerful when used in combination with GeneReassembly technology to randomly combine single beneficial amino acid substitutions, allowing the identification of protein variants with optimal fitness, in this case, increased thermostability, while preserving optimal catalytic activity.</p><p>For this enzyme evolution study, we have chosen to optimize the thermostability of a xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) because of the many potential commercial applications of a stable enzyme for hydrolysis of plant-derived xylans. Xylanases catalyze the endo-cleavage of ␤1,4 bonds in xylan polymers, and have utility in improving the effectiveness and economics of processing lignocellulosic materials for the generation of liquid fuels and chemicals. Xylanases can act as substitutes for chlorine chemicals in pulp bleaching, and, when stable and active at high temperature, are useful in food production, biomass conversion, dough making, brewing, and as stable animal feed supplements <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Saul et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kulkarni et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clarke et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beg et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Irwin et al. 2003)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evolution by the GSSM method</head><p>The xylanase used for this work (XYL7746, internal nomenclature) was discovered from a complex environmental DNA library <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Robertson et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Short 1997</ref><ref type="bibr">Short , 1999</ref><ref type="bibr">Short , 2001a) )</ref> derived from a sample of fresh bovine manure. XYL7746 is a 20-kD protein belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 11 <ref type="bibr">(Coutinho and Henrissat 1999a,b)</ref>. The mature xylanase shares 83% sequence identity with the family 11 xylanase from Bacillus circulans (GenBank accession AAM08360). A number of commercial xylanases belong to family 11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kulkarni et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beg et al. 2001)</ref>, and as such, we were interested in exploring the possibility of improving the thermal properties of a family 11 xylanase.</p><p>The GSSM method <ref type="bibr">(Short 2001b</ref>) was used to create a comprehensive library of point mutations in gene XYL7746. A screen for thermotolerance was developed that measures residual xylanase activity following a temperature challenge above the melting point of the wild-type enzyme. This xylanase thermotolerance screen identified nine single-site amino acid mutants (D8F, Q11H, N12L, G17I, G60H, P64V, S65V, G68A, and S79P; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) that had improved thermal tolerance relative to the wild-type enzyme (as measured following a heat challenge at 80°C for 20 min; see Materials and Methods). Wild-type enzyme and all nine single-site amino acid mutants were produced in Escherichia coli and purified utilizing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. There was no noticeable difference in activity due to the tag (data not shown).</p><p>To determine the effect of the single amino acid mutations on enzymatic activity, all nine mutants were purified and their xylanase activity (initial rates at the wild-type temperature optimum, 70°C) was compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Enzyme activities were comparable to wild type (initial rate normalized to 1.0) for D8F, N12L, G17I, G60H, P64V, S65V, G68A, and S79P mutants (relative initial rates 0.65, 0.68, 0.76, 1.1, 1.0, 1.2, 0.98, and 0.84, respectively) confirming that these mutations do not significantly alter the enzymatic activity. (Initial rates were measured three or more times, and variance was typically less than 10%.) In contrast to these eight mutants, a notable reduction in enzymatic activity was observed for the best thermal tolerant, single-site mutant, Q11H (relative initial rate 0.35).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Melting temperature (T m ) of wild-type and single-site amino acid mutant enzymes</head><p>The purified wild-type xylanase and the nine thermal tolerant single-site amino acid mutants were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Aggregation was apparent for the wild-type enzyme as evidenced by a shoulder in the DSC trace for its thermal denaturation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). The evolved mutant enzymes showed no indication of aggregation. For all enzymes, thermally induced denaturation was irreversible and no discernible transition was observed in a second scan of the sample. Due to the irreversibility of denaturation, only the apparent T m (melting temperature) could be calculated <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sanchez-Ruiz 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Beldarrain et al. 2000)</ref>. The T m of the wild-type enzyme was 61°C, while the T m s of all point mutants were increased and ranged from 64°C to 70°C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The Q11H mutation introduced the largest increase (T m ‫ס‬ 70°C) over wild-type followed by P64V (69°C), G17I (67°C), and D8F (67°C).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9X combined GSSM mutant enzyme</head><p>The 9X enzyme was constructed by combining the single-site changes of the nine thermal tolerant up-mutants by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The 9X mutant was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. DSC was performed to determine the melting temperature. The T m of 9X enzyme was 35 degrees higher than the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating a dramatic shift in its thermal stability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the combined mutations and elevated melting temperature on the enzyme's biochemical properties, pH and temperature profiles were constructed and compared to the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type and 9X mutant enzyme had comparable pH/activity profiles with the highest activity between pH 5 and 6 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Both enzymes had similar initial rate/temperature optima at 70°C; however, the wild-type enzyme had higher activity at lower temperatures (25°C-50°C), whereas the 9X mutant retained more than 60% of its activity up to 100°C (determined by initial rate) in the presence of substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The activity of the wild-type enzyme was not detectable at temperatures above 70°C.</p><p>To determine the effect of the nine combined mutations on enzyme thermal tolerance, residual activity was measured and compared to the wild-type enzyme. Residual activity was determined by a heat challenge for 5 min at each temperature (37°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C, 80°C, and 90°C) followed by activity measurements at 37°C. The wild-type enzyme was completely inactivated above 70°C, while the evolved 9X mutant displayed significant activity after heating at 70°C, 80°C, and even 90°C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Furthermore, although the activity of the wild-type enzyme decreased with increasing temperature, the 9X variant was somewhat activated by heating at temperatures up to 60°C.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of combinatorial GSSM variants using GeneReassembly technology</head><p>To identify combinatorial variants of the nine single site amino acid mutants with highest thermal tolerance and activity compared to the additively constructed 9X variant, a GeneReassembly library <ref type="bibr">(Short 2003</ref>) of all possible mutant combinations (2 9 ) was constructed and screened. Using thermal tolerance as the screening criterion, 33 unique combinations of the nine mutations were identified including the original 9X variant. A secondary screen was performed to select for variants with higher activity/expression than the evolved 9X. This screen yielded 10 variants with sequences possessing between 6 and 8 of the original single mutations in various combinations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>).</p><p>The melting temperature (T m ) of each of the combinatorial variants was at least 28°C higher than the wild type (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) and all of the reassembly variants displayed higher relative activity than the 9X enzyme (data not shown). The activity of one variant in particular, 6X-2, was greater than the wild-type enzyme and significantly better (1.7-fold) than the 9X enzyme (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). Sequence comparison of the reassembly variants identified at least six mutations that were required for the enhanced thermostability (&gt;20 degrees). All 33 unique variants found in the initial thermostability screen contained both Q11H and G17I mutations, demonstrating their importance for thermal tolerance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of wild-type and variant polysaccharide product fingerprints</head><p>The products generated by the wild-type, 6X-2, and 9X variants were compared by polysaccharide analysis using carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (PACE). Different substrates (oligosaccharides and polysaccharides) were tested for hydrolysis by the xylanases. The digestion products of the three xylanases tested were very similar (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). All three enzymes hydrolyzed (Xyl) 6 and (Xyl) 5 , mainly into both (Xyl) 3 and (Xyl) 2 , and (Xyl) 4 was hydrolyzed to (Xyl) 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). Only a small amount of hydrolysis of (Xyl) 3 into (Xyl) 2 and Xyl was observed, indicating that (Xyl) 3 is a relatively poor substrate for the enzyme. No activity was detected on (Xyl) 2 (data not shown). Beechwood xylan, which contains glucuronosyl residues, was hydrolyzed by all three enzymes mainly into (Xyl) 2 and (Xyl) 3 , but other bands were detected that migrated between oligoxylan bands (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). In PACE analysis, each oligosaccharide has a specific migration, depending on the sugar composition and degree of polymerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goubet et al. 2002)</ref>; thus, these bands likely correspond to oligoglucuronoxylans. Therefore, the evolved enzymes retained the substrate specificity of the wild-type enzyme.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>A combination of laboratory gene evolution strategies was used to rapidly generate a highly active and thermostable xylanase optimized for process compatibility in a number of industrial market applications. GSSM methodology was employed to scan the entire sequence of a xylanase (XYL7746) and to identify nine point mutations that improve its thermal tolerance.</p><p>Although it had no discernable effect on the hydrolysis product profile of the enzyme (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), the addition of the nine mutations to the protein sequence resulted in a moderate reduction in enzymatic specific activity at the wild-type temperature optimum (70°C; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). Using the GeneReassembly method to generate a combinatorial library of the nine single-site amino acid mutants, this reduction in activity was overcome. Ten thermostable variants (T m s between 89°C and 94°C) with activity better than the 9X variant were obtained from screening the GeneReassembly (C) Thermal stability of wild-type and evolved 9X mutant enzymes. Thermal dependence of activity of the wild-type and evolved 9X mutant enzymes was measured by first heating the enzymes at each of the indicated temperatures for 5 min followed by cooling to room temperature and the measurement of residual activity (initial rate at 37°C [pH 6.0]). For all experiments initial rates were measured two or more times, and the variation was less than 10%. For comparison, the data are shown normalized at the wild-type maximum for each condition.</p><p>library. With a T m of 90°C, enzymatic specific activity surpassing the wild type and a product fingerprint unaltered and comparable to the wild type, the 6X-2 variant is particularly notable. To our knowledge the shift in T m obtained for these variants is the highest increase reported from the application of directed evolution technologies or by rational design.</p><p>To gauge the effectiveness of combinatorial mixing versus addition of the point mutants to the desired phenotype, a fitness parameter combining contributions both from changes in enzyme activity and thermal stability was calculated for each mutant. The term fitness as described here is not an objective measure that can be compared to other enzymes, but rather a term that allows the measurement of the success of directed evolution of this particular xylanase. Because enzyme fitness, F, is calculated by equally weighting changes in T m and enzyme activity (equation 1) for this set of variants, the maximum allowable fitness value is 2 (F T Յ 1 and F V Յ 1, see equations 2 and 3 in Materials and Methods). In other words, if the variant with the best activity also had the highest T m , its fitness value would be 2. Considering only thermal stability, it is clear that Q11H is the best single site mutation and the 9X variant is the most thermostable combinatorial variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). However, with a fitness value near 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>), the 6X-2 variant is the closest to possessing the best possible combination of thermal stability and enzyme activity. The single site mutation that confers the highest value of fitness is S65V. Although the T m of the S65V mutant is lower than that of the Q11H mutant (66°C versus 70°C, respectively), it has a higher fitness value because its specific activity is not reduced relative to the wild type.</p><p>The GeneReassembly method also allowed the identification of key residues for improved thermal stability. Two mutations, Q11H and G17I, were present in every GeneReassembly variant identified based on thermal tolerance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). The structural determinants for thermal stability of proteins have been studied and several theories have been documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Britton et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chan et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Yip et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tanner et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ladenstein and Antranikian 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vetriani et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Britton et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kinjo and Nishikawa 2001)</ref>. Hydrogen bonding patterns, ionic interactions, decreased length of surface loops, and hydrophobic packing are among the key factors contributing to protein thermal stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pace et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams and Kelly 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kumar and Nussinov 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Voigt et al. 2001)</ref>. Even though the contribution of each type of interaction to protein thermal stability is not fully understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams and Kelly 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kumar et al. 2000)</ref>, many studies have suggested that hydrophobic interactions are perhaps the most significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al. 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Britton et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Spassov et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Witarto and Sode 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Machius et al. 2003)</ref>. Other studies, however, argue that electrostatic interactions and favorable hydrogen bonding patterns contribute as much or more to stability than do hydrophobic interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Voorhorst et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wallon et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gruber et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pace 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pace et al. 2001)</ref>. Our findings corroborate the premise that hydrophobic interactions are key, as all but two of the stabilizing mutations found in this study are replacements of relatively polar, charged or small (glycine) residues for much larger nonpolar residues. It must be noted, however, that the single site mutation that introduces the largest increase in T m is Q11H. The aromatic nature of the histidine residue could enable hydrophobic contact, but, in addition to the introduction of a favorable hydrogen bond, the histidine residue could also introduce an electrostatic interaction if protonated.</p><p>The structure of the B. circulans xylanase <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wakarchuk et al. 1994</ref>) (PDB ID 1BCX) consists of two ␤-sheets, where one sheet forms the protein surface and the other lies beneath and forms the active site. A ␤-strand at the immediate N terminus of the protein lies on the edge of the active site ␤-sheet. As such, unwinding the structure beginning from the N terminus would initiate the disassembly of the active site. Interestingly, the first four mutations in the sequence that were discovered in this study (D8F, Q11H, N12L, and G17I) are clustered together at the N terminus. Assuming that the structure of XYL7746 and that of the B. circulans enzyme are very similar (XYL7746 shares 83% sequence identity with the B. circulans xylanase), these mutations seem to help anchor the N-terminal ␤-strand to the activesite ␤-sheet, making the structure more thermally stable. Another set of four mutations also clusters together in the N-terminal region (G60H, P65V, S65V, and G68A). With the exception of the histidine substitution at position 60, the mutations all introduce hydrophobic side chains and likely stabilize packing through the hydrophobic effect.</p><p>The contribution of the ninth mutation, S79P, to improved thermal stability is not as clear. It is interesting, however, that the B. circulans xylanase has a proline at the  corresponding position (P 76 in the B. circulans enzyme). In the primary sequence, this proline is only two residues away from the active site nucleophile, E 78 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Wakarchuk et al. 1994</ref>). In the crystal structure, P 76 lies on a turn between two ␤-strands that form part of the active site, and it may be that the proline at this position helps orient other residues in the ␤-sheet into conformations that strengthen stabilizing interactions. The T m s determined by DSC of the B. circulans xylanase and xylanase XYL7746 are very close (∼60°C versus 61°C, respectively, at comparable scan rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Davoodi et al. 1998)</ref>). However, in the sequence context of XYL7746, a proline at position 79 increases the T m to 64°C (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). It may be that the proline also has a stabilizing effect in the B. circulans xylanase, and that a P76S mutation in this enzyme would decrease the T m of the enzyme.</p><p>Even with a good understanding of the optimal interactions to enhance thermal tolerance, the prediction of where to make mutations that introduce such interactions is not straightforward. A nonrational approach using the GSSM method, however, allows rapid sampling of all side chains at all positions within a protein structure. Unlike rational design, or evolution methods that randomize preselected sites, the GSSM method leads to the discovery of amino acid substitutions that introduce functional interactions that could not have been foreseen. The tandem use of GSSM and GeneReassembly technologies is particularly effective, as it capitalizes on the attributes of both methods, enabling the selection of the fittest variant from a combinatorial library of improved enzymes. GeneReassembly technology recombines any number of mutations anywhere in the target gene with the same (high) efficiency in contrast to PCRbased molecular evolution methods where the efficiency drops significantly with decreasing distance between mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Volkov and Arnold 2000)</ref>. In addition, GC-content or secondary structures do not affect the diversity in the resulting chimeric library. The library size can easily be calculated from the number of mutations included. The method is not biased towards any particular crossover, and the resulting pool of gene chimeras contains all possible combinations in equal amounts, reducing screening efforts to a minimum.</p><p>The knowledge obtained from directed evolution approaches, combined with structural information, may one day enable the effective prediction of mutations that introduce desirable functional interactions in proteins.</p></div>
