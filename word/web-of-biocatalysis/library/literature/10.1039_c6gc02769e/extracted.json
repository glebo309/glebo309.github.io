  "_title": "A metagenomics approach for new biocatalyst discovery: application to transaminases and the synthesis of allylic amines",
  "_abstract": "Transaminase enzymes have significant potential for the sustainable synthesis of amines using mild aqueous reaction conditions. Here a metagenomics mining strategy has been used for new transaminase enzyme discovery. Starting from oral cavity microbiome samples, DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed. Subsequent in silico mining of a library of contiguous reads built from the sequencing data identified 11 putative Class III transaminases which were cloned and overexpressed. Several screening protocols were used and three enzymes selected of interest due to activities towards substrates covering a wide structural diversity. Transamination of functionalized cinnamaldehydes was then investigated for the production of valuable amine building blocks. † Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See"
