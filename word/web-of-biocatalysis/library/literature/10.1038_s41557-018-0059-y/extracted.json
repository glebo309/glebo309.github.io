  "_abstract": "Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents for chemical reactions were obtained from commercial suppliers and used as received (Sigma-Aldrich and VWR). GDH-105 and KRED-P2-D03 were purchased from Codexis as cell free lysates and used as received. Silica gel chromatography purifications were carried out using AMD Silica Gel 60. 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker UltraShield Plus (500 and 125 MHz, respectively) instrument, and are internally referenced to residual proton signals in CDCl 3 (7.26 ppm). Data for 1 H-NMR are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ ppm), multiplicity (s = singlet, brs = broad singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublet, dt = doublet of triplet, ddd = doublet of doublet of doublet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. Data for 13 C NMR are reported in terms of chemical shift relative to CDCl 3 (77 ppm). High-resolution mass spectra were obtained on an Agilent 6220 LC/MS with an electrospray"
