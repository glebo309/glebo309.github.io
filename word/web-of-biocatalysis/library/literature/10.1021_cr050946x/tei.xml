<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Ionic liquids 1 are substances that are completely composed of ions and are liquid at or close to room temperature. Interest in these compounds, often heralded as the green, high-tech media of the future, 2 is still increasing rapidly <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and stems from their near-zero vapor pressure, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> their thermal stability, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and their widely tunable properties as regards polarity, hydrophobicity, and solvent miscibility behavior through appropriate modification of the cation and the anion. Mainly on account of their unconventional miscibility behavior, ionic liquids show an increasing potential to revolutionize reaction technology. Their synthesis, physicochemical properties, and major fields of application have been reviewed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">6</ref> and the number of applications of ionic liquids as reaction media for organic synthesis and catalysis is growing rapidly. Many types of ionic liquids are now commercially available in high purity. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Biocatalysis in ionic liquids media was first reported in 2000. <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[10]</ref> The early work involved ionic liquids composed of a 1,3-dialkylimidazolium or N-alkylpyridinium cation and a weakly coordinating anion (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Tables <ref type="table">1</ref><ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>). These still play a major role, but the attention is slowly shifting toward new structural types. A number of brief overviews of the literature on biocatalysis in ionic liquids have appeared, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[13]</ref> to keep readers abreast of the rapidly expanding subject. These tend to focus on the recent highlights, usually complemented with a tabular overview. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">13</ref> Yang and Pan have published a more extensive review that covers many aspects of the subject (solvent properties, including purity issues, enzyme activity, stability and selectivity). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">14</ref> A review by Moon et al. is focused on biocatalytic transformations in ionic liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">15</ref> The background to the interest in biocatalysis in ionic liquids is a desire to replace volatile organic solvents by nonvolatile ionic liquids. Organic solvents are widely used with enzymes, although these function admirably in water, their natural medium, to improve the solubility of hydrophobic reactants and/or products and to shift reaction equilibria from hydrolysis toward synthesis. Moreover, the unconventional solvent properties of ionic liquids have already given rise to new and highly efficient reaction methodologies.</p><p>Here we will review the various issues that surround biocatalysis in ionic liquids. The effects of ionic liquids on the structure and activity of enzymes as well as on their thermal and operational stability will be surveyed. Furthermore, the effects of ionic liquids on the (enantio)selectivity of biocatalytic transformations in comparison with conventional reaction media and the design of efficient reaction procedures based on the unconventional solvent characteristics of ionic liquids will be reviewed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Purity</head><p>Impurities, such as water, halides, unreacted organic salts, and organics, easily accumulate in ionic liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">16</ref> Users of ionic liquids should be aware of impurities that are to be expected, as these may influence the solvent properties <ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">17</ref> and/or interfere with the biocatalyst. Thus, it has recently been shown that small amounts of chloride ion cause a severe deactivation of two lipases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">18</ref> Some early results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids proved to be difficult to reproduce, probably due to the presence of such impurities. The purity issue, as well as the detection and removal of impurities, has been reviewed recently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">16</ref> Water is a common contaminant, as even water immiscible ionic liquids are hygroscopic and readily absorb a few percent of water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">17</ref> Such adventitious water in ionic liquids that contain [BF 4 ] or [PF 6 ] ions may cause partial hydrolysis of these latter anions with formation of HF, which inhibits many types of enzymes.</p><p>Significant results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids require careful attention to the purity issue. The contaminants in commercial ionic liquids are usually specified by the supplier. Ionic liquids for use in anhydrous systems should be kept free of water by storage over phosphorus pentoxide. Ionic liquids that contain hydrolyzable groups, such as [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions, require testing for acid prior to use. Ionic liquids prepared in-house via the chloride route should be assayed for halide, e.g., by a silver chromate test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Polarity</head><p>Ionic liquids are usually considered to be highly polar, on account of their ionic nature, but reality is much more checkered. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Solvent polarity, which should not be confused with hydrophilicity, is a complex concept, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19</ref> and it is highly unlikely that a single, universal scale will ever be defined. The subject of ionic liquid polarity has been addressed by a variety of methodologies, which will be reviewed briefly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">20</ref> The propensity of solvents to stabilize a charge is usually determined from the absorption maximum of a solvatochromic dye, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">21</ref> such as Nile Red <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">22</ref> or Reichardt's dye, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19</ref> or by using a fluorescent probe. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">23</ref> The method actually probes the H-bond donating propensitysR in Kamlet-Taft terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">24</ref> swhich, in ionic liquids, is a property of the cation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">25</ref> By this measure, the polarity of common ionic liquid types, such as the archetypical [BMIm][BF 4 ] (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table">4</ref>), is in the range of the lower alcohols <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[27]</ref> or formamide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">28</ref> A solvatochromic test for the coordination strength (nucleophilicity) of the anion, in contrast, indicates that the often used [PF 6 ] and [NTf 2 ] anions are much less nucleophilic (and, by implication, less "polar") than the lower alcohols. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">25</ref> Other aspects of polarity are dipolarity/polarizability and the H-bond accepting ability of the anion (π* and β in Kamlet-Taft terms), which have recently been measured using suitable solvatochromic dyes (see later). <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">29</ref> A completely different approach to solvent polarity is the measurement of keto-enol equilibria, as these are known to depend on the polarity of the medium. This latter methodology, when applied to probe the polarity of ionic liquids, indicated that [BMIm][BF 4 ], [BMIm][PF 6 ], and [BMIm][NTf 2 ] are more polar than methanol or acetonitrile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">30</ref> The dielectric constants of a number of ionic liquids have been calculated on the basis of microwave dielectric spectroscopy measurements. By this yardstick, the polarity of [BMIm][BF 4 ] and [BMIm] [PF 6 ] is in the range of a mediumchain alcohol, such as 1-hexanol or 1-octanol, with marked contributions from the anion as well the cation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">32</ref> Attempts to predict ionic liquid dielectric constants from solvatochromic shifts were often wide off the mark.</p><p>Simple chemical reasoning would predict that a polar medium would dissolve polar compounds, such as, for example, carbohydrates, quite well. By this measure, the ionic liquids [BMIm][BF 4 ], which is hydrophilic, and [BMIm]-[PF 6 ], which is hydrophobic, miserably fail the polarity test, because these dissolve less than 0.5 g/L of glucose at room temperature. <ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">34</ref> The concept of solvent polarity has proven useful with molecular solvents, because the outcomes based on chemical intuition and physical organic chemistry match quite well. With ionic liquids, in contrast, it would seem that the polarity concept is too elusive to serve as a basis to predict, for example, solubility behavior or reaction rate. There are, moreover, indications that solvent-solute interactions of ionic liquids obey a dual interaction model (i.e., ionic liquids behave like a nonpolar solvent with nonpolar solutes but display a polar character with polar solutes), even to the extent that ionic liquids should be regarded as nanostructured materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[37]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Solvent Properties and Miscibility of Ionic Liquids</head><p>Many compounds are sufficiently soluble in ionic liquids to perform reactions, and if this is not the case, a more suitable type of ionic liquid can be selected.

It was soon discovered, however, that even water-miscible ionic liquids, such as [BMIm][BF 4 ], do not dissolve simple sugars to an appreciable degree. [BMIm][Cl], in contrast, dissolves massive amounts of cellulose, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">39</ref> and it was demonstrated that the ability of ionic liquids to dissolve complex compounds, such as sugars and proteins, mainly depends on the H-bond accepting properties of the anion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">40</ref> The miscibility of ionic liquids and water varies widely and unpredictably.</p><p>[BMIm][BF 4 ] and [BMIm][MeSO 4 ] are water-miscible, but [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [BMIm][Tf 2 N] are not. These ionic liquids are of similar polarity on the Reichardt scale, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19</ref> and the coordination strengths of the [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions are also comparable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">25</ref> Neither is the partitioning of ionic liquids between water and 1-octanol a predictor of water miscibility, as the log P values of water immiscible [BMIm]-[PF 6 ] and water miscible [BMIm][AcO] and [BMIm][NO 3 ] are -2.4, -2.8, and -2.9, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">41</ref> A recent measurement of the H-bond accepting properties of such ionic liquids revealed, however, that [BF 4 ] and [MeSO 4 ] are better H-bond acceptors (β ) 0.61 and 0.75, respectively) than [PF 6 ] (β ) 0.50), <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">29</ref> which could go a long way in explaining the difference in water miscibility. It should be noted that aqueous mixtures of ionic liquids may not be homogeneous at molecular scale because, even in methanol, water does not mix at a molecular level but is mainly present as strings or clusters of molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">42</ref> Water-immiscible ionic liquids are nevertheless hygroscopic, as noted above, and readily absorb a few percent of water, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">17</ref> approximately corresponding with a hemihydrate. IR spectroscopic analysis has confirmed that water interacts mainly with the anion <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">43</ref> via the formation of double Hbonds, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">44</ref> at least when the cation is a weak hydrogen bond donor, as was the case here.</p><p>The miscibility behavior of ionic liquids and organic solvents is not well documented. A relationship with the dielectric constant has been proposed, as lower alcohols and ketones, dichloromethane, and THF ( ) 7.58) mix with, for example, [BMIm][Tf 2 N], whereas alkanes and ethers do not; ethyl acetate seems to be a borderline case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">45</ref> On the basis of the thermodynamic activity coefficients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">46</ref> it would seem that benzene, toluene, and styrene (but not the higher alkylbenzenes) dissolve in [BMPy][BF 4 ]. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) does not mix with ionic liquids, such as [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [OMIm][BF 4 ] but is absorbed in the ionic liquid phase in huge amounts (up to a molar fraction of 0.7). <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">47</ref> No ionic liquid dissolves in the CO 2 phase.</p><p>Summarizing, a theoretical basis for predicting the solvent properties of ionic liquids still has to be constructed. It has become clear, however, that ionic liquids do not fit into any of the standard heuristics that chemists traditionally use to assess and predict solvent behavior. What can be predicted, though, is that the characteristic property of some ionic liquids to mix neither with water nor with moderately nonpolar organic solvents will revolutionize process design.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Stability and Viscosity of Ionic Liquids</head><p>Ionic liquids are generally regarded as highly stable. The commonly used dialkylimidazolium ionic liquids are indeed thermostable up to 300 °C. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The propensity of the [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions to hydrolyze with liberation of HF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">48</ref> which deactivates many enzymes, has already been mentioned. The [TfO] and [NTf 2 ] anions are hydrolytically stable.</p><p>Dialkylimidazolium cations, in particular, have a tendency to deprotonate at C-2, with ylide (heterocarbene) formation. Such ylides are strong nucleophiles and have been used as transesterification catalysts, for example. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">49</ref> These could cause enzyme deactivation as well as background transesterification when formed in small amounts from anhydrous ionic liquids and basic buffer salts, for example.</p><p>The viscosity of ionic liquids is high compared with that of molecular solvents and increases with the chain length, among others. Consequently, diffusion is bound to be slow in ionic liquids. The effects on biocatalytic transformations seem to be insignificant, however, except in extreme cases, presumably because the reaction times are measured in hours rather than minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Ionic Liquids: Green Aspects</head><p>A major driving force behind ionic liquids development is the desire for greener procedures, for which purpose they are exquisitely suited, in principle, on account of their unconventional properties. The evident reservation here is that the ionic liquids themselves should be harmless, since any compound that is used on a large scale will find its way into the environment. The ionic liquids types that are used in biocatalysis research have not been designed for biocompatibility, however, nor for easy biodegradability. It has recently become clear that the ecotoxicity of alkylmethylimidazolium cations is undesirably high and increases with the alkyl chain length. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[52]</ref> To put the issue into perspective, the [BMIm] and [BPy] cations were half as toxic to Daphnia magna (EC 50 approximately 20 mg L -1 ) as toluene but the 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium ion was 2500 times more toxic (EC 50 4 µg‚L -1 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">51</ref> Moreover, the biodegradability of ionic liquids such as [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [BMIm][BF 4 ] is negligible; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">53</ref> hence, these should be expected to persist in the environment for long periods.</p><p>Consequently, for future industrial application, improved ionic liquids types will be required, which are now being developed.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Enzyme Structure</head><p>Every enzyme has a characteristic three-dimensional structure. This structure, which is a prerequisite for activity, is maintained by disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonding (including water networks), and hydrophobic interaction. This latter effect is not really an interaction, apart from some slight Van der Waals contribution, but rather is the entropy-driven exclusion of hydrophobic groups from contact with water, which causes these to be buried in the protein structure. Even under physiological conditions, the stability margin of dissolved proteins is only a precarious 20-60 kJ mol -1 . <ref type="bibr">57</ref> Unfolding requires the dissociation of many hydrogen bonds at the same time and brings the buried hydrophobic groups into contact with the solvent. Consequently, proteins are destabilized by compounds that interact specifically with the unfolded protein. It is widely accepted, on the basis of deactivation kinetics, that unfolding proceeds through two stages: a reversible first stage, followed by a slower, irreversible step.</p><p>Water, the natural medium of enzyme catalysis, interacts sufficiently strongly to dissolve enzymes, but not strong enough to dissociate the structural hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that enzyme solutions in pure water are often unstable, which is why they are commonly kept in phosphate or citrate buffers. This latter stabilizing effect can be ascribed to "salting out" of hydrophobic groups, which increases the energy barrier to unfolding and exposure of such groups. Enzyme dehydration, for example by lyophilization, causes structural changes that have been confirmed spectroscopically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">59</ref> These can be ascribed to Coulombic interactions between charged groups, which are up to 80 times stronger in a low dielectric constant medium than in water, as well as to loss of water networks. The combined effects usually are a general tightening of the structure. A detailed FT-IR study of Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB), for example, showed that β-sheets increased at the expense of R-helices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">60</ref> Lyoprotectants, such as sucrose or trehalose, stabilize the native structure while lyophilizing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Enzymes in Organic Media</head><p>The seminal work by Klibanov in the early 1980s <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">62</ref> made it clear that enzymes can be used in hydrophobic organic solvents, although at the price of a severely reduced reaction rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">64</ref> It subsequently became clear that many lipases, as well as some proteases and acylases, are so stable that they maintain their activity even in anhydrous organic solvents. This latter characteristic is at the basis of the successful application of such hydrolases in nonhydrolytic reactions, such as the (enantioselective) acylation of alcohols and amines, which now are major industrial applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">65</ref> Interference of organic media, including ionic liquids, with enzyme activity is often discussed in terms of removal of essential water. Many enzymes indeed require a full hydration shell to be active, but there are numerous exceptions, such as CaLB, which maintains its activity upon drying over phosphorus pentoxide, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">66</ref> and the protease subtilisin, which requires only a few tightly bound water molecules per molecule of enzyme to be active. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">67</ref> It is now commonly accepted that water requirements should be discussed in terms of the thermodynamic water activity a w rather than water concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">64</ref> It should be noted that performing nonhydrolytic reactions with lipases or proteases in the presence of small amounts of water, to maintain or improve the activity, will nearly always give rise to hydrolytic side reactions. The resulting acid may cause the pH to drift and the enzyme to lose its activity.</p><p>The solvents that are tolerated well by these hydrolasess aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and alcohols (excluding methanol)-interact only weakly, and one would surmise that these are more or less like a vacuum to the enzyme. Only alcohols, which are H-bond donors and acceptors, are known to inhibit lipases. Solvents that do interact strongly with proteins, such as DMSO and DMF, even to the extent of dissolving them, also tend to cause irreversible loss of activity. Thus, our starting hypothesis is that enzymes do not tolerate strong interactions with any solvent, except water.</p><p>A complicating factor in nonaqueous enzymology is that the pH is undefined. It has been shown that enzymes tend to maintain the charge distribution (apparent pH) corresponding with the last aqueous solution, the lyophilization buffer, for example. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">61</ref> The optimum apparent pH may shift under the influence of the solvent type and a w , however. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">68</ref> Similar effects would be expected in ionic liquid media.</p><p>The general desire to improve the low turnover rate of enzymes in organic media was a major driving force for extending the method to ionic liquids. These low (compared with aqueous medium) turnover rates are mainly, but not exclusively, caused by reactant stabilization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">63</ref> This latter effect, which is equivalent with increased solubility, is translated kinetically into an increase in K m and can be remedied by performing reactions at increased concentrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">69</ref> The remaining rate loss, 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, is ascribed to the combined effects of destabilization of the transition state, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70</ref> conformational changes, and loss of flexibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70</ref> Transition state destabilization is caused by the low dielectric constant of common organic media, which increases the energy of the highly polarized transition state in comparison with water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70</ref> Thus, the expectation that ionic liquids, on the basis of their highly polar nature, could remedy the transition state destabilization, the conformational change caused by dehydration, and the loss of flexibility seemed by no means unreasonable.</p><p>Many modes of biocatalysis in ionic liquids have been demonstrated. Mixed aqueous-ionic liquid media have been usedsto improve the solubility of hydrophobic reactants and products. Monophasic ionic liquids with little or no water present have been employed, as well as biphasic ionic liquid-scCO 2 media. In such solvent systems, the biocatalyst is in direct contact with the ionic liquid. There is little or no such contact, in contrast, when reactions are conducted in biphasic aqueous-ionic liquid or ionic liquid-organic media; hence, enzyme-ionic liquid incompatibilities are not to be expected. One exception concerns biotransformations with living cells, since ionic liquids, even when they are in a separate phase, may be toxic to the cells.</p><p>In the following section, the interactions of aqueous electrolyte solutions and enzymes will be briefly introduced, followed by reviews of activity and stability studies concerning enzymes and ionic liquid-water mixtures, enzymes in ionic liquids with little or no water present, and biotransformations with living cells in aqueous ionic liquid media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Proteins, Water, and Electrolytes</head><p>Water is a nanostructured material that consists of a mixture of rapidly equilibrating low-and high-density microdomains, which differ up to 30% in density. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">71</ref> The complex interactions between proteins and electrolyte solutions have been studied for more than a century, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">73</ref> and a brief survey of the field would seem useful, as ionic liquids are also electrolytes.</p><p>Hofmeister arranged cations and anions in series according to their effects on protein stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">72</ref> These Hofmeister series loosely correlate with the kosmotropic vs chaotropic character of the ions, which describes their interactions with water and their effects on the equilibrium of low-and high-density water. Both approaches nowadays are often regarded as more or less identical. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">74</ref> Kosmotropicity and chaotropicity are quantified by the Jones-Dole viscosity B-coefficients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">76</ref> as well as a number of other thermodynamic parameters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">74</ref> Kosmotropic ions, such as SO 4 2-, AcO -, Mg 2+ , and Ca 2+ , have a high charge density, interact more strongly with water than water interacts with itself, and partition into high-density water. Micro-osmotic effects cause a readjustment of the water equilibrium toward low-density water. With chaotropic ions, such as ClO 4 -, PF 6 -, NH 4 + , and Cs + , the situation is reversed. These interact weakly with water because their charge density is low, partition into low-density water, and shift the water equilibrium toward high-density water. Enzyme solutions are stabilized by kosmotropic anions and chaotropic cations, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, but are destabilized by chaotropic anions and kosmotropic cations. It should be emphasized that kosmotropicity and chaotropicity are not unambiguously defined and may either refer to their charge density or refer to effects on proteins or the Jones-Dole viscosity B-constant.</p><p>The analysis of Hofmeister effects at the molecular level is highly complex, and understanding is far from complete; various aspects have been reviewed recently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[79]</ref> A basic issue is whether Hofmeister effects on proteins (and other biomolecules) result from direct interactions with ions or are indirect, i.e., caused by changes in the water structure. It has even been argued, on the basis of pressure perturbation calorimetry measurements, that correlations of solute kosmotropicity/chaotropicity with protein stabilization/destabilization are fortuitous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">80</ref> The best explanation, so far, would seem that kosmotropic anions stabilize proteins by "salting out" the nonpolar surface groups, whereas chaotropic, denaturing anions, e.g., I -and SCN -, and kosmotropic cations, such as Ca 2+ , "salt in" the peptide moiety and consequently interact more strongly with the unfolded form of the protein than with the native one. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">77</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Enzymes in Aqueous Ionic Liquid Mixtures</head><p>Mixed aqueous-organic media are often used in biotransformations to increase the solubility of hydrophic reactant and products, which stimulates interest in aqueous ionic liquid mixtures. The stability and activity of enzymes in aqueous ionic liquids are often discussed in terms of Hofmeister effects. We emphasize, however, that the cations in common ionic liquids do not easily fit into the kosmotropicity vs chaotropicity pattern set out above. The tetrabutylammonium ion, for example, should be a strong chaotrope, with a predicted B-coefficient of -0.54 on account of its charge density, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">74</ref> whereas the experimental value is +1.27 (between Sr 2+ and Ca 2+ ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">76</ref> This latter effect is caused by the clathrate shell of highly ordered water that encloses hydrophobic solutes and has been likened to an iceberg; <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">81</ref> the resulting increase in low-density water, proportional with the size of the solute, translates into a kosmotropic effect on viscosity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">82</ref> An early study of the alkaline phosphatase from E. coli in aqueous mixtures of [EtNH 3 ][NO 3 ]swhich is also the oldest ionic liquid on record <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">83</ref> srevealed an activating effect at low concentrations, reaching an optimum at 1.1 M (10%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">84</ref> The activity steeply decreased at higher concentrations but was recovered upon dilution to 1.1 M. At 80% [EtNH 3 ]-[NO 3 ], however, all activity was irreversibly lost. Such a profile would not be unexpected for denaturating salts or organic solvents.</p><p>Recent work in the field of biocatalysis in ionic liquidwater mixtures involves a wide range of enzymes and ionic liquids. To create some order, the ionic liquids will be loosely arranged according to the position of the anion in the Hofmeister series, from stabilizing to destabilizing (kosmotropic to chaotropic).</p><p>Strongly kosmotropic anions have not been frequently applied in ionic liquids, but [HOEtMe 3 N][citrate], which is composed of two hydrogen bond forming ions, is an exception. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">85</ref> Chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago (CPO) catalyzed a sulfoxidation reaction in aqueous mixtures that contained up to 70% of this latter ionic liquid. CPO also tolerated up to 70% of [MMIm][Me 2 PO 4 ]; there was a remarkable dip in activity at 30% ionic liquid and a maximum (210% of the activity in water) at 50%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">85</ref> These results seem to confirm the tolerance of CPO for watermiscible organic solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">86</ref> The formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii (CbFDH) and the β-galactosidase from Bacillus circulans have been subjected to a stability study in a wide range of ionic liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">87</ref> [Et 3 NH][MeSO 4 ] deactivated both enzymes, but the rather similar ionic liquid [Et 3 MeN][MeSO 4 ] was tolerated by CbFDH (55% residual activity in 50% aqueous medium). It is noteworthy that the [Et 3 NH] cation is a weak Brønsted acid (pKa 11) that, at the approximately 2 M concentration used, may exhaust the buffer capacity, shift the pH toward acid, and deactivate the enzymes. In 50% aqueous [MMIm][MeSO 4</p><p>], CbFDH as well as the β-galactosidase from B. circulans remained active (CbFDH, 73%; β-galactosidase, 14% residual activity). The β-galactosidase even had some residual activity when only 0.6% of water was present, <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">88</ref> which has never been observed with glycosidases in molecular organic solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">89</ref> The β-galactosidase from the hyperthermophilic archeon Pyrococcus furiosus also was fully active in 50% [MMIm][MeSO 4 ] at 80 °C, but (reversible) deactivation resulted from exposure to 70% ionic liquid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">90</ref> In contrast, the activity of the mandelate racemase from Pseudomonas putida in aqueous [MMIm][MeSO 4 ] declined in a direct relationship with the water activity a w ; in 50% ionic liquid, which corresponds with a w ) 0.8, only a few percent of the native activity was left. <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">91</ref> A dried-cell preparation of Geotrichum candidum likewise lost its alcohol dehydrogenase activity in 60% <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">92</ref> The [AcO] anion is also a kosmotrope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">74</ref> A 30% concentration of [HOEtMe 3 N][AcO] at pH 6 had little effect on CPO. Adjustment of the pH to 4.8 by adding AcOH remarkably caused a severe drop in activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">85</ref> CPO is acidtolerant, and perhaps it was the high concentration of nonionized AcOH, rather than the ionic liquid, that caused the activity loss. 0.7 M [BPy][AcO] caused protease P to lose approximately 30% of its original activity in a standard assay (hydrolysis of Ts-L-Arg-OMe), but [EMIm][AcO] surprisingly exerted an activating effect of approximately 20%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">93</ref> Another protease, papain from Papaya latex, maintained 75% of its original activity in 15% [BMIm][AcO]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">94</ref> Subtilisin Carlsberg was little affected by 1 M [EMIm][AcO], but larger concentrations caused a partial activity loss (75% residual activity at 2 M concentration, 20% at 4 M). <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">95</ref> The enantioselectivity in the test reaction (hydrolysis of D,L-Phe- OMe) was maintained up to 4 M [EMIm][AcO], in contrast with 2 M ACN, which caused a severe loss of enantioselectivity. The structure of subtilisin Carlsberg was unaffected by 2 M [EMIm][AcO], as judged by the FT-IR spectrum in the amide I region, whereas a featureless spectrum resulted in the presence of 4 M ionic liquid or 2 M ACN. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">95</ref> The anions of R-amino acids, which have recently been applied to ionic liquids, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">55</ref> are kosmotropes on account of their viscosity B-coefficients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">97</ref> Ionic liquids composed of D-and L-R-amino acid anions, as well as ω-aminocarboxylates, and the [EMIm] cation had, at 0.5 M concentration, little effect on the hydrolytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg.

The β-galactosidase was not active either, however, in a 25% solution of the neutral [BMIm][TfO], although this latter ionic liquid was tolerated by CbFDH. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">87</ref> Protease P was even more severely affected by neutral [EMIm][TsO] than by the basic acetate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">93</ref> In contrast, the hydrolytic activity of subtilisin Carlsberg was comparable between 0.5 M [EMIm][TsO] and aqueous buffer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">102</ref> Nitrate-containing ionic liquids have not been used much, although they would seem attractive, as the nitrate ion is innocuous and chemically inert.

The effects of [BMIm][BF 4 ] on the activity of HRP were comparable with those of the chloride: up to 20% ionic liquid, the activity loss was minor, but it increased to approximately 30% in 25% ionic liquid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">98</ref> The very similar ionic liquid [BMPy][BF 4 ], at 25% concentration, affected HRP more severely, and the activity was reduced by 50%, while soybean peroxidase retained only 25% of its initial activity under these conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">103</ref> [BMIm][BF 4 ] also profoundly changed the thermal deactivation kinetics of HRP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">98</ref> At 10% concentration, the ionic liquid retarded the thermal deactivation of HRP, but 25% of [BMIm][BF 4 ], in contrast, caused a fairly rapid deactivation (3 h at 50 °C) to a residual activity of 7%, which did not decay any further. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">98</ref> It would seem that these conditions cause HRP to flip into a thermally stable, but 16 times less active conformation.</p><p>CbFDH was completely inactive when incubated in 25% aqueous [BMIm][BF 4 ], but the β-galactosidase from B. circulans retained 31% of its initial activity in this latter medium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">87</ref> In contrast, the β-galactosidase from P. furiosus was reversibly deactivated by only 10% [BMIm][BF 4 ] <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">90</ref> and the one from E. coli had 36% activity left in 50% [BMIm]-[BF 4 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">104</ref> To put this latter observation into perspective, the residual activities of the E. coli enzyme in 50% aqueous ethanol and ACN amounted to 7% and 3%, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">104</ref> Savinase, a commercial subtilisin-type protease, maintained 37% of its activity in 50% [BMIm][BF 4 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">104</ref> In 15% [EMIm][BF 4 ], the activity of the papain from P. latex was 175% of the original activity and decreased with increasing chain length in the imidazolium ion to 100% in [HMIm]-[BF 4 ]-water (15:85). <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">94</ref> In these media, β-sheets and β-turns increased at the expense of R-helices, as shown by changes in the FT-IR spectrum, and the fluorescence emission blueshifted, which suggests a tightening of the structure. In the presence of [HSO 4 ]-, [Cl]-, [AcO]-, and [NO 3 ]-containing ionic liquids, in contrast, the fluorescence emission was shifted toward red, which indicates unfolding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">94</ref> The oxynitrilase from almonds was somewhat activated by a few percent of [BMIm][BF 4 ] and similar ionic liquids, but concentrations &gt;10% caused a loss of activity down to 50% residual activity at 50% concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">105</ref> The (structurally unrelated) oxynitrilase from manioc (MeHNL), in contrast, was strongly inhibited even by small amounts of these ionic liquids. It may be noteworthy that incubation of these enzymes in [BMIm][BF 4 ], followed by rehydration, resulted in the recovery of approximately 85% of the initial activity, whereas the irreversible deactivation by ACN or THF amounted to 50-70%. <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">105</ref> A very similar ionic liquid, [BMPy][BF 4 ], caused, at 25% concentration, the nearly complete deactivation of the laccase from Trametes sp. in one reaction, but in others the activity retention was very much dependent on the electron transport mediator used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">103</ref> Ionic liquids that contain amphiphilic ions have not yet seen much use in biocatalysis. The effect of [BMIm][OctSO 4 ] on the β-galactosidase from B. circulans was very similar to that of [BMIm][BF 4 ]; 35 and 10% of the initial activity was retained at 25% and 50% ionic liquid, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">87</ref> The deactivation of the amphiphilic [TsO] ion on Protease P has already been mentioned. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">93</ref> Small amounts of amphiphilic ionic liquids exerted a beneficial effect on porcine liver esterase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">106</ref> as will be discussed later.</p><p>Summarizing, many enzymes perform well in a wide range of mixtures of ionic liquids and water. There is, moreover, hardly an ionic liquid that is not tolerated at all by any enzyme. Kosmotropicity vs chaotropicity does not seem a solid basis for predicting the compatibility of enzymes and aqueous ionic liquids, in spite of lengthy arguments to the contrary. The chaotropic [Cl] and [BF 4 ] anions, for example, were tolerated well by many enzymes, and the papain from P. latex was stabilized, as judged by fluorescence spectroscopy, by the chaotropic [BF 4 ] anion whereas partial unfolding was observed in the presence of kosmotropic [AcO]. It is worth repeating that kosmotropicity vs chaotropicity are not unambiguously defined for many types of ions that are discussed here.</p><p>It even seems unlikely that enzyme-ionic liquid compatibility can be rationalized at all in terms of one or a few parameters, such as polarity, which is ill-defined for ionic liquids, or log P. The same is true, however, for watermiscible molecular solvents. A successful theory to predict the compatibility of enzymes and aqueous ionic liquids could be based on the notion that proteins lose stability in the presence of ions or solvents that interact more strongly with the unfolded enzyme than with the native one. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">77</ref> Such destabilizing interactions could result from "salting in" effects of amphiphilic ions on buried hydrophobic groups or from strong (hydrogen bonding) interactions with peptide bonds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">94</ref> Further important issues to consider are possible pH shifts caused by Brønsted-acidic or basic ions and the thermodynamic water activity, in particular with sensitive enzymes.</p></div>

It may be relevant that purified CrL was not active in any ionic liquid tested and not even in TBME. <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">107</ref> Esterases are much less tolerant of anhydrous media than lipases.

Hence, the potential of alkylmethylimidazolium-type ionic liquids containing [PF 6 ] and [NTf 2 ] anions as media in the oxidation of 2-methoxyphenol in the presence of hemin, microperoxidase-11 (MP-11), and cytochrome c (cyt c) has been investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">129</ref> Hemin and MP-11 were markedly more active in the ionic liquids than in molecular solvents of the same polarity, while cyt c activity was comparable between both types of solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">129</ref>      <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">128</ref> The lyophilization of enzymes from solutions containing salts or amphiphilic compounds is known to increase the activity in organic media by up to several orders of magnitude.

PsL adsorbed on a methacryloxypropylmodified mesoporous silica also had a relatively high activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">136</ref> The completely different application of ionic liquids, as a coating for lipases, should not pass unmentioned. PcL was coated with [PhPMIm][PF 6 ], which melts at 53 °C, and the resulting preparation was applied to the kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols at temperatures below the melting point. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">137</ref> The coated lipase was easy to reuse and retained its full activity after being reused for several times. A very similar technique has been demonstrated with PsL and the ionic liquids [BMIm][CtPEGSO 4 ] and [BMMIm][CtPEGSO 4 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">138</ref> The tolerance of lipases for anhydrous ionic liquid media discussed above was not universal.

It may be significant that the lipases dissolved in such media, <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">139</ref> because dissolving a protein requires the breaking of the protein-protein interactions and replacing these by stronger ones. Water has this effect, but the organic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide, which dissolve enzymes and, by implication, coordinate groups at the protein surface, also are strong denaturants. It was subsequently shown, in a more extensive investigation, that CaLB mediated transesterification in ionic liquids composed of the [BMIm] cation and short-chain alkylsulfate or alkoxyethylsulfate anions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">140</ref> The reactions were quite sluggish, compared with the case of [BMIm][PF 6 ], and the rate increased somewhat with increasing alkyl chain length. It is noteworthy that CrL was catalytically active in [BMIm][MeSO 4 ], in contrast with CaLB, and [BMIm]-[OctSO 4 ] at a higher rate than in [BMIm][PF 6 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">120</ref> To support the notion that hydrophilic ionic liquids induce conformational changes that result in the deactivation of CaLB, we measured FT-IR spectra in the amide I region and found a loss of detail that was consistent with our conjecture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">141</ref> Furthermore, the denaturation of lysozyme upon its dissolution in [EtNH 3 ][NO 3 ] has actually been observed using fluorescence spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">142</ref> It has already been noted that the [MeSO 4 ] anion is not compatible with many lipases. This is not a general phenomenon, as the β-galactosidase from B. circulans, which maintained 14% residual activity in 50% aqueous [MMIm]-[MeSO 4 ], <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">87</ref> also had some useful activity left in the presence of only 0.6% of water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">88</ref> These same authors found that the peptide amidase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia still fuctioned in [BMIm][MeSO 4 ] containing only trace amounts of water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">88</ref> When considering the preceding examples, the possibilities for the application of halide ionic liquids as biocatalysis media do not look bright, which is unfortunate, as [BMIm]-[Cl] is a strong solvent that dissolves recalcitrant cellulose in massive amounts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">39</ref> It was indeed found that the cellulase from Trichoderma reesei was not active in [BMIm][Cl] and the protein was observed to denature by fluorescence spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">143</ref> A colyophilizate of the cellulase and poly-(ethylene glycol) was more stable and maintained approximately 50% of its native activity. It would seem that attempts to conduct biotransformations in ionic liquids that contained adventituous chloride may have caused erratic results in the past. <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">144</ref>  The obvious conclusion so far is that enzyme activity and solubility in ionic liquids are anion dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">41</ref> and mutually exclusive. The behavior of CaLB in [Et 3 MeN][MeSO 4 ] did not correspond with the simple pattern set out above, however, as a modest transesterification activity was maintained, even with small amounts of enzyme which were observed to dissolve. To confirm this latter observation, a reaction was performed with a presaturated solution of CaLB in [Et 3 MeN][MeSO 4 ], which was estimated to contain, on the basis of the conversion, approximately 3 mg mL -1 of CaLB. <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">141</ref> The FT-IR spectrum confirmed that the native conformation of CaLB had survived.</p><p>Apparently, ionic liquids can be designed to dissolve enzymes without denaturation. Accordingly, morphine dehydrogenase (MDH), when dissolved in the strongly hydrogen bonding ionic liquid [HOPMIm][glycolate], mediated the oxidation of codeine into codeinone (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) under nearly anhydrous conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">145,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">146</ref> The activity was less than that in water but better than that shown by suspensions in molecular solvents or [BMIm][PF 6 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">146</ref> As additional advantages, the reactant and the NADP cofactor dissolved in [HOPMIm][glycolate] and the ionic liquid proved suitable for the subsequent chemical transformation of codeinone into oxycodone as well. <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">145</ref> The ionic liquid was also compatible with an enzymatic recycle system for the NADP cofactor (see Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">146</ref> The redox protein cyt c dissolved in the ionic liquids [MPPrl][H 2 PO 4 ] and [HOEtMe 3 N][H 2 PO 4 ]; <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">147</ref> it is interesting to note that here a hydrogen bonding capability of the cation is not required, in contrast with the previous example. FT-IR measurements showed that cyt c maintained its native secondary structure upon dissolution in these ionic liquids.</p><p>An alternative to engineering the ionic liquid is to modify the enzyme for solubility. This approach was demonstrated with cyt c, which, when covalently modified with poly-(ethylene oxide), dissolved in its active form in [EMIm]-[NTf 2 ]. The best results were obtained when the molecular weight of the polymer chains was &gt;2000. <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">148</ref> A copolymer of PEG and maleic anhydride solubilized subtilisin in [EMIm][NTf 2 ] and a range of similar ionic liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">149,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">150</ref> The resulting conjugate was approximately 3 times as active as a PEG-subtilisin one and many times more than a suspension of native subtilisin in the same medium.</p><p>The structural changes, discussed above, that have been observed when an enzyme is dissolved in an ionic liquid are often reversible. Thus, when a solution of lysozyme in [EtNH 3 ][NO 3 ] was diluted with water, the denatured enzyme recovered its full activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">142</ref> The ionic liquid is actively involved as a renaturation enhancer, because it was shown in separate experiments that 5% aqueous [EtNH 3 ][NO 3 ] acts as a renaturant on lysozyme. Indeed, 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium and 1-ω-hydroxylalkyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides have potential as renaturation enhancers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">151</ref> In a likewise manner, a substantial fraction of the original activity was recovered fromsinactivessolutions of CaLB in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">139</ref> The β-galactosidase from B. circulans, which was hardly active in pure [MMIm]-[MeSO 4 ], completely recovered its activity upon dilution with water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">87</ref> In summary, anhydrous ionic liquids seem to affect enzymes in much the same way that conventional organic solvents do: some are tolerated well but others much less, also depending on the nature of the enzyme. It is noteworthy that ionic liquids containing anions such as [AcO] or [NO 3 ], which were tolerated very well in aqueous mixtures, caused the deactivation of the very stable CaLB when anhydrous. On the basis of the present knowledge, ionic liquids composed of [BF 4 ], [PF 6 ], and the, hydrolytically stable, [NTf 2 ] and medium-chain alkyl sulfate anions seem safe choices, in combination with dialkylimidazolium and alkylpyridium cations.</p><p>A theoretical basis for predicting the compatibility of enzymes and anhydrous ionic liquids has not yet been developed although a number of possibly contributing factors have been discussed, such as the cation H-bond donating capability, <ref type="bibr">33</ref> log P, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">41</ref> formation of hydrogen-bonded nanostructures, and solvent viscosity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">152</ref> None of these seems generally applicable, however. It would rather seem, on the basis of the available evidence, that the anion nucleophilicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">41</ref> or H-bond accepting capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">139</ref> is a controlling factor, at least when the propensity of the cation for hydrogen bond formation is low. One exception is the [H 2 PO 4 ] anion, which actually dissolved cyt c without causing denaturation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">147</ref> The other exception, [HOPMIm][glycolate], which dissolved redox enzymes in active form, is in a class of its own by combining a strongly hydrogen bonding cation and anion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">146</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Stability of Enzymes in Nearly Anhydrous Ionic Liquids</head><p>The (thermal) stability (activity over time) of enzymes is often better in organic media, in particular at low water activity, than in aqueous medium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">153</ref> Ionic liquids can also have this effect. We note that enzyme stability is not unambiguously defined and procedures to measure stability vary. Storage stability is measured by incubation in, for example, an ionic liquid, at a certain temperature, by monitoring the residual activity in samples after dilution with water. A high activity recovery in such a procedure only proves that any changes of the enzyme in the storage medium are reversible. Alternatively, the preincubation time before performing a reaction in the same medium can be varied or the enzyme's structure in the medium of choice can be monitored spectroscopically. Thus, it was shown, using fluorescence spectrometry, that the unfolding temperature of the sweet-tasting protein monellin increased from 40 °C in water to 105 °C in [BMPrl][NTf 2 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">154</ref> Finally, there is operational stability: activity over time under the reaction conditions.</p><p>The storage stability of cyt c in aqueous buffer is modest, but solutions in [HOEtMe 3 N][H 2 PO 4 ] or [BMPrl][H 2 PO 4 ] maintained their activity for at least 6 months.

In contrast, a linear deactivation versus time was observed in tert-butyl alcohol. The activity of Novozym 435 even increased to 350% in 40 h, which, on continued incubation, slowly decreased to 210% after 120 h. In contrast, the incubation of a CLEC or CLEA <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">158</ref> of CaLB in [BMIm][PF 6 ] at 80 °C resulted in a progressive loss of activity, comparable with that observed in tert-butyl alcohol.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Enzymes, Ionic Liquids, Hydrogen Bonds, and Activity</head><p>Hydrogen bonds cement the structure of hydrated as well as dehydrated enzymes. Any structural change requires a considerable number of hydrogen bonds to dissociate at the same time, which may contribute significantly to enzyme stability and could also explain hydration-memory and hysteresis effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">69</ref> It is commonly observed that enzymes, when suspended in an organic solvent, maintain their activity over a longer period than when dissolved in aqueous buffer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">64</ref> The obvious reason is that breaking and remaking hydrogen bonds is bound to be slower in a non-hydrogen bond forming medium. It should be kept in mind, however, that the hydrophobic effect, which significantly contributes to protein stabilization, does not exist in organic solvents. Summarizing, organic media reduce the thermodynamic stability of enzymes but enhance the kinetic stability and this latter effect predominates. This overall stabilizing effect is still more pronounced in ionic liquids.</p><p>It is worth noting here the common experience that solvents that are tolerated when nearly anhydrous or in dilute aqueous solution, such as ACN or tert-butyl alcohol, cause deactivation at an intermediate concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">164</ref> A similar conclusion can be distilled from experiments with enzymes in ionic liquids. The obvious explanation is that the hydrophobic effect decreases in the presence of a solvent. Consequently, the stability margin of the enzyme is eroded until, at a certain concentration, deactivation results.</p><p>With regard to the compatibility of enzymes and anhydrous ionic liquids, hydrogen bonding could be the key to understanding. Ionic liquids, in particular their anions, that form strong hydrogen bonds may dissociate the hydrogen bonds that maintain the structural integrity of the R-helices and β-sheets, causing the protein to unfold wholly or partially. The lactate ion, for example, could easily form stable hydrogen bonds with the polypeptide backbone. Ion size could matter because sterically demanding ions would require many hydrogen bonds to be broken to create a few new ones, which could contribute to maintaining stability.</p><p>We have already noted that the deactivation of CaLB by [BMIm][NO 3 ], for example, is partially reversible. This finding is in agreement with the generally adopted kinetic model of enzyme deactivation, which involves a reversible first step and an irreversible second one. CaLB deactivation by [BMIm][dca], in contrast, was irreversible and a small angle neutron scattering experiment indicated the formation of aggregates, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">165</ref> as is often observed upon unfolding. Presumably, hydrogen bonds also maintain the conformation of reversibly deactivated enzymes. Reconstitution requires these hydrogen bonds to be dissociated and remade into the native ones. Dilute denaturants often facilitate reconstitution, which includes denaturing ionic liquids, as discussed above. Presumably, such strongly hydrogen bonding compounds facilitate the reconstitution by forming transient hydrogen bonds.</p></div>

Because the monoacylated product (2, see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>) is more soluble in traditional solvents than the starting compound, the former tends to undergo further acylation into a diester (3). In contrast, the CaLB-catalyzed esterification of glucose with vinyl acetate in the ionic liquid [EMIm][BF 4 ] was completely selective. The reaction became much faster, and somewhat less selective, when conducted in [MOEMIm]-[BF 4 ], in which 5 g‚L -1 of glucose dissolves at 55 °C (100 times more than in acetone). <ref type="bibr">33</ref> The disaccharide maltose also was acylated in the presence of CaLB in [MOEMIm][BF 4 ]. <ref type="bibr">33</ref> The synthesis of long chain fatty acid esters of carbohydrates is inherently more demanding.

Hence, their acylation with vinyl butyrate in ionic liquid medium, in the presence of a number of lipases, has been investigated. Besides CaLB (Novozym 435), immobilized TlL and RmL were employed. In [BMIm][BF 4 ], the activity of the biocatalysts increased in the order CaLB &lt; TlL &lt; RmL, changing into TlL ∼ RmL &lt; CaLB in [BMIm][PF 6 ]; CrL was not active. <ref type="bibr" target="#b212">193</ref> Naringin, which contains a glucose moiety with a free primary alcohol group (at C-6′′), was acylated selectively at this latter position.

The chiral amines 34 and 35 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">23</ref>) have been acylated with acids, rather than the usual activated ester, in a range of ionic liquids. CaLB was employed as the biocatalyst and water was removed to shift the equilibrium toward the product. 217,218 Amine 34 was quantitatively resolved in a wide range of ionic liquids at a rate that depended on the medium. The highest rates were found in It could be surmised, for example, that blocking the mildly acidic position at C-2 in the imidazolium ring with a methyl group would obviate undesirable interactions with the amine reactant, but no such systematic effect became apparent, as such ionic liquids were involved in both the fastest and the slowest reactions. Amine 35 was resolved with a quite modest enantiomeric ratio of 2-3, which is not surprising, as the nitrogen atom is separated from the chiral center by a methylene group. Here, the rate also was strongly medium dependent, but without any obvious similarity with 34. <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">218</ref> Summarizing, it has become clear that the medium, either ionic liquid or traditional, has to be fine-tuned to the reactant and biocatalyst for optimum enantiorecognition. In other words, there is no "best" ionic liquid for performing a kinetic resolution, just as there is no "best" organic solvent in general and the theoretical basis for selecting one is still embryonic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">219</ref> With the advent of ionic liquids, the choice of solvents and thus the chance to find one that is satisfactory has increased enormously.</p></div>

[BMIm][NTf 2 ] was found to meet this latter requirement, and accordingly, the reduction rate of 2-octanone into (S)-55, catalyzed by Lactobacillus breVis alcohol dehydrogenase, was much higher in a biphasic buffer-[BMIm][NTf 2 ] system than in buffer-TBME or pure buffer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b245">230</ref> Rather less attention has been paid to enzymatic oxidations in ionic liquids. CPO catalyzed the chemo-and enantioselective sulfoxidation of thioanisole (56a, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_37">32</ref>) in aqueous mixtures that contained up to 50% [HOEtMe 3 N],</p><p>[citrate], or [MMIm][Me 2 PO 4 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">85</ref> In-situ generation of the hydrogen peroxide could be an attractive proposition that is well suited to the unconventional behavior of ionic liquids. Hydrogen peroxide was generated from the autoxidation of glucose in the presence of glucose oxidase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_38">33</ref>). Subsequently, the peroxidase from Coprinus cinereus (CiPx) converted the sulfides 56a and 56b into their respective sulfoxides (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_35">30</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b246">231</ref> The reaction was carried out in [BMIm][PF 6 ]-buffer (90:10, optimum).</p><p>The conversions were rather modest (&lt;32%) and 57a was only &lt;70% enantiomerically pure, but the naphthyl analogue (57b) was obtained with &gt;90% ee.</p><p>Oxidations catalyzed by monooxygenases are preferably carried out with whole-cell biocatalysts, because of the complex cofactor recycling in such enzyme systems. An E. coli that recombinantly expressed a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, cyclohexane monooxygenase (CHMO), catalyzed the regioselective oxidation of bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one (58) into the lactones (1S,5R)-59 and (1R,5S)-60 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_39">34</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Lyases: Oxynitrilase</head><p>The (R)-and (S)-selective oxynitrilases (hydroxynitrile lyases, HnL), which catalyze the addition of HCN to aldehydes, are undergoing a rapid transition from laboratory curiosities into industrial biocatalysts. The reaction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_40">35</ref>) suffers from competition with nonselective chemical hydrocyanation, which tends to reduce the enantiomeric purity of the product. The nonenzymatic hydrocyanation is commonly suppressed by maintaining an acidic environment and by the use of a biphasic, aqueous-organic reaction medium. In such systems, the nonenzymatic hydrocyanation is retarded because the aldehyde concentration in the aqueous phase is reduced, which affects the rate of the chemical reaction much more than the rate of the enzymatic reaction. Chemical hydrocyanation, moreover, requires a polar medium and does not occur readily in solvents such as TBME or toluene.</p><p>Hydrocyanation of benzaldehyde (61a) in the presence of the (R)-selective HnL from almonds (PaHnL) or the (S)-    selective one from HeVa brasiliensis (HbHnL), when carried out in the ionic liquids [EMIm][BF 4 ], [PMIm][BF 4 ], and [BMIm][BF 4 ]</p><p>, was fast, but only racemic product was formed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">232</ref> Evidently, the contribution of the enzymatic reaction is negligible under these conditions.</p><p>Better results were obtained in 50% aqueous mixtures of these ionic liquids; the reactions were much faster than those in biphasic aqueous-TBME medium, but hydrocyanations in the presence of HbHnL continued to be plagued by nonenzymatic hydrocyanation and the ee's were low. With PaHnL, in contrast, efficient hydrocyanation of the less reactive aldehydes (61b-d) was accomplished with a satisfactory ee. <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">232</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Catalyst Recycling</head><p>As previously mentioned, ionic liquids, such as [BMIm]-[PF 6 ], do not mix with ethers. This unconventional behavior was advantageously used by extracting the products and the unconverted reactant from the transesterification mixture of 25 (see Scheme 2) with diethyl ether. The lipase biocatalyst remained suspended in the ionic liquid phase and could be recycled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">113</ref> A loss of activity was observed, which was ascribed to the accumulation of inhibiting acetaldehyde oligomers in the ionic liquid phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">205</ref> In [BMMIm][BF4], polymer formation did not take place, presumably because the slightly acidic position at C-2 in the imidazolium ring is blocked. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">111</ref> The ionic liquid phase containing the biocatalyst could now be recycled five times without significant activity loss.</p><p>PcL has been entrapped in an ionic solid through dispersion in the relatively high-melting ionic liquid [PhPMIm]-[PF 6 ], which was allowed to solidify and was broken into small particles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">137</ref> The resulting biocatalyst could be reused at least five times in transesterification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Product Evaporation</head><p>Because ionic liquids lack a vapor pressure, products can be removed by evaporation, as was demonstrated in the reduction of prochiral ketones by baker's yeast in [BMIm]-[PF 6 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">166</ref> Evaporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">188,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b234">218</ref> and pervaporation <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">116</ref> of water have been used to shift esterification and amide formation equilibria toward higher conversion.</p><p>Evaporation of the alcohol side-product in lipase-catalyzed transesterification reactions can be used to drive the equilibrium toward complete conversion. Thus, in the transesterification of 30, the usual vinyl ester can be replaced by a methyl one (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_41">36</ref>). Because the latter procedure does not liberate inhibiting acetaldehyde, the biocatalyst could be recycled without deactivation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">205</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Two-Phase Systems with Supercritical CO 2</head><p>The above-mentioned approach of retaining the biocatalyst in the ionic liquid reaction medium has been further developed into a biphasic reaction system.

The high operational stability of CaLB, which contrasts with the generally rapid deactivation in pure scCO 2 , is one of the attractive aspects of this approach. The reaction rate was approximately eight times better than that in pure scCO 2 under otherwise identical conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">162</ref> The continuous reaction system could be combined with in-situ racemization, catalyzed by a solid acid, of the slowreacting enantiomer of 21. <ref type="bibr" target="#b250">235</ref> The racemization catalyst and the lipase (Novozym 435) were coated with ionic liquid and kept physically separate in the reaction vessel.

As demonstrated, lipase-facilitated membrane transport involves two liquid phases that both contain an enzyme and are separated by the membrane. Esterification takes place in the feed phase, and the ester diffuses through the membrane and is hydrolyzed in the receiving phase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b253">238,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">239</ref> The methodology has been applied to the resolution of ibuprofen <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">239</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_42">37</ref>) and in the transport of various arylalkylcarboxylic acids.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusions</head><p>A large variety of enzymes tolerate aqueous-ionic liquid mixtures as the reaction medium. There is hardly an ionic liquid that is not tolerated by any enzyme, and the impression is that ionic liquids are generally tolerated to higher concentrations than water-miscible molecular solvents.</p><p>Many hydrolases, particularly those that tolerate conventional organic solvents, are eminently capable of performing nonhydrolytic reactions in ionic liquids. Activities are generally comparable with or higher than those observed in conventional organic solvents. Furthermore, enhanced thermal and operational stabilities and regio-or enantioselectivities have been observed in many cases. Enzyme-compatible ionic liquids generally do not interact strongly with the enzyme or cause the latter to dissolve. A notable exception to this latter rule is an ionic liquid that passed the ultimate enzyme compatibility test by dissolving enzymes while their activity is maintained. There is, as yet, no theoretical basis for predicting the compatibility of ionic liquids, aqueous or anhydrous, and enzymes, but we expect that the intensity of the interest in the subject will cause one to be developed soon.</p><p>Ionic liquids have obvious potential as reaction media for biotransformations of highly polar substrates, such as (poly)saccharides, which cannot be performed in water, owing to equilibrium limitations. Such replacement of volatile media by nonvolatile ionic liquids will doubtlessly continue, will gradually be adopted by the chemical industry, and will contribute to the efficiency of the latter. The development of less expensive ionic liquids will also further stimulate their use in industrial biotransformations.</p><p>A much more fundamental contribution to the greening of industrial biocatalysis is to be expected from innovative reaction methodologies, downstream processing, and biocatalyst recycling, based on the unique solvent properties of ionic liquids and combinations of ionic liquids and supercritial carbon dioxide. Furthermore, it is to be expected that ionic liquid-based solvent systems will have enormous potential in multicatalyst transformations. Work toward these ends has only just started.</p><p>We confidently expect that green and biocompatible ionic liquids will become available soon, as is absolutely required for ionic liquids to contribute to a greener chemical industry. In short, we believe that biotransformations in ionic liquids hold much promise for the future.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">239</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
