  "summary": "Biocatalysis in ionic liquids has been studied for over two decades, with early work focusing on imidazolium and pyridinium cations, but recent attention is shifting to new structural types. The use of ionic liquids aims to replace volatile organic solvents, offering unique solvent properties that enhance enzyme activity and selectivity.",

  "_abstract": "Fred van Rantwijk (1943) studied organic chemistry at the Delft University of Technology, where he remained as a staff member. He received his Ph.D. in 1980, for work under the guidance of Professor H. van Bekkum. Since the late 1980s he has been working on the application of enzymes in organic synthesis. His particular research interests are the use of enzymes in nonnatural reactions and nonnatural media, enzyme immobilization, and transformations using multi-enzyme systems. Roger Sheldon (1942) received a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Leicester (U.K."
