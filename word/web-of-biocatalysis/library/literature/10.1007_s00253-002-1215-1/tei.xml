<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>An NaCl-independent stability-enhanced mutant of glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) was obtained by using in vitro directed evolution. The family shuffling method was applied for in vitro directed evolution to construct a mutant library of GlcDH genes. Three GlcDHcoding genes from Bacillus licheniformis IFO 12200, Bacillus megaterium IFO 15308 and Bacillus subtilis IFO 13719 were each cloned by direct PCR amplification into the pTrc99A expression vector and expressed in the host, Escherichia coli. In addition to these three GlcDH genes, a gene encoding a previously obtained GlcDH mutant, F20 (Q252L), derived from B. megaterium IWG3, was also subjected to directed evolution by the family shuffling method. A highly thermostable mutant, GlcDH DN-46, was isolated in the presence or absence of NaCl after the second round of family shuffling and filter-based screening of the mutant libraries. This mutant had only one novel additional amino acid residue exchange (E170K) compared to F20, even though DN-46 was obtained by family shuffling of four different GlcDH genes. The effect of temperature and pH on the stability of the GlcDH mutants F20 and DN46 was investigated with purified enzymes in the presence or absence of NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, F20 showed very poor thermostability (half-life =1.3 min at 66C), while the half-life of isolated mutant DN-46 was 540 min at 66C, i.e., 415fold more thermostable than mutant F20. The activity of the wild-type and F20 enzymes dropped critically when the pH value was changed to the alkaline range in the absence of NaCl, but no such decrease was apparent with the DN-46 enzyme in the absence of NaCl.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Glucose dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr">(GlcDH,</ref><ref type="bibr">E.C. 1.1.1.47)</ref> from Bacillus megaterium IWG3, a tetrameric enzyme with four identical subunits (28.24 kDa), catalyzes the oxidation of d-glucose to d-glucono-d-lactone with concomitant reduction of NAD + or NADP + <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Jany et al. 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr">Makino et al. 1989</ref>) and is a member of the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Jörnvall et al. 1995)</ref>. A distinguishable feature of this enzyme is the dissociation of the tetramer into inactive monomers when the pH becomes alkaline; monomers can be reversibly reassembled into the fully active tetramer when the pH value is lowered to 6.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pauly and Pfleiderer 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maurer and</ref><ref type="bibr">Pfleiderer 1985, 1987)</ref>. The addition of 2 M NaCl prevents this alkaline dissociation, thereby stabilizing the oligomeric structure of the tetramer. GlcDH is of interest for the quantitative determination of glucose in blood or other fluids by a single-step assay, and is thus applied in clinical tests and in the food industry. GlcDH is also useful for the enzymatic synthesis of such chiral compounds as ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate and ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, in which GlcDH from B. megaterium has been successfully used as a cofactor (NAD + ) regenerator <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kataoka et al. 1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Kataoka et al. , 1999;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kizaki et al. 2001</ref>). Thus, considerable efforts have been made to enhance the stability of GlcDH <ref type="bibr">(Makino et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nagao et al. 1989)</ref>. It has been shown in these studies that the substitution of one amino acid in GlcDH mutants obtained by random chemical mutagenesis could stabilize them against thermal inactivation. The substitution of Glu-96 by Gly (E96G) or Ala (E96A) prevented alkaline dissociation of the oligomeric active tetramer. These mutants thereby showed thermal stability even in the alkaline pH range without NaCl. Notwithstanding the increased stability of these mutants in the absence of NaCl, the stabilization of these mutants was compromised by a loss of catalytic activity to about half that of native GlcDH (77 or 90 U/mg vs 179 U/mg). While mutant F20, in which Gln-252 was replaced by Leu (Q252L), exhibited improved thermostability without compromising its catalytic activity (170 U/mg), it was still easily inactivated by a thermal treatment and also in an alkaline solution in the absence of NaCl <ref type="bibr">(Makino et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nagao et al. 1989)</ref>. The lack of stability of this mutant against a low NaCl concentration has to date been considered a major drawback to its diagnostic use.</p><p>The directed evolution method has been proven to be a much more powerful protein engineering tool than conventional rational or random chemical mutagenic approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Stemmer 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gonzalez-Blasco et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Song and Rhee 2000)</ref> and has frequently been used to develop enzymes for such purposes as developing thermostability, substrate specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Iffland et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Suenaga et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Meyer et al. 2002)</ref> and organic solvent tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Moore and Arnold 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">You and Arnold 1996)</ref>. This approach could overcome unexpected side effects on the structure and function of the target protein that may result from rational design, and can thus be applied to finding novel mutants.</p><p>In the study presented here, we used the directed evolution method to obtain an improved-stability GlcDH mutant that was stable regardless of the presence or absence of NaCl. GlcDH genes were collected by PCR amplification from Bacillus species, and a chimera library was constructed by the family shuffling method. The improved-stability GlcDH mutant was obtained from the constructed library by the filter-based screening procedure and analyzed for its stability in the presence or absence of NaCl.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bacterial strains, plasmids and medium</head><p>Bacillus licheniformis IFO12200, B. megaterium IFO 15308, and Bacillus subtilis IFO 13719 were obtained from our culture collection (<ref type="url" target="http://www.mbio.co.jp/mbic/">http://www.mbio.co.jp/mbic/</ref>). Escherichia coli JM109 (endA1, recA1,gyrA96, thi, hsdR17, (r k , m k + ), recA1, supE44, l , D(lac-proAB), [F', traD36, proAB, lacI q ZDM15]) was used as the host strain for expression and screening of the mutant GlcDH libraries. Plasmid pGDA3 encoding B. megaterium IWG3 mutant F20 (Q252L) was generously supplied by Amano Pharmaceutical (Nagoya, Japan). Plasmid pTrc99A was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). All restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan) and NAD + was purchased from Oriental Yeast (Osaka, Japan), all other chemicals being purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). The recombinant strains were grown in a Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium chloride), 100 mg ml 1 ampicillin as an antibiotic being added to the medium.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cloning of the GlcDH genes</head><p>Basic DNA manipulation followed the standard methods described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sambrook et al. (1989)</ref>. B. licheniformis IFO 12200, B. megaterium IFO 15308 and B. subtilis IFO 13719 were each grown overnight while shaking in 2 ml nutrient medium (Difco) at 37C. Genomic DNA of the strains isolated from these cultures, and GlcDH genes of these strains were PCR amplified with the oligonucleotide primer pairs shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Each primer was designed according to previously published data to anneal to the Nor C-terminus of each GlcDH gene, and contained NcoI and SalI restriction sites that allowed these genes or shuffled genes to be inserted into expression vector pTrc99A. PCR was performed by 25 cycles of 1 min at 95C, 30 s at 55C and 2 min at 72C. The amplified 0.79 kb DNA fragments were retrieved by a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen), after running electrophoresis on an agarose gel (0.8%), and cloned into the pT7Blue blunt cloning vector (Perfectly Blunt Cloning kit, Novagen). Since plasmid pGDA3 containing an 0.78 kb fragment of the GlcDH mutant F20 (Q252L) from B. megaterium IWG3 was under the control of the tac promoter in the pKK223 vector, this GlcDH mutant gene was also amplified with oligonucleotide primer pairs designed against its N-and C-terminal sequences with the NcoI and SalI restriction sites (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), and cloned into the pT7Blue blunt cloning vector. All resulting plasmids were digested by NcoI and SalI endonucleases to generate cohesive ends and GlcDH fragments were inserted into the pTrc99A expression vector under the control of the trc promoter. The resulting plasmid vectors, pGtrc-9L, pGtrc-9M, pGtrc-9S and pGtrc-9G, were used for further expression and family shuffling to produce mutant GlcDH libraries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nucleotide sequence analysis</head><p>Nucleotide sequences were determined via a dye terminator cyclesequencing reaction following the supplier's instructions (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing products were detected with a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems), and the sequence data were analyzed by the GENETYX-MAC software package (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Family shuffling of the GlcDH genes</head><p>In vitro family shuffling of three wild-type genes and one mutant GlcDH gene was performed according to the method described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Crameri et al. (1998)</ref>. Plasmid DNAs (2.5 mg each of pGtrc-9L, pGtrc-9M, pGtrc-9S and pGtrc-9G) were dissolved together in 5 ml sterile TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The mixture was then treated with DNase I (Takara) for fragmentation in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mM MnCl 2 and 25 mM MgSO 4 (20C, 10 min). After inactivating DNase I by heating at 90C for 10 min, the resulting DNA fragments were purified in a Centricep column (Princeton Separation, Adelphia, N.J.). The purified DNA fragments were then subjected to 40 cycles of the first PCR reaction without any oligonucleotide primers under the following conditions: 1 min at 94C, 1 min at 56C and 1 min +5 s/ cycle at 72C. This PCR reaction was conducted in a total volume of 50 ml using pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in the supplied buffer with a PTC-150 DNA thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, Mass.). In order to amplify the chimeric GlcDH genes, a second PCR reaction was performed for 30 cycles under the following conditions with a set of primers located in the promoter and terminator regions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>): 30 s at 94C, 30 s at 56C and 45+20 s/cycle at 72C. The PCR reaction was performed with 2 ml of the first PCR product as the template and 5 U Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Takara) with the supplied buffer in a total volume of 50 ml. All PCR reactions in this study were performed after denaturing at 96C for 2 min.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening of the mutant libraries</head><p>The shuffled genes were cloned into the NcoI-SalI restriction site of pTrc99A, and a chimeric library was constructed by transforming E. coli JM109. The library was screened by the filter-based system described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nagao et al. (1989)</ref> with slight modification to provide more stringent screening. Colonies in the chimeric library were transferred to sterilized filter papers and lysed by spraying with 1 mg ml 1 lysozyme in 10 mM Tris-HCl and leaving for 30 min at room temperature. The filter papers were then incubated in a prewarmed 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 70C for 1 h. Positive clones exhibiting residual GlcDH activity were detected by color development in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 M d-glucose, 0.5 mM 3-(4', 5'-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 0.5 mM 5-ethylphenazinium ethylsulfate, and 50 mM NAD + at room temperature. Those clones showing residual activity were selected from the original agar plates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purification of GlcDH</head><p>E. coli JM109 harboring each GlcDH was grown on LB medium (2 l) containing 100 mg ml 1 ampicillin. GlcDH was induced by aseptically inoculating with 1 mM isopropyl-b-d ()-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) after 3 h. The cells were washed twice with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and resuspended in the same buffer (20 ml). Sonification was used to lyse the cells on ice (180 s, 50% duty ratio, power rating 7, Branson 250 sonifier). The cell debris was discarded by centrifugation (3,000 g, 1 h), and the resulting supernatant containing GlcDH was heated three times for 20 min at 60C to remove heat-labile protein from the cell-free extract. The aggregates resulting from heat denaturation were separated by centrifugation (25,000 g, 1 h) and discarded. The cellfree extract obtained was diluted 10-fold in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and loaded into a high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) equipped with a DEAE-5PW anionexchange column (21.5 mm ID 15 cm; Tosoh, Japan) with a flow rate of 5 ml min 1 . The protein was washed with the same phosphate buffer and eluted with a 13-25% NaCl gradient. The homogeneity of the purified GlcDH enzyme was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide slab gel, 1 mm thick) by the method of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Laemmli (1970)</ref>. The protein band was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purified GlcDH was washed with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) to remove any remaining NaCl by repeated dilution and concentration through a membrane filter (Amicon).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Enzyme assays</head><p>The assays were conducted in triplicate in the absence or presence of 2 M NaCl. The GlcDH activity of the crude or purified enzyme was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the rate of NADH formation at 340 nm in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 25C with 0.1 M d-glucose and 0.5 M NAD + , and is defined as the enzyme quantity producing 1 mol NADH per minute (a molar absorption coefficient of 6,200 M 1 cm 1 ). The protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Wiechelman et al. 1988</ref>) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the GlcDHs</head><p>The thermal stability of the GlcDHs was determined in triplicate in the absence or presence of 2 M NaCl. Each of the purified GlcDHs (100 mg ml 1 ) was incubated at a temperature between 30 and 80C for 20 min and then cooled on ice. The residual activity was measured at 25C, after diluting the enzyme with 50 mM phosphate buffer. To investigate the thermal stability of each GlcDH, the enzyme was also incubated until no enzyme activity could be detected at a temperature between 30 and 80C. The residual enzyme activity was evaluated after each hour of incubation. The pH stability was evaluated by incubating each of the purified GlcDHs (100 mg ml 1 ) in a buffer solution at a pH between 4 and 10.5 for 20 min, before measuring the residual activity by the method already described.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Cloning of the GlcDH genes Three GlcDH genes were cloned from the Bacillus species, B. licheniformis IFO 12200, B. megaterium IFO 15308 and B. subtilis IFO 13719, by the PCR method, using their genomic DNAs as templates. The primers were designed according to previously published data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and amplified 0.79-kb GlcDH fragments. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of each cloned GlcDH revealed the three GlcDHs to have a degree of similarity ranging from 64.5% to 78%. These cloned genes were successfully expressed using E. coli strain JM109 as a host by using the pTrc99A expression vector, and were confirmed as NAD + -dependent GlcDHs. In addition, thermostable GlcDH mutant F20 (Q252L) from B. megaterium IWG3 was also introduced into pTrc99A for family shuffling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Directed evolution and isolation of the improved GlcDH genes</head><p>Family shuffling of the GlcDH genes was carried out as described in Materials and methods. The DNase I concentration was varied from 0.002 U to 0.02 U to optimize the length of the fragmented nucleotide sequences. The DNA produced by fragmentation at a concentration of 0.0056 U DNase I was selected as the most appropriate size (approximately 25-70 bp) for the further assembling reaction and was subsequently subjected to family shuffling. The PCR products finally amplified with pGtrc-9S pTBsU-N 5'-CATGCCATGGCAATGTATCCGGATTTAAAAGG-3' X12370 pTBsU-S 5'-GTCGACGAGCTCTTAACCGCGTCCTGCCTG-3' pGtrc-9L pTBli-N 5'-CATGCCATGGCAATGTATCCAAGTTTAGAGGG-3' U79570 pTBli-S 5'-GTCGACGAGCTCTCACCCTTTTCCCGCTTG-3' pGtrc-9M pTBmM-N 5'-CATGCCATGGCAATGTATACAGATTTAAAAGATAAAG-3' M12276 pTBmM-S 5'-GTCGACGAGCTCTTAGCCTCTTCCTGCTTGG-3' pGtrc-9G pTGDH-N 5'-CATGCCATGGCAATGTATAAAGATTTAGAAGGAAAAGTAG-3' J04805 pTGDH-S 5'-GTCGACGAGCTCTTATCCGCGTCCTGCTTG-3' pK223P 5'-TGTGGAATTGTGAGCGG-3' M77749 pk223T 5'-TTCTGATTTAATCTGTATCAGGC-3' primers pK223P and pK223T (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were cloned into pTrc99A. The mutant library was prepared to give an average of 100 colonies per plate. In order to evaluate the diversity of the mutant library, 20 colonies were randomly selected and their GlcDH sequences analyzed. The resulting frequency of hybrid formation was revealed to be less than 60%. Although the constructed library contained over 40% of unhybridized GlcDHs, these did not affect the screening procedure, since the strict heat treatment conditions used for screening (1 h at 70C; see Materials and methods) ensured no detectable color development from the remaining enzymatic activity of the unhybridized GlcDHs. The three most thermostable GlcDH mutants (DN-21, DN-25 and DN-46) were finally isolated from more than 210 4 colonies in the mutant library after two rounds of family shuffling and screening. The plasmids from the three mutants were then isolated and their sequences analyzed (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Interestingly, the sequences of all the selected mutants still maintained leucine at position 252 from the N-terminus, this being derived from mutant F20, supporting the importance of this amino acid substitution for the stability of GlcDH.</p><p>Although DN-25 did not have any changed amino acid sequences compared to F20, several silent mutations were found (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). We observed that the expression level of DN-25 was significantly increased. It seems that the shuffling procedure changed the nucleotide sequence of DN-25 in a way favoring higher expression of GlcDH in E. coli. The sequences of DN-21 and DN-46 had only one additional amino acid replacement (N192D and E170K, respectively) compared to F20 (Q252L), even though they had 14 and 3 silent replacements, respectively, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Purification of the GlcDH mutants</head><p>The recombinant GlcDH mutants introduced into pTrc99A were highly expressed in E. coli JM109 after being induced by the addition of IPTG without any tag protein. The enzymatic activity was found to be sufficiently stable when the bacterial cells were disrupted by sonification. Anion-exchange chromatography yielded a pure protein with GlcDH activity that migrated at approximately 30 kDa by SDS-PAGE (data not shown), this being consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the recombinant protein produced from wild-type GlcDH and mutant F20.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability of the GlcDH mutants</head><p>The thermal stability was tested by incubating each purified GlcDH mutant in the presence or absence of 2 M NaCl. Among purified DN-21, DN-25 and DN-46, only DN-46 showed thermostability higher than that of F20. We thus further investigated the stability of DN-46. As can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>, the half-life of the DN-46 mutant was 540 min at 66C in the absence of NaCl, this being dramatically greater than the half-life of F20 (1.3 min in the absence of NaCl). Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref> shows the remaining GlcDH activity of thermostable mutants DN-46 and F20 after heat treating for 20 min at different temperatures. DN-46 retained enzyme activity even after being treated at 75C, regardless of NaCl addition. The pH stability was examined by incubating each purified enzyme in buffers of various pH value with or without NaCl. As shown in Fig. 1 Amino acid replacement in the isolated glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) mutants. Thin vertical lines Silent mutations</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>, the GlcDH activity of mutant F20 was not decreased when 2 M NaCl was added to the buffer solution above pH 9. However, F20 absolutely and dramatically lost its enzyme activity in the absence of 2 M NaCl at above pH 9. In contrast, DN-46 did not show significantly decreased enzyme activity in the absence of NaCl at alkaline pH, even though slightly decreased enzyme activity was apparent in the presence of 2 M NaCl.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kinetic analysis of the GlcDH mutants</head><p>The kinetic constants for d-glucose and NAD + were determined from the intercepts of Lineweaver-Burk plots (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The K m value and specificity constant (k cat /K m ) of mutant DN-46 obtained from d-glucose were 8.5 mM and 39 mM 1 s 1 , respectively. These values are almost the same as those of both wild-type GlcDH and mutant F20, confirming that the catalytic efficiency of this protein had not been affected by the mutation. The substrate specificity was also unchanged in DN-46 as shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have described in this report the isolation of GlcDH mutants that exhibited significantly enhanced stability regardless of the presence of NaCl without any loss of catalytic activity. In order to obtain a higher frequency of recombination by family shuffling, we constructed a chimeric library by the family shuffling method with randomly cleaved fragments of four GlcDHs. However, the constructed library did not possess a high crossover rate among the four GlcDH genes by using the DNase I method. This low yield of crossover formation has been frequently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Zhao and Arnold 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Kikuchi et al. 1999)</ref>, and it was noted that the accumulation rate of point mutations was very low. In our analysis, however, most of the shuffled products had an average of eight nucleotide mutations per gene, demonstrating that the mutation rate was very high. It thus seems that this unusually high mutation rate after two rounds of the family shuffling procedure made it possible to isolate significantly improved thermostable mutant DN-46. DN-46, the most stable isolate, had only two amino substitutions -E170K and Q252L -compared to wild type GlcDH from B. megaterium IWG3, in addition to several silent mutations. This isolate had a half-life at 66C that was 415 times longer than that of the previously obtained most thermostable parental enzyme, F20, and this thermostability was not affected by the NaCl concentration. Moreover, DN-46 had almost the same specific activity (172 U mg 1 ) as that of the wild-type enzyme (179 U mg 1 ) and F20 mutant (170 U mg 1 ), indicating no unfavorable effects resulting from the dramatically increased thermostability. This result can be explained by the crystal structure of wild-type GlcDH recently determined with NAD + at a 1.7 resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Yamamoto et al. 2001</ref>).</p><p>According to this three-dimensional structure, the activity site is far from these two mutations, explaining why the catalytic activity in the mutation was not altered by replacing these two amino acids, even with its greatly increased stability. The two changed amino acids, E170K and Q252L, in DN-46 are located at the subunit-subunit interface, which is unusually wide in GlcDH, leading to lower stability than that of other short-chain dehydroge-  Table 3 Substrate specificity of wild type and mutant GlcDH Enzyme Glucose Galactose Xylose Maltose Sucrose Fructose Mannose Wild type 100 1.9 12.6 3.8 n.d. a 1.4 10.4 F20 100 2.8 11.8 n.d. n.d. n.d. 18.3 DN-46 100 2.3 8.2 n.d. n.d. n.d. 13.8 a None detected</p><p>nases and reductases in this family. It should be noted that the stability of oligomeric enzymes is strongly correlated with the amino acid residues found in the subunit-subunit interaction space <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Flores and Ellington 2002)</ref>. We assume from this that the significantly enhanced stability of DN-46 is likely to have been caused by stronger intersubunit interactions. Previous studies have reported that the stability of F20 came from the replacement of Gln-252 with Leu without affecting the amino acid charge <ref type="bibr">(Makino et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nagao et al. 1989)</ref>, suggesting that the thermal stability may have been increased due to the increase in hydrophobic interaction. However, the thermal stability of F20 was critically affected without NaCl (11.7 min at 50C). Moreover, the activities of the wildtype and F20 mutant enzymes dropped sharply when they were incubated at an alkaline pH value in the absence of NaCl, indicating that the fundamental cause of dissociation of the oligomeric tetramer to a monomer in the absence of NaCl was not eliminated by the replacement in F20 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Nagao et al. 1989)</ref>. In contrast, no decrease in activity in the alkaline pH range was apparent in DN-46, even in the absence of NaCl. As shown in the threedimensional structure of the wild-type enzyme, Glu-170 may be involved in hydrogen bonding via water molecular with Lys-149 in the subunit-subunit interaction. This water-mediated hydrogen bonding would be disrupted when the pH is shifted to the alkaline range due to the formation of un-ionized (-NH 2 ) Lys-149 above pH 9, resulting in the charged ionic state (-COO ) of Glu-170 between subunits. As a result, the anion-charged side chain of Glu-170 would give rise to a considerable anionanion repulsion effect between subunits unless a high concentration of NaCl exists. This is also consistent with the fact that acid residues are a major factor in the destabilization of proteins under low-salt conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Elcock and McCammon 1998)</ref>. Considering that the DN-46 mutant was stable regardless of the presence of NaCl, this amino acid change (E170K) might have reduced the anion-anion repulsion between subunits so that the subunit-subunit interaction was tighter. It should therefore be noted that the significantly enhanced thermal and alkaline pH stability of DN-46 was the result of a cooperative effect of the two different stabilization mechanisms, i.e., the formation of hydrophobic interaction by the Q252L substitution and the reduction of anionanion repulsion by E170K. Further studies based on sitedirected mutagenesis and the three-dimensional structure will elucidate the role of each mutation in the significantly enhanced thermal stability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2A ,Fig. 1</head><label>2A1</label><figDesc>Fig. 2A, B Thermal stability of isolated mutant DN-46.
