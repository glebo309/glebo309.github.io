<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>ABSTRACT: Biocatalysis, using defined enzymes for organic transformations, has become a common tool in organic synthesis, which is also frequently applied in industry. The generally high activity and outstanding stereo-, regio-, and chemoselectivity observed in many biotransformations are the result of a precise control of the reaction in the active site of the biocatalyst. This control is achieved by exact positioning of the reagents relative to each other in a fine-tuned 3D environment, by specific activating interactions between reagents and the protein, and by subtle movements of the catalyst. Enzyme engineering enables one to adapt the catalyst to the desired reaction and process. A well-filled biocatalytic toolbox is ready to be used for various reactions. Providing nonnatural reagents and conditions and evolving biocatalysts enables one to play with the myriad of options for creating novel transformations and thereby opening new, short pathways to desired target molecules. Combining several biocatalysts in one pot to perform several reactions concurrently increases the efficiency of biocatalysis even further.</p><p>■ NEED FOR A BROAD TOOLBOX OF (CHIRAL)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CATALYSTS FOR ORGANIC SYNTHESIS</head><p>Over almost two centuries, starting with Friedrich Woḧler, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> researchers have developed synthetic methods to prepare various natural products and derivatives thereof as well as completely new molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Consequently, organic synthesis has become a highly powerful art providing versatile protocols to prepare molecules of and for our life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> Thus organic synthesis provides access to chemical compounds that cover our daily needs with respect to virtually every aspect of modern life, including clothing, hygiene, nutrition, transport, housing, and health.</p><p>Without doubt, organic synthesis has a major impact on our standard of living. Nevertheless, the economic, environmental, and social concerns of our society still urge chemistry to make synthetic routes even more efficient, more easily scalable, and more cost-effective. Ideally, chemical products should be accessible and affordable for all human beings, and their manufacture should allow the current state of the environment to be preserved or even improved. This goes in hand with and is part of the 12 principles of "Green Chemistry". <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref> Just recently, in 2018, K. C. Nicolaou requested improvements for organic synthesis, envisioning nature's efficiency as an ideal goal:</p><p>"It is also important to re-emphasize that organic synthesis still has a long way to go before it can be considered competitive with biosynthesis, Nature's way of making molecules. The standards of Nature (i. e., close to 100 % yield, little if any waste, ambient temperature, aqueous media) should be those we must seek in our drive to perfect our synthetic capabilities in order to enable the myriad of imaginable and unimaginable applications of organic synthesis of today and tomorrow." <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> Actually, in the "Organic Chemist's Ode", the power of nature's synthesis sounds unreachable:</p><p>"Lord, I fall upon my knees / And pray that all my syntheses / May no longer be inferior / To those conducted by bacteria" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> We know that the natural catalysts, the enzymes present in all living beings, are responsible for these reactions. If these enzymes are so efficient, then is it not obvious that we should utilize them in organic synthesis? Why try to compete if there is the option to use them, learn how their mechanistic machinery works, and consequently tune and exploit them for different substrates? This is, of course, not a new idea, and about the last 25 years have initiated a slow change of paradigm in synthetic chemistry to incorporate some selected enzymes in the repertoire of catalysis. Enzymes, made up of a chain of L-α-amino acids, may be considered as huge organocatalysts if there is no metal involved or as organometallic catalysts with a huge ligand in case a metal is involved. The enzymes used today in synthesis are typically composed of a peptide chain of 200-600 amino acids, consequently possessing a molecular weight between 20 and 60 kDa. If metals are present, then these usually have a high natural abundance and low toxicity, such as iron, copper, manganese, zinc, magnesium, cobalt, or molybdenum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> The outstanding properties of nature's catalysts were already exploited in chemical synthetic routes about 100 years ago, at a time when nothing was known about the structure of these catalysts or even their amino acid sequence. At this time, the whole (living) organism was employed as a black box catalyst for a single chemical step without knowing what was going on inside. For instance, a bacterium named Acetobacter suboxydans was used for the regio-and chemoselective oxidation of a single sec-alcohol moiety in D-sorbitol in the neighborhood of three more sec-OHs and two primary OHs to give the corresponding ketone, L-sorbose (Scheme 1a). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref> This microbial oxidation step is part of a reaction sequence involving several chemical steps starting from D-glucose and leading to vitamin C. This overall process is basically still used today on an industrial scale, albeit with some improvements.</p><p>A stereoselective benzoin reaction has been the asymmetric key step in the industrial synthesis of (-)-ephedrine since 1921 until today, originally performed using living cells of baker's yeast (Scheme 1b). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> Thereby, a new C-C bond is formed between benzaldehyde and decarboxylated pyruvate, giving (R)phenylacetyl carbinol ((R)-PAC) as the key intermediate.</p><p>A regio-and stereoselective C-H oxidation accomplished by a fungus (e.g., Rhizopus; Scheme 1c) <ref type="bibr">25</ref> is part of the large-scale synthesis of hydrocortisone, an important anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of debilitating diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. These three examples nicely illustrate the exquisite regio-, chemo-, and stereoselectivity of enzymes. Just to also show an example for a bulk chemical, the production of acrylamide by the monohydration of acrylonitrile on a &gt; 50 000 tons per year scale is one of the most impressive industrial applications of enzymes, reaching the productivity levels of heterogeneous catalysts (Scheme 1d; space-time yields 53-93 g L -1 h -1 ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> The advantage of the last reaction over the chemical alternative is its high chemoselectivity, exclusively giving the amide, as well as the easier separation of the catalyst from the product compared with metal catalysts. Various other examples throughout the history of biocatalysis have been reviewed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ■ ENZYMES AS AN EXTENSION OF THE TOOLBOX OF CATALYSTS Transformations using living bacterial or fungal strains may have had the flavor of a nonscientific method for an organic chemist, who would have wanted to precisely describe the mechanism of the reaction and wanted to know the molecular structure of the catalyst. Fortunately, the specific enzymes responsible for catalyzing the reactions above have been identified in the meantime. Thus light was brought into the darkness of the black a (a) Vitamin C, (b) (-)-ephedrine, (c) hydrocortisone, and (d) acrylamide.</p><p>box, and we know what the catalysts are. Over the last several decades, many enzymes in biosynthetic pathways have been identified, and their 3D structures have been solved and deposited in databases like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> which currently contains more than 160 000 structures and grows by more than 10 000 entries every year. Thus the enzymes are available and awaiting their exploitation. Thanks to cocrystallization or soaking of the proteins with substrates/ products, crystal structures were obtained, showing the binding modes of the substrate/product in the catalyst, which is rarely possible with organo-or organometallic catalysts. Such protein structures containing the substrate/product help us to understand the mechanism as well as the reactivity and stereo-and regioselectivity of enzymes. Alternatively, computational tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> for modeling of enzyme structures and the mode of substrate binding support the elucidation of mechanisms and the understanding of these biocatalysts.</p><p>With the growing understanding of the structure and function followed by searching for applications, the need to produce the biocatalyst outside of its natural source organism arose. In this context, three practical aspects are worth mentioning: First, the preparation of the catalyst requires, in general, the machinery of the protein synthesis of microorganisms via fermentation, which ultimately consumes nutrients such as sugars and amino acids. Thus it relies on renewable resources. Second, the production of a new batch happens, in general, within a few hours, maybe up to a few days, in one process step; thus it is relatively quick in comparison with, for example, multistep syntheses of nonnatural ligands. Third, because the biocatalyst is made of amino acids, it is also naturally degradable; one might even eat it. This clearly underlines that such catalysts can be easily integrated in a circular economy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> The term biocatalyst is very often used, and unfortunately, this term is rather imprecise, as it is employed, for example, for a wild-type organism, a single enzyme, a crude enzyme preparation, or an enzyme (preparation) immobilized on a carrier. Most often, the term biocatalyst refers to a crude cell extract from the production strain (e.g., E. coli), which may contain many other enzymes that, in general, do not interfere with the intended reaction. Enzyme purification by chromatography is prohibitively expensive on a large scale, explaining the prevalence of crude preparations provided by commercial sources. However, certain production strains (e.g., Komagataella phaff ii, previously known as Pichia pastoris) allow the secretion of enzymes into the aqueous medium in which the production strain grows, making separation straightforward and leading right away to a rather pure enzyme preparation. Actually, for example, when produced in E. coli, even the whole cells containing the heterologously expressed enzyme may be used as catalyst preparation. When we speak in the following about a "biocatalyst", this refers to a single enzyme, which may be used in purified form, as a crude preparation, or immobilized on a carrier.</p><p>Consequently, the word biocatalysis is also used for many approaches. For this outlook in connection to organic synthesis, we consider biocatalysis as the use of either a single enzyme (also when provided as crude preparation) or combinations of different enzymes in one pot for the transformation of any welldefined organic compound; thus we do not deal with living organisms here. Living organisms present additional challenges for biotechnologists because they contain thousands of enzymes and countless metabolites at changing concentrations within a cell. For organic chemistry, we prefer a simpler, more defined system. Biocatalysis in this sense of the word enables the sustainable production of chemicals by catalyzing specific steps while avoiding the restrictions associated with microbial strains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> ■ HIGH-TECH FEATURES OF A BIOCATALYST In the early days of biocatalysis, it was assumed that the acceleration of the reaction rate achieved by enzymes is mainly due to the stabilization of transition states. However, this view was falsified when the performance of antibodies that possess an ideal complement structure to the transition state was clearly inferior to that of enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> It turned out that efficient catalysis requires more than just transition-state stabilization. Following an enzymatic catalytic cycle in detail, one notices that in an ideal case, each step is controlled by several interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. The main steps of a general catalytic cycle are (i) binding of substrate(s), (ii) activation of substrate(s), (iii) stabilization of transition state(s), and (iv) product release (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The substrate binding relies on not just one or two interactions between the enzyme and the substrate (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) but several, which are required for the precise positioning of the reaction partners to each other in 3D space in a productive pose. The interaction between the substrate and the biocatalyst at (at least) three points is also important for the differentiation between enantiomers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> One might argue that a significant contribution to the efficiency of enzymes is the controlled precise orientation of the reactants in space, in addition to the strategically ideal location of various catalytically active residues. Thus several residues usually contribute to enabling the reaction; this well-established concept in enzymes has recently been described as synergistic catalysis. <ref type="bibr">40</ref> The residues catalyzing the reaction or binding the substrate shape the active site of the catalyst, providing the To expel the product quickly after the reaction is important to minimize product inhibition. This is easier the more the substrate and the product differ from each other confinement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41</ref> Nevertheless, for an enzyme, this shape is adapting in size to the substrate; the enzyme backbone is flexible/dynamic during the catalytic cycle, adapting for ideal positions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref> Thus the conformational dynamics also influenced by allosteric regulation (i.e., tuning enzyme function by distal positions) play a crucial role in the substrate binding as well as for product release. In comparison, a heterogeneous catalyst like a zeolite will absorb a substrate so that it is completely surrounded by the rigid structure of the zeolite. An organocatalyst is more flexible but can control only a limited number of degrees of freedom of the substrate due to its smaller size. The enzyme combines the best from both, the pocket formation and flexibility, which are considered important for substrate binding and catalytic turnover. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49</ref> Furthermore, whereas a low-molecular-weight organocatalyst is, in general, not controlling the approach of the substrate to the catalytically active residue, and the zeolite is differentiating mainly by size, the flexible loops and domains of a biocatalyst gate the access of the substrate to the active site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51</ref> In Scheme 2a, the important features of an enzyme contributing to the different steps are exemplified for an enzyme enabling a C-C bond formation, namely, the acylation of resorcinol. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[58]</ref> The natural reaction of this acyltransferase is the disproportionation of monoacetyl-phloroglucinol (Scheme 2b); <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">60</ref> however, it turned out that the natural catalyst shows promiscuous activity to also accept esters (e.g., phenyl or vinyl) as acyl donors and to link the acyl group to (substituted) resorcinol via the formation of a new C-C bond. This is remarkable because O-acylation occurs under chemical catalysis. To ensure this chemoselectivity, precise binding is required.</p><p>Looking at the structure of the catalyst, one can differentiate between certain regions of the enzyme (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): Obviously, the most important one is the place where the reaction occurs, the active site. Often, a tunnel, maybe via a gate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50</ref> leading to the active site preselects and preorientates the substrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">62</ref> There might be several tunnels to the active site, for example, one for bigger molecules and another for smaller molecules. The active-site pocket accommodates the catalytically active residues, whereof one residue may bind the substrate covalently. (In the example, a cysteine, Cys88, forms a reactive thioester intermediate; this covalent interaction may also occur with a cofactor.) Other residues contribute to substrate activation and its correct positioning in the active site (e.g., His56 and Tyr124 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> in addition to others not highlighted).</p><p>Alternatively, cofactors extending the repertoire of catalysis may be accommodated in the active site, enabling reductions/ oxidations via hydride transfer (NAD(P) + /NAD(P)H, flavins) or, for example, oxygenation (iron bound either in porphyrin or directly to the enzyme), methyl transfer, or methyl shuttling (Sadenosyl methionine or cobalamin) and various others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[65]</ref> The amino acid side chains are oriented by the folding of the protein and fine-positioned by the residues surrounding them. Consequently, not only the residues in the active site but also those in the next outer shell contribute to the 3D structure of the active site. Countless interactions within the densely packed protein core, together with conformational restrictions of the peptide backbone, lead to a defined but flexible arrangement of the active-site residues.</p><p>The outermost layer is responsible for the contact with the medium and, in some cases, for enabling the formation of dimers or even oligomers of the catalyst. In summary, the large molecular size of enzymes in combination with numerous intramolecular interactions leads to a 3D structure that is welldefined but also dynamic, thereby meeting the requirements of substrate binding and catalysis. Unfortunately, protein dynamics may also lead to conformational states that trigger unfolding and therefore loss of activity. Indeed, enzyme stability, for example, toward elevated temperatures, cosolvent concentrations, or substrate concentrations, may be an issue for certain biocatalysts. Nevertheless, it has been shown that enzymes can be stabilized by various approaches, such as ancestral sequence reconstruction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">66</ref> enzyme engineering, including the introduction of salt bridges <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">68</ref> and disulfide bonds, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[72]</ref> or glycosylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">73</ref> The above example gives a glimpse of the complexity of enzymes as catalysts and shows that there are many screws to turn.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A SPECIFIC REACTION</head><p>If anybody wants a catalyst that has a universal substrate scope and, at the same time, an outstanding selectivity (e.g., stereoselectivity), then one should note that this is a contradiction. The higher the selectivity, the narrower the substrate scope must be. On the contrary, the broader the substrate scope, the lower the selectivity. Considering stereoselectivity, optical purities above 99% e.e. (equals an e.r. of 99.5 to 0.5) are the ones of interest due to legal requirements in the pharma industry. Calculating the difference in transition-state energies required to differentiate between the two enantiomers, one will learn that the ΔΔG needed to get from 0 to 95% e.e. (e.r. of 97.5:2.5) is approximately equal to the ΔΔG to get from 95 to 99.9% e.e. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">74</ref> In other words, reaching an e.e. of 95% is half the effort compared with the one to get to 99% optical purity. To achieve this stereoselectivity, the interplay of all features of an enzyme mentioned above are required, which consequently leads to a specific catalyst.</p><p>To achieve both an excellent selectivity and a broad substrate scope, modern biocatalysis relies on libraries of enzymes, similar to the catalyst libraries used in organo-and organometallic catalysis.

This intrinsic compatibility makes combining biocatalysts in one pot to perform several reactions concurrently in a cascade a highly appealing option.

The most active enzymes for the individual steps were selected from screenings and optimized using directed evolution methods to catalyze the desired reaction. The reaction sequence starts with a desymmetrization via the oxidation of 2-ethynylglycerol by a galactose oxidase variant, supported by a catalase and a horseradish peroxidase for the decomposition of reactive oxygen species. This is followed by phosphorylation employing a pantothenate kinase variant, supported by an acetate kinase for ATP recycling, to yield a phosphorylated aldehyde intermediate (Scheme 7b). All following steps are performed simultaneously to shift unfavorable equilibria. The phosphorylated aldehyde is coupled to acetaldehyde in an aldol reaction, catalyzed by a deoxyribose 5phosphate aldolase, forming the non-natural sugar scaffold. After shifting a phosphate group from position 5 to 1 by a phosphate transferase, the target API islatravir is finally assembled by a purine nucleoside phosphorylase. In the last step, a sucrose phosphorylase helps to shift the reaction equilibrium toward the nucleoside product by removing the liberated phosphate. Overall, the reaction sequence involves nine enzymes, five of which were engineered in up to 12 rounds of directed evolution. The route produces a single enantiomer of islatravir in 51% overall yield without intermediary workup, showcasing the enormous synthetic potential of enzymatic cascade processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">198</ref> ■ THE FUTURE STARTS NOW The synthetic application of biocatalysts is still a relatively young field of research, and enzymes are complex molecules, so it is fair to admit that there are still many challenges that need to be addressed. One issue is definitely the stability of the catalyst and thus its lifetime and consequently the space-time yields in processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">199</ref> Research to elucidate what makes a protein stable under process conditions is a hot topic and needs to be expanded to make the stabilization of enzymes more straightforward. Further challenges are the costs and the time required for developing a suitable catalyst in the lab, which need to be reduced to allow the fast implementation of enzyme-catalyzed processes in industry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">200</ref> Another important aspect is that biocatalysis needs to be incorporated as part of chemistry curricula at universities to train the chemists of tomorrow in its application and to give them a broader methodological horizon. Future synthetic chemists should be made aware that biocatalysts can be used in single-step transformations or in cascades comprising several biocatalysts or, if suitable, can be incorporated in metabolic pathways of living organisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">201</ref> For a sustainable future, we also have to appreciate that proteins are made up of renewables and are biodegradable, contributing to a much-desired circular economy.</p><p>Although a substantial number of biocatalysts are already described for several synthetically useful reactions (cf. the selection in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), even more extensive libraries of stable, highly active enzymes need to be and will be developed in the future to cover the theoretically possible substrate scope of each reaction. Depending especially on the size but also on the functional groups present in the substrate, the possibly suitable biocatalysts may then be easily identified by comparison with previous results obtained for a specific enzyme. To give everybody easy access to biocatalysts, libraries of well-described enzymes with known sequences may be distributed via institutions, or plasmids encoding these biocatalysts may be deposited and made available in repositories (first examples are available <ref type="bibr">202,</ref><ref type="bibr">203</ref> ) that distribute them for a small fee and with the only requirement of citing the original work.</p><p>Following the current publications, the scope of reactions performed by biocatalysts is also constantly expanding, and much progress can be expected for years to come. In addition to some emerging biocatalysts listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> (performing, e.g., halogenation or amide formation reactions), catalysts for various types of C-C bond formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">204</ref> are needed, with oxidative C-C coupling probably posing the biggest challenge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">205,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b200">206</ref> Biocatalysis needs to be incorporated as part of chemistry curricula at universities to train the chemists of tomorrow in its application and to give them a broader methodological horizon.</p><p>In general, the demands of modern synthesis will require the continued development of novel catalytic methods. Tight reaction control in a confined space has been identified as a key factor in this context, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41</ref> and proteins arguably provide extensive opportunities to achieve this control. Additionally, synergistic catalysis is a key feature of enzymes.</p><p>Therefore, when it comes to reactions requiring high chemo-, regio-, or stereoselectivity, biocatalysts offer a high chance for success. Because of the infinite number of theoretical possibilities for a protein backbone (e.g., for a protein containing 300 amino acids, 20∧300 permutations exist, which is a number bigger than the number of atoms in the universe), the question often is not whether a suitable catalyst is possible but whether it can be identified. The screening of libraries of variants has proven to be a viable approach for discovering new enzymes and improving known ones, but would it not be preferable if we were able to design them? Whether machine learning will become a key technology in this context will be seen in the future, <ref type="bibr" target="#b201">[207]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">[208]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">[209]</ref> but for sure, computational design requires various approaches and methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr">75</ref> Huge efforts have been spent on designing enzymes, and basic research in the years to come will provide new approaches to create highly efficient, stable biocatalysts that are also easy to produce. The past has already indicated the high potential of biocatalysts in organic synthesis, and the present has paved an avenue for exploiting biocatalysts in synthetic routes, tailoring and evolving wild-type enzymes, and creating hybrid catalysts, for example, by incorporating low-molecular-weight catalysts in a protein environment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">173</ref> The future will see both a diversification of available enzymes and the development of novel hybrid catalysts with new-to-nature activities. Consequently, in the future, a biodegradable biocatalyst may be developed/designed for any specific transformation desired and thereby shortcut organic synthetic routes to produce the target molecule in a minimum number of steps ideally requiring only environmentally benign reagents.</p></div>
