<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The stereoselective synthesis of chiral organic compounds is of substantial academic and industrial interest, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> as evidenced inter alia by the Nobel Prize for Chemistry 2001 to K. B. Sharpless, R. Noyori and W. S. Knowles. Although most industrial syntheses of optically pure intermediates still involve classical antipode separation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> asymmetric catalysis can be expected to gain in importance in the future. Chemists have two options, namely chiral synthetic catalysts such as transition metal complexes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> or biocatalysts such as enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In the former case ligand tuning is necessary, which is not a trivial matter. In the case of biocatalysis, many enzymes are commercially available and do in fact work well in catalyzing the enantioselective transformation of a number of (unnatural) compounds. However, the problem of substrate specificity persists, which means that a vast number of substrates are not converted with acceptable degrees of stereoselectivity. In this case site specific mutagenesis can be applied as a type of ligand tuning, but this has not been routinely successful. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> In view of these problems we have applied the methods of directed evolution of functional enzymes to the creation of enantioselective enzymes for use in synthetic organic chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> The starting point is a wild-type enzyme which catalyzes a given reaction of interest, A!B, but not enantioselectively. The gene that encodes the wild-type enzyme is first subjected to random mutagenesis using such molecular biological methods as error prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR), <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">7</ref> saturation mutagenesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref> cassette mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">9</ref> and/or DNA shuffling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref> Upon inserting the library of mutant genes in an appropriate microorganism, mutant enzymes (variants) are expressed which are individually screened for activity and enantioselectivity in the reaction of interest. The mutant gene of the optimal enzyme variant is then subjected once more to mutagenesis/ expression/screening. This creates an evolutionary pressure, leading to the formation and identification of an even better enzyme.

Moreover, we discuss the limits of the method, and show how to overcome them. Specifically, the concept of directed evolution of hybrid catalysts is delineated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Directed evolution of (S )-and (R )-selective lipases starting from a single wild-type</head><p>As a model reaction we initially chose the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of the ester 1, 5 catalyzed by the bacterial lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">17</ref> The selectivity factor, reflecting the relative rate of reaction of the (S )-and (R )-substrate 1, amounts to only E¼1.1 in slight favor of the (S )-acid 2 (Scheme 1).</p><p>The p-nitrophenol and not the methyl ester was chosen because hydrolysis releases p-nitrophenol, a compound that can be monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy at 410 nm. Of course, if the racemate is used in the wells of a 96-format microtiter plate, only total activity but not enantioselectivity would be accessible. Therefore a simple trick was developed, namely the use of (S )-and (R )-1 separately pairwise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5</ref> Thus, 48 enzyme mutants could be screened using a 96-well microtiter plate equipped with a standard plate reader. This rather crude assay allowed about 500 samples to be tested per day. Later more efficient ee-assays were developed for the kinetic resolution of chiral esters and for other types of asymmetric reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">18</ref> We first had to consider the mutation rate, which has to do with the problem of exploring protein sequence space. The lipase from P. aeruginosa has 285 amino acids. Complete randomization would result in 20 285 different enzymevariants, which is more than the mass of the universe, even if only one molecule of each enzyme were to be produced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> The other extreme entails the minimum amount of structural change, namely the substitution of a single amino acid per molecule of enzyme by one of the other 19 naturally occurring amino acids. In this case, on the basis of the algorithm N¼19M£285!/[(2852M )!M!], where M¼ number of amino acid substitutions per enzyme molecule, the library of variants would theoretically have 5415 members. However, when using epPCR as the random mutagenesis method, a library of 5000-6000 members is not expected to contain all theoretically possible permutations. This is because the genetic code is degenerate. If two amino acids are exchanged per enzyme molecule (M¼2), then the number of enzyme-variants increases dramatically (about 14 million!). In the case of M¼3, it is more than 52 billion.</p><p>Therefore a low mutation rate was chosen so as to induce an average of only one amino acid exchange per enzyme molecule. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5</ref> Thus, in the case of the kinetic resolution of the ester 1, epPCR was adjusted to cause about 1 -2 base substitutions per 1000 base pairs of the gene, resulting in an average of one amino acid exchange. Typically, 2000-3000 enzyme-variants per generation were screened. Following expression in E. coli/P. aeruginosa, the screening system based on the UV/Vis absorption of the liberated p-nitrophenolate was employed. As a consequence of the first round of mutagenesis and screening, a variant displaying a selectivity factor of E¼2.1 was identified. The corresponding mutant gene was then subjected once more to mutagenesis, and the process was repeated several times. The result after four generations led to a variant (A) having an E-value of 11.3 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> Although these remarkable results constitute proof of principle, 5 a selectivity factor of 11.3 is not yet practical. Thus, a fifth round of mutagenesis was performed, and indeed the usual library of about 3000 mutants contained several slightly improved variants. In spite of this advancement it became clear that we needed methods which allow for more efficient ways to explore protein sequence space with respect to enantioselectivity. Accordingly, DNAanalyses leading to amino acid sequence determinations of the variants were carried out as a first step. For example, the best mutants of the first four generations turned out to have  1. The process of random mutagenesis/screening identifies sensitive positions ('hot spots') in the enzyme which are responsible for improved enantioselectivity. 2. Such positions are likely to be correct, but the particular amino acid identified may not be optimal. 3. Saturation mutagenesis at the hot spots can be expected to generate improved mutants.</p><p>Saturation mutagenesis is a molecular biological method with which mutations at a given position of an enzyme can be introduced, a small library of only 300 -400 variants being necessary to ensure that all of the remaining 19 amino acids have been introduced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">8</ref> Upon applying this strategy at one of the hot spots (e.g. at position 155), it was discovered that phenylalanine (F) is the best amino acid. Saturation mutagenesis using the best gene in the third generation led to the identification of a variant (B) which showed a selectivity factor of E¼20, phenylalanine again 'showing up' as the best amino acid at position 155. Thereafter, epPCR was applied again, which resulted in E¼25 (variant C). Clearly, the combination of mutagenesis methods, namely epPCR and saturation mutagenesis, constitutes an efficient method to explore protein sequence space with respect to enantioselectivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">20</ref> The best mutant (C) showing an E-value of 25 turned out to have five mutations, namely: <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19</ref> Ser 149 !Gly 149 (S149G</p><p>). Ser 155 !Phe 155 (S155F). Val 47 !Gly 47 (V47G). Ser 164 !Gly 164 (S164G). Val 55 !Gly 55 (V55G).</p><p>Although it has not yet been possible to obtain crystals of this (S )-selective mutant, the X-ray crystal structure of the wild-type lipase from P. aeruginosa was determined recently by Dijkstra. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21</ref> It is depicted here in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> together with the five points of mutations (hot spots as shown in yellow) introduced successively as described above. The active site is the hydroxy function of serine shown in blue, which is part of the usual catalytically active triad of a lipase composed of serine, histidine and aspartate. At serine a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed. Surprisingly, the hot spots are not really close to the active site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">20</ref> Remote effects have been uncovered in other cases regarding activity and stability of mutant enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">21</ref> However, this is the first case of remote effects influencing the enantioselectivity of an enzyme. All previous attempts to enhance enantioselectivity on a rational basis by applying site specific mutagenesis have focused on amino acid substitutions close to the active site, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> keeping Emil Fischer's principle of 'lock and key' or Koshland's improved model based on 'induced fit' in mind. Thus, the present results may appear to be a serious contradiction. However, this is not the case. The picture in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> is static in nature and therefore does not reflect the true structure of the mutant enzyme. Indeed, molecular modeling suggests that the specific amino acid substitutions at remote positions cause the enzyme to take on a slightly different shape which induces higher enantioselectivity. It is also conspicuous that glycine is introduced several times, which can be expected to increase the conformational flexibility of the enzyme.</p><p>Although an E-factor of 25 begins to have practical value, it was important to continue to explore protein sequence space with respect to enantioselectivity using other mutagenesis methods. For example, the question arose as to the mutation rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> Would it make sense to repeat the project using a relative high epPCR-based mutation rate corresponding to an average of three mutations per enzyme molecule? Upon putting this into practice interesting results were observed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> Out of a library of 15,000 mutant enzymes several were identified showing improved S-selectivity, the two best ones, variants D and E leading to E-values of 3.0 and 6.5, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</p><p>It can be seen that in each case three amino acids were indeed exchanged and that the hot spots occur in regions very different from those of the previous mutants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6</ref> At this stage we decided to apply combinatorial multiple-cassette mutagenesis (CMCM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">23</ref> in modified form. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> This was accomplished by performing DNA shuffling <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">23</ref> with mutant genes encoding the two best enzyme variants obtained at high mutation rate (mutants D and E, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>) and an oligocassette with simultaneous saturation at previously identified hot spots 155 and 162 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Position 162 had previously been identified as a hot spot by cassette mutagenesis in the hot region of 160 -163. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> Indeed, this strategy turned out to be successful because several highly enantioselective enzymes were found, among them variant J with six exchanged amino acids (D20N, S53P, S155M, L162G, T180I, and T234S). <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> The E-value turned out to be .51 (ee.95%), which underlines the value of this approach.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> summarizes these and further efforts regarding the exploration of protein sequence space with respect to the enantioselectivity of the model reaction catalyzed by lipase mutants from P. aeruginosa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> A total of only 40,000 mutant enzymes were screened. It is clear that presently no algorithm can be presented according to which the optimal search strategy can be predicted. Rather, at this stage it is necessary to move in protein sequence space in relatively small steps and to make decisions for further action as the results unfold. It may appear disturbing that in some cases continuous improvements upon performing a certain type of mutagenesis in repeating cycles are not observed (e.g. third cycle of epPCR at high mutation rate, Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). However, this is really not surprising. DNA-shuffling, which ensures high diversity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">10</ref> needs to be applied in such cases. The  Figure 7. Schematic representation of the directed evolution of enantioselective enzymes (lipase variants) catalyzing the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of ester 1. 22</p><p>study described here is the first example of the use of DNA-shuffling in the quest to increase the enantioselectivity of an enzyme, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">27</ref> and we are certain that this technique will be of help in other cases as well.</p><p>These studies have taught us that protein sequence space with respect to enantioselectivity is best explored by undertaking the following steps: <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> 1. Generation of mutants by epPCR at high (or low) mutation rate; 2. Identification of hot spots and application of saturation mutagenesis; 3. Identification of hot regions and application of cassette mutagenesis; and 4. Extension of the process of CMCM to cover a defined region in protein sequence space.</p><p>As already outlined, the enzyme variant J showing an E-value of .51 has six amino acid exchanges relative to the wild-type. In contrast to the five mutations of the variant C showing an E-value of only 25 as previously discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">19</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>), the six exchanges occurring with the new variant are not all remote. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">22</ref> Rather, about half of them are close to the active site and the rest are remote. The analysis of this phenomenon has not yet been performed, nor have crystals been obtained for an X-ray analysis of variant J. However, kinetic studies show that this variant is highly efficient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">25</ref> In going from the wild-type to variant J, the k cat /K m -value increases significantly: for (S )-1, k cat /K m ¼9. Finally, we were interested in reversing the direction of enantioselectivity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">27</ref> i.e. in evolving (R )-selective variants starting from the same wild-type lipase from P. aeruginosa. This was achieved by screening for (R )-selective variants. In the initial library of lipase mutants created at high mutation rate (in which two (S )-selective variants were found as described above), the process of screening 15,000 mutants also revealed the presence of several variants showing a stereochemically opposite trend. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">26</ref> For example, two (R )-selective mutants were identified characterized by a single mutation V232I (E¼2.0) and four mutations S112P, S147N, T150A and T226A (E¼1.1). The former one was used for another cycle of high error mutagenesis resulting in the identification of two variants displaying E-values of 3.0 and 3.7. A third cycle afforded a mutant with E¼7.0 in favor of (R )-1.</p><p>At this stage another cycle of epPCR-based mutagenesis failed to produce further improvements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">26</ref> Therefore, DNA-shuffling 10 was applied. These efforts culminated in the creation of an enzyme variant having 11 mutations and showing a selectivity factor of E¼30 in favor of (R )-1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">26</ref> Although the source of enantioselectivity has not been illuminated, it was shown that the hot spots are very different from those of the (S )-selective mutants. Moreover, some of the mutations are near the active site, while others occupy remote positions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">26</ref> The ultimate goal is to obtain the X-ray crystal structures of the most (S )-and (R )-selective mutants, which would allow a more quantitative analysis. Work along these lines is continuing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Directed evolution of hybrid catalysts</head><p>Although the directed evolution of functional enzymes offers many exciting perspectives for future applications in organic synthesis, one obvious limitation is the fact that the reaction types amenable to this type of optimization are restricted to enzymatic processes. This means that the majority of organic transformations catalyzed by transition metals 1 are outside of the realm defined by enzyme catalysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> For example, enzymes cannot catalyze such reactions as hydroformylation, olefin metathesis, allylic substitution, hydrosilylation, etc. If they could, then it would be possible to apply the methods of directed evolution in order to tune activity as well as chemo-, regio-and stereoselectivity. We have therefore proposed the concept of directed evolution of hybrid catalysts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">28</ref> It involves the following steps:</p><p>1. Choice of an enzyme (or any protein) which ideally fulfills the following criteria (a) is stable (b) can be overexpressed in appreciable amounts (c) has a reasonably sized cavity (enzyme pocket) (d) has a reactive amino acid such as cysteine in the cavity. 2. Application of mutagenesis methods such as epPCR, saturation mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis and/or DNA shuffling to produce libraries of mutant enzymes (variants). 3. En masse chemical modification of each mutant enzyme so that a transition metal center is implanted at the reactive site (e.g. thiol function of cysteine) in the enzyme cavity. 4. En masse screening of the mutant hybrid catalysts in a given transition metal catalyzed reaction. 5. Repeating X-times the process of mutagenesis/ expression/chemical modification/screening using the best catalyst identified in each step.</p><p>Of course, if the host enzyme has no cysteine, it can be introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, or if it has more than one cysteine, they can be substituted. moieties has been performed previously for other reasons, Kaiser's work being seminal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">29</ref> In our case the implantation of a transition metal at a defined position can occur by one of two ways (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Direct coordination with an appropriate transition metal salt at the reactive functional group, e.g. cysteine (case A, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>), or attachment of an achiral ligand system bearing the transition metal (case B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemical modification of enzymes at reactive cysteine</head><p>In exploratory work we have utilized both pathways using wild-type papain as the protein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">30</ref> Papain is a protease occurring in the papaya fruit (Carica papaya ). Expression systems have been described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">31</ref> At this stage the reader is reminded of the fact that protease activity is of no interest in our endeavor, because the protein simply acts as a host and thus as a ligand which can be manipulated structurally by directed evolution. Other proteins may be better.</p><p>As far as path B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>) is concerned, we have developed building blocks which permit the ready introduction of such ligands as pyridines, dipyridines, and diphosphines as well as mixed bidentate systems in the model protein papain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">30</ref> The catalytic profiles of the respective metal complexes are of limited interest, because any beneficial effects in a catalytic reaction would be purely fortuitous. It is the possibility of optimizing any desired catalytic property (or properties) by means of directed evolution which is the basis of our concept. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">28</ref> Thus, out of a library of thousands of mutants the 'best' protein for catalyst implantation and catalyst performance can be identified as a consequence of screening. The mutant gene can then be subjected once more to mutagenesis, followed by chemical modification and screening. It can be anticipated that this Darwinistic procedure will induce amino acid exchange processes which will lead to catalysts displaying the desired catalytic profile with respect to activity and selectivity in a given transition metal catalyzed reaction. This means that the flow of genetic information is being extended from the gene to organometallic chemistry (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>).</p><p>This touches on a fundamental question in catalysis that has been addressed and answered decades ago, namely: what is the fundamental difference between a synthetic catalyst (e.g. a conventional transition metal complex) and an enzyme? Pauling <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">32</ref> and thereafter the majority of the scientific community <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">33</ref> postulate that it is the transition state of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction which is stabilized (E•TS). As the geometry of the reacting substrate changes upon reaching the transition state, various stabilizing interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals effects and electrostatic attractions are maximized. Thus, it is not just the effects exerted by the actual catalytically active center which are important, but also and specifically those arising in the environment around the transition state. Of course, solvation and desolvation also play a role. An alternative view centers around the postulate that (many) enzymatic reactions take place through so-called near attack conformers (NACs) that resemble the transition state, these being brought about by enzyme -substrate interactions (E•NACs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">34</ref> Although this is quite different from the Pauling postulate, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions again play a pivotal role, i.e. the protein microenvironment is crucial.</p><p>In contrast, in a reaction mediated by a synthetic catalyst, the energy of the transition state is defined solely by the electronic and steric interactions between the active site (e.g. a metal center) and the substrate (or other reaction partners), the whole entity (and thus the transition state) being intimately surrounded by the solvent. Thus, it makes a difference whether a transition state or a short-lived complex is surrounded by a protein capable of exerting various activating effects, or whether it is surrounded solely by solvent molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">33</ref> The intriguing situation now arises when placing a synthetic catalyst (e.g. metal center) in the cavity of an enzyme, as we are doing. Obviously, the usual electronic and steric factors expected of the catalyst in the absence of a protein environment will operate. However, now 'enzyme-like' interactions of the type described above can also exert an influence. As already indicated, there is no reason to believe that such interactions will already be at a maximum in the case of the hybrid catalyst prepared from the wild-type protein. Indeed, there may be no effect. However, the process of directed evolution makes possible the optimal sequence of amino acids necessary for additional activation. Thus, one and the same synthetic catalyst can be expected to display different activity in a given reaction, depending upon the nature of the mutant protein that surrounds it.</p><p>In addition to enhancing catalyst activity with respect to the wild-type hybrid catalyst, it should also be possible to apply directed evolution in the quest to tune chemo-and stereoselectivity. Once achieved, it will be of considerable theoretical interest to uncover the source of improved catalyst activity and/or selectivity. Among the synthetic challenges are the control of regio-and stereoselectivity in Rh-catalyzed hydroformylation and hydrogenation, Pd-or Ir-catalyzed allylic substitution as well as cis/transselectivity in Ru-catalyzed ring-closing olefin metathesis, in addition to stereoselective redox processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions and perspectives</head><p>Directed evolution of enantioselective enzymes constitutes a fundamentally new approach to asymmetric catalysis. <ref type="bibr">5,6, 18 -20,22,24,26,27</ref> Rather than relying on site directed mutagenesis based on molecular modeling, the method is independent of any knowledge of the structure and mechanism of the particular enzyme being studied. In a certain sense the strategy is nevertheless rational, because it is based on the evolutionary (Darwinistic) principle. Of course, the combination of directed evolution and sitedirected mutagenesis is also promising. We are in the process of applying the methods of directed evolution to other enzymes and substrates. Attention also needs to be paid to developing alternative methods to search protein sequence space for enantioselective mutants of a given enzyme. For example, performing saturation mutagenesis systematically at every (or nearly every) position of a given enzyme one by one creates small libraries of mutants which constitute good starting points for beginning detailed directed evolution studies.</p><p>Finally, a fundamentally new way to tune any desired property of a man-made transition metal catalyst such as activity, cis/trans-selectivity or regio-and stereoselectivity may be possible on the basis of the directed evolution of hybrid catalysts. From a present perspective it appears that the major challenges in putting this novel concept into industrial practice are primarily of a technical nature. Efficient overexpression/secretion systems as well as highthroughput parallel reactor types are one of the truly difficult prerequisites. A successful implementation would constitute a practical fusion of molecular biology and transition metal chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">35</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
