  "key_claims": [
    "Substrates used include γ-butyrolactones (1), γ-butyrothiolactone (2), δvalerolactone (3), dihydrocoumarin (4) for lactones; phenyl esters like phenyl acetate (5a), naphtyl esters such as 2-naphtylacetate (6a), and carboxy flourescein diacetate (10) for esters; and organophosphates DEPCyC (8a), coumaphousoxon (8b), paraoxon (9a), and its 2-flouro derivative (9b) for phosphotriesters."
