<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The construction of custom libraries is critical for rational protein engineering and directed evolution. Array-synthesized oligo pools of thousands of user-defined sequences (up to ~350 bases in length) have emerged as a low-cost commercially available source of DNA. These pools cost � 10 % (depending on error rate and length) of other commercial sources of custom DNA, and this significant cost difference can determine whether an enzyme engineering project can be realized on a given research budget. However, while being cheap, oligo pools do suffer from a low concentration of individual oligos and relatively high error rates. Several powerful techniques that specifically make use of oligo pools have been developed and proven valuable or even essential for next-generation protein and pathway engineering strategies, such as sequence-function mapping, enzyme minimization, or de-novo design. Here we consolidate the knowledge on these techniques and their applications to facilitate the use of oligo pools within the protein engineering community.</p></div>

In the context of enzyme engineering, information-rich sequence-function maps obtained from such methods allowed researchers to probe the relationship between enzyme fitness and solubility, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and heterologous expression levels, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> it has been used to identify sequence determinants of enzymatic substrate specificity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and it has been used to create smart libraries for directed evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> A collection of available DMS data sets is currently consolidated here: <ref type="url" target="https://www.mavedb.org">https://www.mavedb.org</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Further, computational tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and de novo protein design strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> currently revolutionize the way we do protein science. For example, AI has been used to guide and accelerate the pace of directed evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and has recently been used to predict from mostly database-available sequences which combination of mutations likely yields a functionally optimized protein or enzyme (in respect to a specific user-set function). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> While these developments will continue to expand the functionality of proteins in general and enzymes specifically, they also demand the creation of massive variant libraries. For instance, to create a DMS library of a 300 amino acid protein, 5701 gene variants (the wildtype sequence plus 19 amino acid exchanges for all 300 positions) need to be generated. For the functional optimization of a protein or the de novo design of a protein -even when using state-of-the-art AI algorithms or the best de novo protein design protocols to reduce library sizebetween ten and a few thousand full genes need to be synthesized and tested to find the desired function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref> While massive parallel sequencing of DNA has become very affordable over time, the synthesis of DNA is however still prohibitively expensive when considering the scale needed to build complex libraries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> As such, DNA synthesis becomes a new bottleneck for next-generation protein engineering.</p><p>The currently cheapest available source of synthetic DNA is micro-array-synthesized oligonucleotides, commercially available as 'oligo pools'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Oligo pools are mixes of thousands of individually designed polynucleotides of up to 350 bases in length. Traditionally, oligonucleotides have been synthesized by solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> This column-based synthesis generates up to 200 mers with error rates of 1 in 200, yields of 10 to 100 nmol per product for a cost of 0.05-1 USD per base dependent on the length and concentration yield. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> These individually synthesized oligonucleotides are then routinely further used for the synthesis of gene-length DNA fragments using different PCR-based methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> To increase throughput and decrease the cost of oligonucleotide synthesis, several technologies have been developed over the last three decades to synthesize oligonucleotides in spatially decoupled microarrays, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> lowering costs by several orders of magnitude (0.00001 to 0.001 USD per base). <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> Microarray-based technologies allow synthesizing thousands of individual userdefined sequences, eventually delivered as a pool of molecules.</p><p>Even though these microarray-based oligo pools are cheap, there are several challenges in using them for gene synthesis and library creation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> First, while the number of individual user-defined oligo sequences in a pool is large, their individual concentration is quite low. This challenges their use in traditional gene synthesis protocols, which still mostly rely on oligos from column-based synthesis. Second, the longer the oligos the higher the percentage of truncated molecules, further lowering the expected concentration of full-length molecules. Third, the error rates for oligo pools are usually higher than those for column-synthesized oligos.</p><p>Noteworthy, a recently published oligo pool purification method (multiplex oligonucleotide library purification by synthesis and selection (MOPSS)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that distinguishes full-length oligos from oligos with insertions and deletions, will partly overcome this issue if a user is willing to add an extra purification step before library creation.</p><p>Early on, oligo pools have been adopted for the creation of guide RNA libraries for functional genomics studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> for barcoding within screening platforms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and the creation of libraries of short regulatory elements such as promoters, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> enhancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> or silencers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> These applications require only short DNA (20 to 100 bases) stretches and can thus manage the shortcomings of oligo pools in limited sequence length, high error rate, and incomplete synthesis.</p><p>Libraries for enzyme engineering ideally require the synthesis of error-free DNA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Changing Residues: Oligo Pool-Based Multiple Site-Saturation Mutagenesis and Deep Mutational Scanning Libraries</head><p>Site-directed mutagenesis has been foundational to protein and enzyme engineering. While commercially available methods like QuikChange™ have long been available to create targeted libraries that mutate single and multiple residues, next-generation protein engineering technologies require massive parallel changes to a protein sequence. Towards this end, a handful of scalable mutagenesis methods that achieve (near) comprehensive mutagenesis of open reading frames have been developed: PFunkel, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> Nicking Mutagenesis (NM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> and programmed allelic series (PALS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> are in vitro methods and plasmid recombineering (PR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> and CRISPR-enabled trackable Genome engineering (CREATE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> are in vivo methods for use in E. coli and the yeast S. cerevisiae.</p><p>In this review, we highlight those methods (NM, PALS, PR and CREATE), that have been tested to be compatible with the use of array-synthesized oligo pools rather than individually column-synthesized and hand-mixed oligonucleotide pools. Thus, these methods allow for the cost-effective creation of custom libraries. Noteworthy, even though not explicitly tested in a published format, likely, PFunkel <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> would also work with array-synthesized oligo pools as it is the precursor technique for the development of NM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">In vitro techniques for saturation mutagenesis</head><p>Nicking mutagenesis (NM) allows for the one-pot generation of targeted or comprehensive single-site or multi-site saturation mutagenesis libraries in a single day, using regular molecular biology techniques: It requires routinely prepped plasmid DNA, a pool of oligonucleotides, two nicking restriction endonucleases (Nt.BbvCI and Nb.BbvCI), an exonuclease (Exo III), a high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Phusion) and a ligase (Taq). The only non-routine requirement is that the plasmid DNA needs to encode the 7 bp BbvCl recognition site, which can be introduced into any plasmid by regular cloning techniques.</p><p>The workflow of NM starts by selectively degrading one plasmid DNA strand via the nicking restriction endonuclease Nt.BbvCI and exonuclease treatment. The obtained circular single-stranded DNA subsequently serves as the template for primers that encode for the desired mutations. The ratio of primer to template allows tuning the number of mutations per gene. If the number of primer molecules is much lower than the number of template molecules, then effectively only one primer can bind per template. Each primer is then extended by a high-fidelity polymerase and the created strand is ligated with Taq DNA ligase resulting in covalently closed circular doublestranded DNA. One strand contains the mutations, the other the wild-type sequence. Subsequent treatment with a second Overview of the discussed methods for mutagenic library creation, gene-and pathway assembly, and library analysis. A) Oligo pool-based methods to generate protein libraries, gene fragment libraries, or pathways. 1) Single residue saturation mutagenic libraries, such as those used for deep-mutational scanning, can be created from oligo pools by Nicking Mutagenesis (NM), <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> programmed allelic series (PALS), <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> plasmid recombineering (PR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or CRISPRenabled trackable Genome engineering (CREATE). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> 2) Libraries where short DNA stretches are comprehensively inserted, such as required for protein minimization, have been created by PR and can likely be created by NM, PALS, and CREATE. Single-residue deletion libraries have been created by PALS.</p><p>3) Complex pools of many different proteins fragments can be created by multiple pairwise assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and DropSynth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> 4) Larger genes and pathways can be assembled as shown by Wan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> B) Library sequence analysis: The quality of libraries needs to be analyzed for the frequency of programmed mutations (red dot) and the frequency of off-target mutations (cross). 1) Short-read sequencing -as offered via Illumina-based services -is highly accurate, high in throughput, and widely accessible but the short read-length leads to a narrow resolution window. Libraries need to be tiled to be accurately quality controlled, as off-target mutations outside the resolution window are otherwise invisible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> 2) Molecular barcoding and computational assembly can overcome the limited read length in NGS as full-length sequences of mutagenized clones can be obtained from short NGS reads. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> 3) Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing, followed by computational error correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> or combined with variant-concatenation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> starts to allow long-read sequencing for library quality control in protein engineering.</p><p>nicking restriction endonuclease (Nb.BbvCI, binds and nicks the reverse complementary Nt.BbvCI recognition site) and exonuclease leads to digestion of the still-wild-type strand of the plasmid DNA, yielding a single-stranded mutated plasmid. Amplification with a universal primer that binds outside the target area for mutagenesis eventually creates a doublestranded plasmid with the manifested mutations in both strands.</p><p>In the original paper describing NM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> the authors used a hand-made mix of column-synthesized oligonucleotides to establish the method. Later, it became clear that very little primer was needed for the introduction of point mutations and that primers encoded as micro-array synthesized oligo pools could be used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> The authors test the oligo-pool based NM with three short protein segments of &lt; 100 residues (short enough to enable full sequencing via paired-end reads, see section 5) and show that dependent on the oligo-concentration, 97.4 to 100 % mutational coverage could be reached after a single round of NM (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Noteworthy, all 7118 oligos required for mutagenizing all three proteins were ordered together as one single pool. They further show that the use of oligo pools leads to a more even representation of each amino acid when compared to using NNN codon randomized and hand-mixed column-synthesized primers.</p><p>Full sequencing analysis of the three test libraries showed that they consisted of 14-37 % plasmids with the designed one non-synonymous mutation, 52-71 % plasmids with wild-type sequence (likely due to template molecules that did not participate in or complete the mutagenesis cycle), and 11-15 % plasmids with more than one non-synonymous mutation (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The authors observed that a higher melting temperature of a given primer correlated with higher mutational frequency, giving room for optimization of the protocol. The authors further tested if NM could be used for subsequent multi-site mutagenesis by subjecting the single-site saturation library to a second cycle of NM. After this second cycle performed with one of the test proteins, the authors show coverage of 79 % of all possible positions. Double mutations were depleted in near adjacent positions, likely because a second oligonucleotide would either not anneal properly or overwrite the mutation from the first oligonucleotide. An optimized protocol for performing multi-site NM has recently been developed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> This protocol uses model-driven oligo design to achieve &gt; 99 % coverage of a multi-site mutagenized 32.768 membered antibody library (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The authors further provide an automated workflow for oligo pool design using a protein-coding sequence as the sole input.</p><p>Scalability of the single-site NM method <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> was later shown by saturation mutagenizing the bacteriophage ΦX174, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> specifically its two main proteins the F capsid protein (421 amino acids scanned) and G spike protein (172 amino acids scanned). The libraries possessed greater than 99 % of all 11.860 programmed mutations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). All required oligos could be ordered in one pool. To enable the replication of the plasmids in E. coli, the genome was divided into 14 non-toxic and nonreplicative fragments. The F capsid protein and G spike protein were each tiled into two fragments. Golden Gate cloning was then used to assemble the complete ΦX174 mutant genome Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

It has a few more steps than NM, takes rather two instead of one day to prepare the library and it leads overall to slightly lower coverage than NM (as such, libraries are called near-comprehensive, reported 98 % coverage after a single round, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Instead of amplifying the full plasmid that encodes the target region for mutagenesis as done in NM, PALS only uses a PCR amplified target fragment as input. Therefore, PALS might become the method of choice in case the used plasmids are large and full amplification becomes inconvenient (e. g. as usually the case for mammalian vectors) or in case the mutagenic library is supposed to be encoded in the genome of an organism. In that case, the PALS PCR library can directly be used as a homology-directed repair fragment for genome engineering.</p><p>PALS is based on the annealing and extension of mutagenic oligos along a deoxyuracil (dU)-marked wild-type sense strand. The dU-marking allows the experimenter to specifically digest the wild-type sense strand after the extension is completed using uracil-DNA-glycosylase and exonuclease VIII (also known as USER enzyme mix). Each mutagenic oligo encodes for a unique 3'-priming site and a common 5'-priming site which are subsequently used to amplify the extended oligos by PCR creating a single-mutagenized double-stranded library (the unique priming sites get cleaved). At this point each library member has a different 3'end, depending on where the mutagenic oligo annealed. To create the full template length, the 5'-3' strand of the mutagenized amplicons are used as mega primers to extend their 3' ends along a dU-marked wildtype anti-sense strand.</p><p>The required dU-marked (single-stranded) sense and antisense strands can be created via PCR using dUs instead of dTs as nucleotides and by using a phosphorylated reverse or forward primer. The phosphorylation of the 5'end is harnessed to digest the antisense or sense strand via lambda exonuclease, leaving a dU-marked (single-stranded) sense and antisense strand.</p><p>After one round of PALS on two test proteins (the DNAbinding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4, and the full human transcription factor p53) the authors report 93-98 % coverage, with 33-47 % of the molecules showing the correct single mutations, 24-30 % of the molecules being wild type and 21-35 % of molecules having additional mutations on top of the programmed single mutation (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ChemBioChem</head><p>electroporation cells are recovered for several hours without antibiotic selection, followed by overnight growth under plasmid-selective conditions. Plasmids can then be miniprepped to recover the library or one can directly continue with functional selection for the desired protein phenotype. Higgins et al. show that a nearly comprehensive mutational-scanning library can be achieved in a single transformation. They found 99.8 % of all possible single amino acid conversions represented, for their 110-residue model protein iLOV (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Similar to the in vitro methods, no selection against wild-type plasmid is included in the method and they find that about 29 % of their plasmids have a single mutation while over 61 % of all plasmids are the wild type (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Five subsequent rounds of PR lowered the frequency of finding wild-type plasmids to 26 %, while 33 % of colonies had a single mutation and 41 % of plasmids had two or more mutations. As such, the authors also show that multiple rounds of PR (five rounds in the reported case) can be used to create targeted double-site saturation libraries with high coverage (98 %, Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</p><p>In their first proof-of-concept of PR, Higgins et al. use a mix of 110 column-synthesized oligonucleotides rather than arraysynthesized oligo pools, but in a later study, they show that amplified oligo pools can be used for PR mutagenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> As a technical remark, PR should theoretically work with any template that replicates in E. coli, but it needs to be performed in a suitable strain background that encodes and expresses the Lambda Red system (including the ß protein) and carries a deletion for MutS. The MutS deletion is required to inactivate the mismatch repair system in E. coli and allow for effective recombination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> The E. coli strain EcNR2 which is widely used for recombineering is available via Addgene (#26931). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> A second method that uses array-synthesized oligo pools as a starting point for in vivo saturation mutagenesis is CREATE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> In comparison to PR, which acts upon plasmid-encoded targets, CREATE is designed to act upon chromosomally encoded proteins and full pathways and allows for pathway-or even genome-wide deep mutational analysis. Mutagenesis is based on inducing a genomic double-strand break in a protein of interest via CRISPR/Cas9 and allowing the cell to repair the break via homologous recombination with a short homology arm (up to 120 bp) that encodes the programmed mutation and a synonymous mutation in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) to prevent future cleavage. Both, the guide RNA (gRNA), which programs the cut site, and the homology arm are encoded together on a plasmid as a so-called CREATE cassette. The CREATE cassette library (library of all gRNAs and repair arms, typically 10 4 to 10 6 members) is thereby designed computationally and ordered as an array-synthesized oligo pool, amplified by PCR, and cloned into a cassette vector. The covalent linkage of the gRNA with the programmed edit on the homology arm allows the experimenter to use the CREATE cassette as a plasmid-encoded barcode during future selections, assuming that frequency of changes in a CREATE plasmid and the edited genome frequency stay coupled during growth.</p><p>The authors first test CREATE by inactivating the galK gene of E. coli by introducing a single nonsense mutation. Depending on the length of the used homology arm (80 to 120 bp) and the distance of the mutagenized site from the PAM (17 to 59 bp), CREATE achieves editing efficiencies of 75 to 90 %, as judged by a galK-based colorimetric assay. Sequencing revealed that 71 % of those edited clones carried the designed nonsense mutation plus the designed synonymous mutation in the PAM sequence, 26 % contained only the PAM edit, and 3 % showed neither of the designed edits at this locus (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>Further, CREATE could be functionally transferred into the yeast S. cerevisiae. Editing of the S. cerevisiae ade2 gene to introduce a tandem stop codon showed editing efficiencies of 95 % based on a colorimetric read-out, with 100 % of those phenotypic hits being correctly programmed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>In a follow-up study, the authors show the scalability of CREATE by deep mutagenesis of an entire metabolic network. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> Specifically, the authors designed 16,300 mutations within the binding-pockets of 19 enzymes or transporters, that comprise four primary routes that guide lysine flux in E. coli. Using NGS analysis of four test loci, the authors show the library coverage to range between 22.7 to 61.6 %, indicating high editing efficiencies given the size of the library (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Eventually, by mutationally perturbing E. coli's lysin metabolic network and subsequently challenging this library with the antimetabolite AEC, the authors could evaluate in parallel the contribution of these 16,300 targeted mutations toward antimetabolite resistance and thus overall pathway flux. As such, the authors could (near) comprehensively map sequence-function relations that alter the pathway's function, setting a framework for investigating complex multigenic phenotypes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Further considerations for saturation mutagenesis</head><p>In summary, NM, PALS, PR and CREATE are effective ways to create (near-)comprehensive single-site or multi-site mutagenic libraries with the use of oligo pools. For library screening and associated library coverage calculations, it needs to be kept in mind that all methods lead to libraries that show only ~50 % or less of the total molecules to be desired single mutations, and contain a significant amount of wild-type plasmid or plasmids with non-desired mutations (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Mutation efficiency might not matter in case a high-throughput selection is available, but might be limiting for protein engineering efforts that require expensive or laborious screens as the number of screened mutants needs to be doubled to cover such a library (compared to a 100 % mutagenized library).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Encoding Complex Libraries of Short Genes (up to 700 bp) via Oligo Pools</head><p>Once the number of required changes per open reading frame increases, site-directed mutagenesis can become inefficient, and complete de novo synthesis of a gene is required. In enzyme engineering, this can be the case when a heterologous enzyme or a full pathway of multiple enzymes needs to be recoded for optimized codon usage or if various genes of a pathway need to be engineered together. One field that historically depended on the massive synthesis of new-tonature DNA is the field of de novo protein design. Here, often &gt; 7000 computational designs need to be tested for sequencefunction relations. Not surprisingly, this field has early on developed techniques that use oligo pools for the synthesis of these designs.</p><p>In this section, we will introduce gene synthesis methods that are optimized to produce large libraries of different gene fragments in one pool. Those libraries are typically required during large-scale functional testing of de novo designed proteins, and for targeted protein engineering at multiple sites. Those methods are less suitable for synthesizing long genes (&gt; 700 bp) or a pathway. Methods that are suitable to assemble a single gene or a multi-gene pathway from oligo pools, rather than a library of variants, will be discussed in section 4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Gene assembly in one pot without compartmentalization</head><p>In an effort to assemble 2271 designs of a short, 64 to 84 amino acid long protein domain, Klein et al. developed a method called multiplexed pairwise assembly (herein abbreviated as MPA) that allows assembling gene fragment libraries of ~250 bp in length in joint-pools of 250 to 2271 targets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> Similar to the saturation-mutagenesis methods reported above, MPA relies on relatively standard enzymatic molecular biology ChemBioChem reactions for assembly. In pools of relatively low complexity (250 targets), MPA achieved the error-free synthesis of on average 90.5 % of these 250 targets (% coverage, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Increasing the target pool complexity to the synthesis of the complete desired set of 2271 protein designs simultaneously in one-pot, MPA still allowed the error-free synthesis of 70.6 % of the 2271 targets (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>); and 11.8 to 31.3 % of all assembled molecules are error-free (% accuracy, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) Although not shown, one can imagine that the 250 bp fragments assembled via MPA can be assembled to longer genes using, for example, Golden Gate assembly.</p><p>MPA starts with designing the 250 bp target. Each target is then computationally divided into two partially overlapping fragments A and B (each fragment is 160 bp including the adaptors required for priming later in the protocol). Oligo encoded fragments are ordered containing one 3' pool-specific and one 5' general adaptor for priming. This allows encoding all fragments in one oligo pool but to specifically amplify those that go into an assembly reaction together. The primers binding to the pool-specific adaptors are uracil-containing, such that these priming sites (as they would interfere with hybridization of A and B fragments) can be removed prior to assembly with Uracil Specific Excision Reagent (USER enzymes). The assembly is based on overlap extension PCR using the same outer primers as used for oligo amplification. Although deep sequencing revealed that between 70 % and 90.5 % (depending on the number of targets per pool) of the assembled targets had correct error-free molecules represented in the pool of all molecules (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), those error-free molecules needed to be purified from the pool of all error-containing molecules for downstream applications. Here the authors use dial-out PCR, a method that allows identifying and amplifying error-free assemblies to retrieve them for downstream applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref> Specifically, in dial-out PCR, single molecules get tagged with unique barcodes before sequencing.

The concept is that all oligos required for one assembly get hybridized to a microbead using oligo-barcodes. The oligocoated microbeads then get encapsulated in a water-in-oil droplet, creating spatially separate reactions.</p><p>DropSynth follows several steps: The genes to be synthesized are first bioinformatically split into several fragments, such that each fragment can fit onto one oligo. Restriction sites and a microbead barcode are also added to each oligo. Oligos are then amplified by PCR using a biotinylated primer, followed by digestion at high temperature to expose the microbead barcode as a single-stranded DNA overhang. Processed oligos are mixed with a pool of either 384 or 1536 barcoded microbeads (limited by the number of unique barcodes), with each microbead containing only one complementary barcode sequence. Complementary oligos (all that are required for a specific assembly) hybridize and are ligated to the microbeads. The loaded beads are then mixed with PCR reagents, a restriction enzyme, and some fluorinated oil and vortexed to form a water-in-oil emulsion, which is placed into a thermocycler where the restriction enzyme displaces the oligos from the bead and the gene assembly reaction takes place inside the droplets. Upon completion, the aqueous solution containing the assembled genes is recovered from the emulsion and PCRamplified for downstream applications. The authors show that the optimized DropSynth 2.0 protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> can be used to build thousands of gene-length fragments at &gt; 20 % accuracy, meaning that &gt; 20 % of the assemblies are error-free, with a coverage of 80-92 % depending on the number of targets that were attempted to be assembled in one pool (% coverage, Table <ref type="table">3</ref>).</p></div>

As such, the created libraries must be properly evaluated for coverage, target mutation frequency, and off-target mutation frequency, to calculate a sufficient screening sample size to ensure library coverage. Evaluation has mostly been done by short-read NGS (also called second-generation sequencing), such as Illumina-based sequencing, because of the high throughput, low cost, and wide accessibility of the method. One limitation of second-generation sequencing is the inherent short read length (75 to 500 nucleotides for Illumina sequencing platform). Therefore, a mutation that is located outside of the read-window would be invisible in a library analysis. Because of these limitations, DMS or de novo protein-coding is usually performed on small genes or subsets of genes (tiling) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). Several second-generation sequencing approaches designed for protein engineering have been reviewed elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Here we only want to highlight methods that overcome the resolution window in second-generation sequencing, and recent methods that improve so-called long-read (third-generation) sequencing approaches and make them suitable for library analysis in protein engineering.</p></div>

His research interests include structural biology, protein-protein interactions, and fluorescent spectroscopy. Rianne C. Prins obtained her MSc in molecular cell biology from the University of Groningen in 2018 and is currently working on her PhD project at the Molecular Microbiology group at the Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute, Faculty of Science and Engineering in Groningen, the Netherlands. Her PhD research is focused on sequence-function relationships and protein engineering of yeast killer toxins. Sonja Billerbeck holds a Master in Microbiology and Biochemistry from the University of Tübingen and the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, and a PhD in Bioengineering from ETH Zürich. After postdoctoral work in yeast Synthetic Biology at Columbia University in New York City, she joined the University of Groningen as an Assistant Professor in 2019. Her laboratory uses a combination of synthetic biology, genome engineering, protein engineering, and environmental microbiology to access, understand and engineer the functional diversity of nature's yeastbased mycobiome for applications in human health, industrial biotechnology and to answer fundamental questions on yeast (pathogen) biology.</figDesc></figure>

Overview of the discussed methods for mutagenic library creation, gene-and pathway assembly, and library analysis. A) Oligo pool-based methods to generate protein libraries, gene fragment libraries, or pathways. 1) Single residue saturation mutagenic libraries, such as those used for deep-mutational scanning, can be created from oligo pools by Nicking Mutagenesis (NM),<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref> programmed allelic series (PALS),<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> plasmid recombineering (PR)<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> or CRISPRenabled trackable Genome engineering (CREATE).<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> 2) Libraries where short DNA stretches are comprehensively inserted, such as required for protein minimization, have been created by PR and can likely be created by NM, PALS, and CREATE. Single-residue deletion libraries have been created by PALS.3) Complex pools of many different proteins fragments can be created by multiple pairwise assembly<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and DropSynth.<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref> 4) Larger genes and pathways can be assembled as shown by Wan et al.<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> B) Library sequence analysis: The quality of libraries needs to be analyzed for the frequency of programmed mutations (red dot) and the frequency of off-target mutations (cross). 1) Short-read sequencing -as offered via Illumina-based services -is highly accurate, high in throughput, and widely accessible but the short read-length leads to a narrow resolution window. Libraries need to be tiled to be accurately quality controlled, as off-target mutations outside the resolution window are otherwise invisible.<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> 2) Molecular barcoding and computational assembly can overcome the limited read length in NGS as full-length sequences of mutagenized clones can be obtained from short NGS reads.<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> 3) Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing, followed by computational error correction<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> or combined with variant-concatenation<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref> starts to allow long-read sequencing for library quality control in protein engineering.</figDesc><graphic coords="4,78.07,66.61,439.20,286.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
