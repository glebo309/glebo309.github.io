Either nature does not care about the specific products, or if she does, she has adopted a different synthetic strategy. In many cases, the appropriate reagents used by synthetic chemists are not readily accessible to biological systems. Here, we discuss our efforts to expand the catalytic repertoire of enzymes to encompass powerful reactions previously known only in small-molecule catalysis: formation and transfer of reactive carbene and nitrene intermediates leading to a broad range of products, including products with bonds not known in biology. In light of the structural similarity of iron carbene (FeC(R 1 )(R 2 )) and iron nitrene (FeNR) to the iron oxo (FeO) intermediate involved in cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation, we have used synthetic carbene and nitrene prec"
