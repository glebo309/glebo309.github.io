<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metrics &amp; More</head><p>Article Recommendations CONSPECTUS: Despite the astonishing diversity of naturally occurring biocatalytic processes, enzymes do not catalyze many of the transformations favored by synthetic chemists. Either nature does not care about the specific products, or if she does, she has adopted a different synthetic strategy. In many cases, the appropriate reagents used by synthetic chemists are not readily accessible to biological systems. Here, we discuss our efforts to expand the catalytic repertoire of enzymes to encompass powerful reactions previously known only in small-molecule catalysis: formation and transfer of reactive carbene and nitrene intermediates leading to a broad range of products, including products with bonds not known in biology. In light of the structural similarity of iron carbene (FeC(R 1 )(R 2 )) and iron nitrene (FeNR) to the iron oxo (FeO) intermediate involved in cytochrome P450-catalyzed oxidation, we have used synthetic carbene and nitrene precursors that biological systems have not encountered and repurposed P450s to catalyze reactions that are not known in the natural world. The resulting protein catalysts are fully genetically encoded and function in intact microbial cells or cell-free lysates, where their performance can be improved and optimized by directed evolution. By leveraging the catalytic promiscuity of P450 enzymes, we evolved a range of carbene and nitrene transferases exhibiting excellent activity toward these new-to-nature reactions. Since our initial report in 2012, a number of other heme proteins including myoglobins, protoglobins, and cytochromes c have also been found and engineered to promote unnatural carbene and nitrene transfer. Due to the altered active-site environments, these heme proteins often displayed complementary activities and selectivities to P450s. Using wild-type and engineered heme proteins, we and others have described a range of selective carbene transfer reactions, including cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, Si-H insertion, B-H insertion, and C-H insertion. Similarly, a variety of asymmetric nitrene transfer processes including aziridination, sulfide imidation, C-H amidation, and, most recently, C-H amination have been demonstrated. The scopes of these biocatalytic carbene and nitrene transfer reactions are often complementary to the state-of-the-art processes based on small-molecule transition-metal catalysts, making engineered biocatalysts a valuable addition to the synthetic chemist's toolbox. Moreover, enabled by the exquisite regio-and stereocontrol imposed by the enzyme catalyst, this biocatalytic platform provides an exciting opportunity to address challenging problems in modern synthetic chemistry and selective catalysis, including ones that have eluded synthetic chemists for decades.</p></div>

Starting a decade ago, our group became interested in expanding the already immense catalytic repertoire of P450s to encompass reactions not known in the biological world. Inspiration came from two sources: (1) Evolution does itnew activities arose during P450 evolution, and there was no reason to think that further innovation was not possible using evolutionary engineering methods. (2) Creative chemists had already shown that the heme cofactor and various derivatives can catalyze reactions not known in nature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref> We reasoned that some of these should be available to the heme cofactor embedded in a protein, and that directed evolution could be used to draw out these latent functions.</p><p>Of special interest to us were the myriad carbene <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref> and nitrene <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> transfer reactions that synthetic chemists had developed. Metal porphyrin complexes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27</ref> including Fe porphyrins, are privileged catalysts for such transformations. As the vital intermediates in these metalloporphyrin-catalyzed processes, metal carbenes and nitrenes supported by the porphyrin ligand have been extensively investigated. In light of the structural similarity between these synthetic Fe carbenes and Fe nitrenes and the native Fe oxene (compound I), we thought we should be able to generate Fe carbene and nitrene intermediates in P450s by exploiting synthetic precursors not present in nature (Scheme 2). Furthermore, we posited that the selective transfer of these reactive species to organic substrates within the enzyme active site would lead to a similarly broad spectrum of synthetically useful transformations.</p><p>In 2012 and 2013, we described repurposing P450s for newto-nature carbene and nitrene transfer reactions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref> Since then, a plethora of biocatalytic stereoselective C-C, C-N, C-Si, and C-B bond forming processes, including ones that are difficult or impossible to achieve with current small-molecule catalysts, have been developed by us and by other research groups who have joined this exciting journey of discovery. In this Account, we survey the evolution of heme proteins for non-natural carbene and nitrene transfer reactions in our lab. We also present the conceptual advances and strategies that were pivotal to this development.</p><p>■ NON-NATURAL BIOCATALYTIC CARBENE TRANSFER: INITIAL DISCOVERY At the outset of our efforts to create new-to-nature enzymes, designing an enzyme to catalyze a new reaction, especially one that is unknown in biochemistry, was widely regarded as a formidable challenge. After all, building a new active site requires placement of multiple functional groups in a binding pocket that can orient substrate(s) and stabilize one or more transition states, depending on the reaction. Designing enzymes de novo was (and still is) notoriously difficult, and it was not clear how a conservative process of directed evolution, one mutation at a time, could create catalytic novelty.</p><p>However, evolution has done it countless times. Less appreciated perhaps by the admirers of enzymes' specificity and selectivity is the fact that many enzymes are also catalytically "promiscuous": <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> they are capable of catalyzing, at some level, chemical reactions unrelated to their biological functions. In the history of evolution, this promiscuity has played a central role in the emergence of new biological functions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41</ref> In recent years, the significance of catalytic promiscuity has been increasingly recognized, and the structural, mechanistic, and evolutionary implications of catalytic promiscuity are being Scheme 2. Structural Similarity of Fe Oxene, Carbene, and Nitrene</p><p>Accounts of Chemical Research pubs.acs.org/accounts Article elucidated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43</ref> Inspired by nature's strategy, we sought to harness promiscuity to discover new enzyme chemistries, especially ones that are synthetically useful and challenging to achieve with small-molecule catalysts. In this context, the demonstrable promiscuity of P450s originating from their structural flexibility 44 makes them excellent candidates for discovery of new-to-nature activities.</p><p>For our initial study, we focused on enantioselective cyclopropanation of alkenes. An enantioenriched, polysubstituted cyclopropane is a common structural element in a variety of medicinal agents. More importantly, Woo previously showed that Fe porphyrin complexes could catalyze such transformations in a racemic fashion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> We discovered that various heme proteins, including myoglobin and cytochrome c, exhibited the desired activity, but a large in-house collection of P450BM3 variants accumulated during our research on P450 oxygenation proved instrumental to showing that selectivity and activity were readily tunable by protein engineering. Upon evaluating a panel of P450BM3 variants, we found that several displayed dramatically enhanced cyclopropanation activity relative to hemin in water, as well as promising enantioselectivity and complementary diastereoselectivity (Scheme 3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Specifically, P450BM3 with a single T268A mutation exhibited excellent trans selectivity for the cyclopropanation of styrene. In contrast, variant P450BM3-CIS (9-10A-TS F87 V T268A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> showed promising cis selectivity, which is rarely observed in small-molecule-catalyzed cyclopropanation processes. It also represented a departure from the innate diastereoselectivity of Fe porphyrin-catalyzed cyclopropanation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> highlighting the role of the protein secondary coordination sphere in controlling the reaction selectivity.</p><p>Mutation T268A was found to be generally activating for cyclopropanation in a series of P450BM3 variants, likely by enlarging the active site for carbene transfer. The T268 residue in P450BM3 operates as the essential hydrogen bond donor in the cleavage of the O-O bond in the native O 2 activation and oxygenation reaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> Previous investigation showed that replacing this threonine with an alanine led to a substantial decrease in the native oxygenase activity. The activating effect of T268A in cyclopropanation thus implies fundamental mechanistic dichotomy between the native oxene transfer and the nonnative carbene transfer chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> ■ AXIAL SERINE-LIGATED "P411" FOR CARBENE TRANSFER For cyclopropanation, the P450 has to be reduced to its ferrous state to initiate the catalytic cycle. In our early work, P450s were used either as purified protein or in cell-free extract in the presence of exogenous reducing agents such as sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 O 4 ). We reasoned that we would be able to develop an in vivo cyclopropanation if the heme enzyme could be readily reduced by endogenous reducing agents such as NAD(P)H. Such whole-cell biocatalysts would greatly simplify the protein engineering process and enable new routes to the sustainable production of valuable compounds.</p><p>We replaced the cysteine thiolate ligand in P450BM3 with a weakly donating serine (Scheme 4). The CO-binding assay of this engineered P450 variant revealed a ferrous CO Soret peak at 411 nm instead of 450 nm in the UV-vis spectrum, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> which is why we refer to the axial-serine-ligated P450 variants as "P411" enzymes. Replacement of this critical Cys residue was known to abolish its monooxygenation activity; in fact, the cysteine thiolate ligand is the only amino acid residue that is conserved in all known functional P450s. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the redox potential E°′(Fe(III)/Fe(II)) of P411 shifted to -293 mV, which is well within the range of reduction by NADPH (E°′ = -320 mV). P411BM3-CIS demonstrated dramatically enhanced in vivo activity for cyclopropanation. By further increasing the substrate concentration, total turnover numbers of up to 67 800 were achieved in whole Escherichia coli cells (Scheme 4). This represented the first highly active biocatalyst for carbene transfer. The advent of P411s turned out to be a key advance for biocatalytic carbene and nitrene transfer reactions. In subsequent studies, we found that serine-ligated P411s were uniquely active for a range of new-to-nature reactions where P450s displayed no or negligible activity.</p><p>■ FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF BIOCATALYTIC CYCLOPROPANATION Expansion of biocatalytic cyclopropanation followed two directions: (1) We further engineered P450BM3 variants to broaden the substrate scope of cyclopropanation, and (2) we explored other heme proteins for biocatalytic cyclopropanation. In subsequent P450BM3 engineering, we continued to explore the role of the Fe-binding axial ligand. Heme proteins naturally use a range of axial ligands, including cysteine, histidine, and tyrosine. The identity of the axial ligand profoundly influences the catalytic activity of heme enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> We found that the C400H variant exhibited the highest activity for in vivo cyclopropanation, while the C400Y and C400S variants shared similar kinetic profiles (Scheme 5). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> Starting from P450BM3 T268A C400H, iterations of sitesaturation mutagenesis (SSM) and screening furnished P450BM3 Hstar (Schemes 6), <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> a highly active catalyst for the cyclopropanation of a wide range of α-substituted acrylamides a TTN = total turnover number. Conditions: 30 mM styrene, 10 mM EDA, 0.2 mol % catalyst, and 10 mM Na 2 S 2 O 4 . Scheme 4. Rationally Engineered "P411" Catalyst for in Vivo Cyclopropanation (2013) a Reaction carried out with neat substrates (170 mM EDA) for 24 h. All other reactions were carried out with 8.5 mM EDA.</p><p>Accounts of Chemical Research pubs.acs.org/accounts Article and acrylates (Scheme 7). <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Subsequent studies on the inactivation mechanism of P450BM3 Hstar revealed that undesired modification of nucleophilic amino acid residues took place following reaction with the incipient electrophilic Fe carbene. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> To reduce inactivation, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of residues prone to modification, which afforded a further improved biocatalyst, P450BM3 Hstar H92N H100N (&gt;20 000 total turnover number, TTN). <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> Deeper mutational screening of the serine-ligated P411BM3-CIS was also fruitful. Directed evolution of P411BM3-CIS led to a set of complementary catalysts, P411-VAC cis and P411-VAC trans , providing access to both the cis-and transdiastereomers of heteroatom-substituted cyclopropanes (X = N, O, and S, Scheme 8). <ref type="bibr">55</ref> Later on, using P411-VAC cis as the template, single mutants P411-VAC cis V87C and P411-VAC cis V87F were found to furnish the cis-and trans-product, respectively, in the cyclopropanation of terminal aliphatic alkenes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56</ref> Cognizant of the vast structural diversity of hemoproteins, we surmised that stereoselectivities not found in P450BM3catalyzed processes could be achieved by exploring other classes of heme proteins with altered active-site environments. Prior to this study, elegant work from the Fasan laboratory demonstrated the utility of engineered myoglobins in carbene transfer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57</ref> We focused on thermophilic heme proteins due to their superior stability and evolvability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56</ref> We found that wild-type Aeropyrum pernix protoglobin (ApePgb) and Rhodothermus marinus nitric oxide dioxygenase (RmaNOD) furnished measurable activity for the cyclopropanation of 1-octene (Scheme 9). Notably, RmaNOD and ApePgb displayed opposite diastereoselectivity, and evolved variants RmaNOD Q52V and ApePgb W59A Y60G F145W furnished the (1S, 2S)-or (1R, 2S)-product with excellent stereocontrol. Combined with P411-VAC cis V87C and P411-VAC cis V87F, we developed a stereodivergent platform to access all four stereoisomers of cyclopropanation products with excellent diastereo-and enantiocontrol.

With strain release, cyclopropenes can be easily converted to a broad spectrum of synthetically useful molecular architectures. Asymmetric catalytic cyclopropenation of alkynes is one of the most widely used methods for the preparation of these motifs in an enantiopure form.

The complete reversal of stereochemistry (+94% ee → -94% ee) upon the introduction of a single mutation, rarely observed in protein engineering, highlighted the outstanding evolvability of P411 biocatalysts. With the P-4 A87F and A87W mutants, additional rounds of SSM and screening ultimately produced variants P411-K10 and P411-C6. These final variants allowed for the enantiodivergent synthesis of cyclopropenes with excellent enantiocontrol (Scheme 11).

Due to the ubiquity of C-H bonds in organic molecules, site-and stereoselective C-H insertion reactions hold the promise to significantly simplify the syntheses of organic compounds. Unlike other late transition metals such as Rh, Cu, Ru, Ag, and Co, Fe catalysts displayed low activities for the catalytic insertion of carbenoids into C-H bonds in previous work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79</ref> Prior to our work, a generally applicable Fe catalyst for the intermolecular C-H insertion was not available.

P411 CHF differs from wild-type P450BM3 by 23 amino acids and lacks the FAD domain of the reductase domain. This truncated P411 variant catalyzed the carbene insertion into a variety of C(sp <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> )-H bonds, including benzylic, allylic, propargylic, and heteroatom-stabilized ones, with excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 19). The use of acceptor carbenes for asymmetric C-H insertion is relatively underdeveloped with rhodium catalysts. Thus, these engineered P411s provided a new solution to enantioselective C-H insertion using acceptor carbenes. Furthermore, variants in the P411 CHF lineage permitted the stereodivergent C-H insertion with N-methyl tetrahydroquinoline, thus allowing for the formal synthesis of both enantiomeric forms of natural product cuspareine.</p><p>The biocatalytic enantioselective C-H insertion nicely illustrates the power of directed evolution in solving challenging problems in catalysis.

This is a rare example of an evolved P411 enzyme showing promising stereocontrol for α,α-disubstituted diazo compounds. Prior to this, engineered Rma cyt c was the only protein class exhibiting good stereocontrol for these substrates.

In a pioneering study published in 1985, Dawson and Breslow demonstrated that mammalian microsomal P450s could catalyze C-H amidation with a turnover frequency (TOF) of ca. 2 min -1 using iminoiodinanes as the nitrene precursor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90</ref> Unfortunately, the rapid solvolysis of iminoiodinanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">91</ref> made it challenging to further optimize this system.</p><p>Almost 30 years later, concurrent to our investigations into carbene transfer, we revisited this nitrene transfer chemistry and engineered P450BM3 variants to enhance the activity for C-H amidation (Scheme 22). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref> We found sulfonyl azides to be superior nitrene precursors for biocatalytic amination reactions, in part due to the excellent water stability of organic azides. Similar to what we observed in P450BM3-catalyzed cyclopropanation, the C-H amidation also starts with ferrous heme, and the T268A and C400S mutations were found to be beneficial.

The P-4 A82L variant, a P411 previously developed for sulfide imidation, was critical to this development, showing low levels of promiscuous activity for benzylic C-H amidation (Scheme 24). Introduction of three active-site mutations greatly improved catalytic efficiency. The final P411 CHA variant effectively transforms diverse benzylic substrates into the corresponding sulfonamides with excellent enantioselectivity (Scheme 25).</p><p>More recently, with a significantly expanded library of P411 variants, we were eager to address unmet challenges in the area of enantioselective C-H functionalization using P411 nitrene transferases (Scheme 26). In principle, three classes of enantioselective C(sp 3 )-H functionalization reactions could be developed. Starting from a substrate bearing two prochiral secondary C(sp 3 )-H bonds, asymmetric C-H functionalization would furnish products with a trisubstituted stereocenter. Desymmetrization of geminal dimethyl-substituted substrates via primary C(sp <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> )-H functionalization would generate a quaternary stereocenter. Furthermore, enantioconvergent functionalization of tertiary C(sp 3 )-H bonds would allow for the formation of tetrasubstituted stereocenters. Such enantioconvergent tertiary C-H functionalizations have long eluded synthetic chemists, presumably due to the lack of suitable mechanisms for stereoconvergence as well as effective catalysts to induce asymmetry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">95</ref> Using the intramolecular C-H amidation of sulfamoyl azide as a model system, we demonstrated that all three modes of enantioinduction could be achieved using P411 catalysts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">96</ref>  Scheme 24.

Active-site engineering led to P411 Diane2 , a variant capable of transforming a range of benzylic substrates into 1,2-diamines with excellent enantioselectivity. In addition, unactivated secondary C(sp 3 )-H bonds were also amidated effectively. By using a set of P411s that only differed by four mutations, both enantiomers could be accessed with good stereocontrol. Furthermore, P411 Diane1 I327P allowed the primary C(sp 3 )-H amidation to occur with excellent activity.</p><p>We also developed enantioconvergent tertiary C-H amidations via a putative stereoablative hydrogen atom transfer (HAT)/stereoselective rebound mechanism. With evolved P411 Diane3 and P411 Diane4 , tetrasubstituted stereocenters possessing a nitrogen group could be efficiently accessed. Notably, this biocatalytic platform could be engineered to construct "methyl-ethyl" stereocenters with excellent enantioselectivity (87% ee). Due to the minimal steric and electronic difference, catalytic asymmetric formation of "methyl-ethyl" stereocenters is a notoriously difficult problem. Our study demonstrated that engineered enzymes could overcome this long-standing obstacle in asymmetric catalysis.</p><p>■ BIOCATALYTIC IMIDATION OF SULFIDES P450-catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of sulfides is a powerful method for the preparation of optically active sulfoxides. Early in our nitrene transfer study, we wondered whether we could develop an analogous nitrene transfer to sulfides to generate enantiomerically enriched sulfimides, which are key intermediates en route to many sulfoximide-containing agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals (Scheme 27). It was found that the P411-CIS T438S variant already showed good activity toward the imidation of sulfides without further engineering (300 TTN, +48% ee). <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">97</ref> Enantiodivergent imidation could also be achieved using an orthogonal set of P411 biocatalysts. Again, this early example showed that, despite the homochirality of biogenic protein catalysts, either antipode of the product could still be conveniently accessed by engineering the protein.</p><p>The spontaneous [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of allylic sulfimides leads to allylic amines.

Further investigation revealed that this sulfide imidation was highly enantioselective. Partial erosion of stereochemical purity of the resulting allylic amine occurred during the [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement presumably due to the competing endo and exo transition states.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EQUIVALENTS OF UNPROTECTED NITRENE</head><p>In previously developed biocatalytic nitrene transfer reactions, sulfonyl azides were the privileged nitrene source. Unfortunately, the removal of the N-sulfonyl group requires harsh reaction conditions, thus limiting the synthetic utility of nitrene transfer products. To circumvent this problem, we initiated a program to explore alternative nitrene precursors with no protective groups attached to the nitrogen. We were particularly intrigued by N-hydroxylamine esters (RC(O)O-NH 2 ) as aminating reagents, because the transformation of these reagents would furnish unprotected primary amines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[103]</ref> The straightforward synthesis of unprotected, enantioenriched primary amines remains a challenging problem. The successful development of biocatalytic primary amination via a nitrene transfer mechanism would allow for the conversion of unfunctionalized alkanes and alkenes into enantioenriched primary amines, thereby complementing transaminase-catalyzed processes.</p><p>From an enzymologist's perspective, the putative iron nitrene species "FeNH" invoked in these amination reactions represents the closest structural mimic of the FeO intermediate (compound I) in native P450 catalysis (Scheme 30). Thus, understanding the bonding and reactivity of this presumed "FeNH" intermediate is of considerable interest to the bioinorganic community.</p><p>We first targeted the amination of styrene derivatives (Scheme 31). Using wild-type Rma cytochrome c as the catalyst, we found that the transfer of unprotected nitrene to styrenes afforded aminoalcohols as the final product, presumably due to the rapid ring opening of the unprotected aziridine under the reaction conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">104</ref> Starting from Rma cyt c, active-site engineering furnished the "TQL" variant, a highly active biocatalyst for the asymmetric aminohydroxylation of diverse styrenes including electron-deficient ones. Further mechanistic study showed that the hydrolysis of the unprotected, enantiopure aziridines is enantiospecific. This finding suggested that enzymatically formed enantioenriched aziridine is a possible precursor to the 1,2-aminoalcohol product.</p><p>We next explored C-H amination reactions using unprotected nitrene equivalents. Using a P411 variant from the P411 CHA lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">94</ref> as the parent, we engineered P411 BPA for the primary amination of benzylic C-H bonds with high activity and excellent enantiocontrol.

Variant P411 APA chemoselectively aminates the allylic C-H bond, leaving the olefin moiety completely untouched. This chemoselectivity is orthogonal to the Rma cyt c TQL variant previously engineered for olefin aminohydroxylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">104</ref> With P411 BPA and P411 APA , an array of easily available hydrocarbon starting materials could be converted into value-added primary amines. Further expanding this intermolecular amination activity to unactivated C(sp 3 )-H bonds would furnish an unprecedented, enzymatic method for the amination of hydrocarbon feedstocks.</p><p>■ EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY OF P450 CARBENE TRANSFERASES AND NITRENE TRANSFERASES P450BM3 has been the primary workhorse for the new-tonature reactions described in this Account. Starting from the wild-type enzyme, we have evolved a family of P450BM3 Scheme 31. Engineered Rma Cytochrome c-Catalyzed Asymmetric Aminohydroxylation (2019) Scheme 32.

We often found that a newly engineered carbene transferase acquired promiscuous activity for previously elusive nitrene transfer reactions. Similarly, newly evolved nitrene transferases opened up exciting opportunities for challenging carbene transfer reactions. Thus, there is a great deal of functional overlap in these new enzymes, which provides starting points for evolution and optimization of yet more novel functions.</p><p>Active-site evolution by site-saturation mutagenesis and screening has proven fruitful for P450-catalyzed carbene and nitrene transfer. Perhaps this is not surprising, since these activities do not require the same finely tuned amino acid environment evolved for P450BM3's native function. Upon a closer examination of the data in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, it is evident that the following residues are important for tuning the enzyme activity and selectivity: (1) residues 70-87 in the B′ region; (2) residues 177-181 in the F helix; (3) residues 261-269 in the I helix; (4) residues 327-330 in the K/K′ loop; (5) residues 436-438 in the loop; and (6) the iron-binding residue 400. The ability to quickly improve an abiological reaction of interest by iteratively mutating a relatively small set of key residues makes this protein engineering approach very attractive for catalyst development.</p><p>To help future engineering of P450BM3 biocatalysts for other transformations, we label privileged active-site residues of P450BM3 in Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>, whose mutation resulted in substantial improvements in previously developed carbene and nitrene transfer enzymes. Beneficial mutations will of course also lie at more distant residues, as is often found in directed evolution campaigns.

Thus, one might ask why these new-to-nature enzymatic carbene transfer and nitrene transfer activities were achieved so easily. In retrospect, several factors may have played important roles (in addition to the inherent catalytic promiscuity of heme and heme proteins, which enabled improvement using reliable directed evolution approaches). First, the generation of Fe carbene and Fe nitrene is highly exergonic. Unlike the generation of compound I in native oxygenation reactions, the formation of Fe carbene and Fe nitrene is likely kinetically facile and does not require complex interactions with the protein scaffold. Second, the nascent iron carbene and iron nitrene are highly active, allowing for both bimolecular and unimolecular reactions to occur rapidly at ambient temperature. Based on these considerations, we propose that reaction rate (k cat ) is more important than substrate binding (K M ) for the initial development of new-to-nature reactions.</p><p>Third, despite the highly active nature of iron carbene and nitrene intermediates, their synthetic precursors including diazo compounds and organic azides are relatively stable under physiological conditions, even in living cells. This bioorthogonality limits the spontaneous decay of substrates and ensures the productivity of enzymatic chemistry. Fourth, the excellent evolvability of heme proteins dramatically accelerated engineering campaigns. Last but not least, numerous ideas taken straight from synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry guided our design of new-to-nature biocatalytic processes. Standing on the shoulders of giants, we saw great opportunities at the colliding fields of synthetic chemistry and protein engineering.</p><p>We anticipate that the strategies underlying the work detailed in this Account will lead to the development of yet more enzymes for challenging transformations. After all, the astonishing structural and functional diversity of naturally available enzymes, and other proteins, will continue to provide exciting opportunities for catalyst discovery. Using an interdisciplinary approach combining genome mining, enzymology, protein engineering, and synthetic organic chemistry, a broader range of new-to-nature biocatalytic transformations is yet to come. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Scheme 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Scheme 1.
