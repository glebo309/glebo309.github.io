  "_abstract": "Several biologically active esters of castanospermine [( lS,6&7R$R,8aR)-1,6,7,8-tetrahydroxyotahydroindolizine] have been synthesized on a preparative scale in pyridine by using the proteolytic enzyme subtilisin as a catalyst. Under these conditions, subtilisin possesses a high regioselectivity and at the same time a broad substrate specificity and enantioselectivity. This fact makes possible the synthesis of a wide variety of I-0-acyl derivatives via castanospermine esterification. It is possible to regulate the hydrophobicity of the acylating group (acetyl, butyryl, octanoyl)  or to incorporate an aromatic moiety (phenylacetyl) or L and D amino acids (phenylalanyl, L-and D-ahyl). Since 1 -esters of castanospermine are soluble in several organic solvents, they have been employed as intermediates in the preparation of diesters. Porcine pancreatic lipase, lipase from Chromobacterium uiscosum, and subtilisin have been used as catalysts for further enzymatic acylation of 1 -0-acyl derivat"
