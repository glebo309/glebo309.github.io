<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Sponges have been shown to be a rich source of bioactive molecules, including halometabolites, and an exciting treasure trove in which to search for new enzymes. Halogenation represents an important strategy for tuning and improving bioavailability and bioactivity of molecules, and is attracting increasing interest from academia and industry alike. Over 4000 halogenated natural products have been identified to date, many of which exhibit potent bioactivities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Keramamides and related compounds (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>) are a unique series of halogenated marine non-ribosomal peptide natural products that have been shown to be cytotoxic against murine and human cancer cell lines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Due to conferring favorable properties, halogenation is used prolifically by both agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries, with around 20% of small molecule drugs and 30% of agrochemical compounds being halogenated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> In 2013, the top-revenue drug in the USA was the 2,3dichlorophenyl-containing antipsychotic aripiprazole (Abilify). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Furthermore, the introduction of halogens into molecules can provide sites for selective functionalization through cross-coupling chemistries. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Synthetic conditions for halogenation are often harsh and non-regioselective, utilize noxious reagents, or generate undesirable by-products <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> and there is an increasing demand for the discovery and development of halogenases as new tools for (bio-)catalysis. In contrast to synthetic approaches, halogenases are able to regioselectively introduce halogens under mild and green conditions without generating harmful waste. As a result, halogenases are attracting much attention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> Symbiont-derived natural products containing the halo-hydroxytryptophan motif (highlighted in blue) that have been identified from extracts of T. swinhoei chemotypes. Two distinct halohydroxytryptophan motifs are observed: 2bromo-5-hydroxytryptophan and 6-chloro-5hydroxytryptophan. Keramamide H (1), keramamide A (2), konbamide (3), orbiculamide A (4).! Keramamides contain rare halohydroxytryptophans motifs. Notably, the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei has been identified as the source of several natural products that contain this moiety, including konbamide, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and orbiculamide <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> (e.g., 1-4, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>) as well as the keramamides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Intriguingly, distinct variants of these compounds occur in different chemotypes of the sponge. Orbiculamide A (4) (containing a 2-bromo-5hydroxytryptophan moiety) is found in the chemotype T. swinhoei Y, which is named to reflect the characteristic yellow color of the sponge interior (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> T. swinhoei chemotype WA (white interior from Hachijo Island, Japan) was not previously reported to contain such peptidic natural products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>A new krm gene cluster from T. swinhoei WA By identifying the biosynthetic genes, it was recently demonstrated that keramamide-type peptides and many other natural products isolated from T. swinhoei Y are produced by an as-yet-uncultured bacterial symbiont of the sponge, Candidatus 'Entotheonella factor' TSY1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> The sponge T. swinhoei WA examined in the current study was also previously shown to contain filamentous 'Entotheonella' symbionts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> In this sponge, 'Entotheonella serta' TSWA1 is the source of the homodimeric polyketide actin inhibitor misakinolide A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> Here, using an enriched 'Entotheonella' cell fraction prepared from T. swinhoei WA, PCR analysis with primers specific for adenylation (A) domain-encoding regions of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes revealed the presence of homologous genes. These were closely related to those of the keramamide (ker) biosynthetic genes previously identified in 'E. factor' associated with T. swinhoei Y. To isolate the corresponding genomic locus, a fosmid library was constructed from the enriched 'Entotheonella' cell fraction of the WA chemotype and screened, resulting in the isolation of fosmid pADU2a. Sequencing of his fosmid confirmed the presence of NRPS and polyketide synthase (PKS) genes sharing high similarity and architectural features with the ker cluster (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Notable differences of the krm biosynthetic gene cluster to the ker system, included krmR, and krmI. Keramamides identified from T. swinhoei WA exhibit an Omethylserine extension as present in keramamide H (1, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), and krmR is predicted to encode an NRPS module activating and incorporating O-methylserine. The C-terminal region of KrmI resembles flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases (FDTHs). FDHs are typically found encoded within a natural product biosynthetic pathway gene cluster, and many are known to halogenate indole, phenol, and pyrrole motifs. Though halotryptophans occur fairly frequently in natural products, such halohydroxytryptophans are far less common.</p><p>Challenged by the low concentration of keramamides in the sponge tissue, which is itself of limited availability, and the current unculturable nature of 'Entotheonella' from either T. swinhoei WA or Y1, we set out to use comparative MS analysis to analyze the chemistry produced by the sponge microbiomes and to glean evidence for the activity of the newly identified krm gene cluster. Strikingly, our analysis revealed the presence of numerous keramamide congeners from each system. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref> show a molecular network analysis of extracts from both chemotypes. Whilst the MS 2 characteristics of some T. swinhoei WA compounds matched those of known keramamides, others are unique and observed for the first time.  <ref type="table">S1</ref> for further information on the genes identified in the krm pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> )</p><p>The detection of more than a dozen different keramamide congeners in both chemotypes might indicate an inherent flexibility of the krm-encoded adenylation domains, often observed for NRPS pathways, which seem to accept series of similar amino acids. From the comparative MS network analysis, the position of halogenation cannot be determined Challenged by the limited amounts of material available, as NMR analysis of the WA keramamides would not be a possible method for us to determine the regiochemistry of the halogenation, we next set out to directly investigate the unusual associated halogenase KrmI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bioinformatic analysis of krmI</head><p>Bioinformatic analysis of the gene krmI at the translated amino acid level using BLAST <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> and HHPred <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> (SI Tables <ref type="table">S2</ref> and <ref type="table">S3</ref>) indicated that the C-terminus of the protein KrmI is homologous to known halogenases including RebH (30% identity, 48% similarity over homologous region), PrnA (30% / 47%), and CmdE (21% / 35%), and contains the wellcharacterized sequence motifs for FDTHs -GxGxxG and WxWxIP -as well as mechanistically relevant residues (Lys443 and Glu696 align to Lys79 and Glu346 from PrnA) (SI figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> Unusually, KrmI appears to include a second, N-terminal domain-like region with distant homology to members of the ThiF enzyme family (Pfam family ThiF PF00899). Typically, these enzymes utilize ATP to activate carboxylic acids by adenylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Whilst sequence identity to characterized protein sequences is low, the alignment revealed that in KrmI, this domain is truncated and the majority of residues involved in substrate and cofactor binding are likely to be absent, although we must be cautious making definite claims based on alignments of such distantly related proteins. Only one other sequence displaying this unusual combination of truncated ThiF-like and FDTH domains has been deposited in the NCBI nonredundant protein sequence database; this hypothetical protein is uncharacterized and no information on the context of this gene is available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> The ThiF family is similar to the E1-like proteins that have been implicated in the specific binding of peptide substrates in ribosomal peptide natural product biosynthesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and it is possible that the Cterminal domain serves a similar function here. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Production of KrmI</head><p>To determine whether krmI encodes an active halogenase, and whether both domains are necessary for activity, two expression constructs were prepared. The first encoded the full-length gene, whilst the second encoded only the Cterminal domain (truncated to the first in-frame ATG codon preceding the FDTH domain). Both constructs produced little soluble protein when expressed in Escherichia coli unless the chaperone proteins GroEL/S, DnaK/J and GrpE were coexpressed. Though the production of many other halogenases in heterologous expression hosts do not require the use of chaperones; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> chaperones GroEL/S has previously been reported to improve the solubility and yield of RebH when produced in E. coli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Coexpression of genes encoding GroEL/S, DnaK/J and GrpE along with KrmI resulted in adequate levels of production of soluble KrmI (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S6</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>). Attempts to produce either protein as an N-terminal maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion resulted in complete loss of solubility, whilst the presence of a polyhistidine tag at either terminus had only a slightly detrimental effect on solubility. A significant proportion of the soluble protein did not bind to nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (NiNTA) resin during immobilized metal affinity purification (IMAC), indicating that the polyhistidine tag may have low accessibility. IMAC purification of this enzyme is low-yielding (approximately 1 mg protein per L E. coli culture). We demonstrated, however, that the crude cell lysate (CCL) containing KrmI could be readily utilized as a biocatalyst, without any detrimental effect on the reaction, and therefore KrmI was used as a component of the CCL throughout the majority of the work reported here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Halogenation assays &amp; product characterization</head><p>The gene was shown to encode a functional halogenase as in vitro assays demonstrated that the full-length protein was able to convert 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP, 5) to a single new product when the enzyme was utilized as a component of a CCL (Scheme 1). LC-HRMS was used to identify the accurate mass of this product, suggesting a chemical formula of  Exclusively in the case of the full-length purified protein, it was possible to restore activity by supplementing with either a CCL prepared from E. coli expressing an empty vector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>) or with catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>), implying that the protein may be harmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in situ. Other FDTHs reported in the literature have been active upon purification without the need for the inclusion of any further additives to counter the effect of ROS. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> In order to fully characterize the product and identify the regiochemistry of halogenation, the reaction was scaled up to 10 mg, which allowed the product to be purified and analyzed by 1 H NMR. As the aromatic region of the 1 H and COSY NMR spectra were devoid of coupling, it could be concluded that halogenation has taken place at position 6 and the three observed singlet aromatic resonances correspond to the protons at positions 2, 4, and 7 of the indole ring. 6chloro-5-hydroxytryptophan (6Cl5HTP) has previously been described in the literature, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and the 1 H NMR characterization agrees with that reported here. The single product generated by the KrmI-catalyzed regioselective chlorination of 5HTP (5) was therefore confirmed as 6Cl5HTP (6) (Scheme 1), a likely biosynthetic precursor to keramamide A (2) and other congeners.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Halide and substrate scope</head><p>Having determined that KrmI is able to chlorinate 5HTP, we next sought to explore whether it could also catalyze bromination or iodination of the same substrate. As the enzyme was used in the form of a CCL, it was not practical to completely eliminate endogenous sodium chloride from the preparation; however, we found that the enzyme was able to tolerate the addition of salt to the CCL. Therefore, we performed assays in the presence of additional sodium chloride, sodium bromide, and potassium iodide. As is typical for FDTH, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> KrmI is able to utilize chloride and bromide but not iodide, with reduced activity when incorporating bromide (Figures <ref type="figure">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>. UPLC chromatograms (UV absorbance at 300 nm) monitoring the products of 5HTP (5) halogenation by KrmI in the presence of NaCl (A), NaBr (B), and KI (C). A small amount of NaCl is present in all assays, leading to the production of 6Cl5HTP. In the presence of bromide, an additional new product is formed, which was determined to be 6Br5HTP. N H NH 2 COOH HO Cl 6Cl5HTP (6) N H NH 2 COOH HO 5HTP (5) N H NH 2 COOH HO Br 6Br5HTP (7)</p><p>The brominated product was isolated from a scaled-up reaction and characterized by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> H NMR, which indicated that regioselectivity had been retained and the product was 6bromo-5-hydroxytryptophan (6Br5HTP). By combining sodium bromide and sodium chloride in varying ratios in the assay, we were able to determine that bromination occurred in preference to chlorination despite chloride being present in higher concentrations and a decrease in overall conversion of the starting material (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</p><p>FDTH are known to halogenate a range of substrates, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> typically tryptophan derivatives and other aromatic moieties.</p><p>To initiate a study of the substrate scope for this unusual halogenase we first explored whether the enzyme might halogenate tryptophan and serotonin, as they are closely related to 5HTP. Indeed, KrmI was able to halogenate serotonin and 5HTP with approximately equal efficiency in terms of time and conversion levels, whilst tryptophan was less well tolerated as a substrate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). To our knowledge, the only other FDTH with a preference for a substituted tryptophan is KtzR, which installs chlorine at the 6-position of 7-chlorotryptophan in the biosynthesis of kutzneride. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Encouraged by these initial results, we extended our study of the substrate scope of KrmI. Again we utilized crude lysate containing the full-length protein in incubations with a variety of potential substrates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). We observed good levels of conversion for the substrates L-5HTP (5), serotonin (10), and 5-methoxyindole (18); and lower levels of conversion for L-tryptophan (8), D-tryptophan ( <ref type="formula">12</ref>) and 5aminoindole (19). We determined that L-7-fluorotryptophan (13), L-7-hydroxytryptophan ( <ref type="formula">14</ref>), 4-hydroxyindole (15), 5hydroxyindole ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (17), 5formylindole (20), and 7-azaindole (21) could also be processed by KrmI, but at trace level as indicated by LC-MS measurements. All substrates were converted to a single new mono-chlorinated product, with the exception of 5aminoindole (19), which was converted into two halogenated products (LC-HRMS analysis of all halogenated substrates is included in the SI). This indicates that KrmI is able to regioselectively halogenate a range of substrates, although due to low levels of product, the position of halogenation has not been confirmed in all cases. The acceptance of 5hydroxyindole ( <ref type="formula">16</ref>), 5-methoxyindole (18) and 5aminoindole (19) but not of 5-fluoroindole (30) or 5fluorotryptophan (generated in situ from 30) may suggest that specificity within the active site could arise from the requirement for a hydrogen bond acceptor within the ring, rather than steric requirements, as 5-fluorotryptophan is isosteric to the preferred substrate 5HTP. There is clearly considerable substrate flexibility as 5-formylindole (20) and 4-hydroxyindole (15)  were also accepted. The accommodation of both L-and D-tryptophan (8 and 12)  demonstrates that this hydrogen bonding interaction is not an absolute requirement, and that interactions with the amino acid moiety are flexible. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Through metabolite extraction and MS network analysis we show that T. swinhoei WA (white chemotype), like its yellow counterpart, T. swinhoei Y produces keramamides. Whilst the keramamide series of compounds produced by T. swinhoei WA and Y partially overlap, they also show distinct chemotype-specific characteristics. The discovery of the new biosynthetic gene cluster (e.g. krmI) from the metagenome of the sponge T. swinhoei WA explains the difference in the suites of compounds produced in each system. The krm genes, though showing homology to the previously identified ker gene cluster, exhibit distinct differences; a key difference is the presence of krmI. Biooinformatic analysis of krmI indicated it to be a flavin-dependent halogenase. Functional analysis of the encoded protein product, revealed a catalytically active halogenase with an in vitro substrate preference for 5-hydroxytryptophan over tryptophan, generating 6-halo-5-hydroxytryptophan as a single regioisomer, indicating that this halogenase operates to generate the 6-halo containing keramamides. It is likely that a second, as yet unidentified halogenase acts to generate the  KrmI is the first halogenase identified to use L-5hydroxytryptophan as its preferred substrate. Furthermore another unique characteristic is the unusual N-terminal region of the protein. Though no function has been assigned to the N-terminal domain, in our hands, the mono-domain truncation demonstrated considerably lower activity compared to its full-length counterpart. Our initial investigations of KrmI as a potential tool for biocatalysis demonstrate that it has promisingly broad substrate specificity. KrmI can accommodate a range of indole-derived substrates. Future work will include crystallographic analysis which may provide insight into substrate flexibility and informed engineering of the enzyme to further develop it for biotechnological applications. KrmI is an efficient catalyst for the production of halogenated 5HTP and serotonin, and due to its inherent substrate flexibility presents a promising starting point for the generation of a range of chlorinated and brominated products following protein engineering.</p><p>It is notable that halogenation was almost exclusively observed at the 6-position of the indole ring in these studies, whilst in the keramamide congeners halogenation is observed at both the 2-and the 6-positions. It seems likely, therefore, that there is either another halogenase in the keramamide gene clusters that is responsible for halogenation at the 2position of the indole ring, or KrmI possesses an activity in vivo which is not observed in vitro. It is tempting to postulate that the C-terminal domain may be responsible to binding a peptide substrate, and that the true activity of KrmI would not be observed when the enzyme acts on a free amino acid substrate rather than a peptide substrate. The instability of 2halotryptophans, in which loss of halogen is promoted by the free carboxylate or even amine positioning over the indole ring <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> makes it likely that halogenation at the 2-position does not occur on free tryptophan substrates. Such halogenation is more likely to occur once the tryptophan substrate is integrated into a peptide, where both N-and Ctermini are functionalized as amides.</p><p>This study adds further functional evidence to the role of symbiotic bacteria in the production of sponge-derived natural products. Whilst keramamides have previously been assigned to 'E. factor' in the chemotype T. swinhoei Y, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> the source of the halogenated congeners in T. swinhoei WA remains unknown. In another study of the WA chemotype, the polyketide misakinolide A was assigned to the symbiont 'E. serta' TSWA1 by single-cell genome sequencing; 18 however, analysis of that sequence data did not reveal the presence of keramamide genes, suggesting that these compounds are likely to be produced by either a different 'Entotheonella' phylotype or another symbiotic bacterium found in the sponge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>Isolation of krm genes from the metagenome of T. swinhoei WA DNA was isolated from a previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> 'Entotheonella'-enriched bacterial fraction of T. swinhoei WA following a procedure adapted from Syn and Swarup. PCR using degenerate primers was used to amplify gene fragments corresponding to NRPS A domains, which were purified, ligated into pBlueScript II (SK-) (Stratagene) and sequenced. A second round of PCR using specific primers enabled identification of the fosmid pADU2a containing the krm cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metabolic analysis</head><p>Metabolites were extracted from T. swinhoei Y and WA tissue samples and analyzed by LC-MS-MS using a Thermo QExactive mass spectrometer operating in positive ionization mode and using data-dependent acquisition of fragmentation spectra. This data was processed using the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking web server (<ref type="url" target="www.gnps.ucsd.edu">www.gnps.ucsd.edu</ref>). Novel keramamide analogues were assigned based on spectral similarity to known keramamide analogues.</p><p>Vector preparation A PCR product containing krmI and appropriate restriction sites was ligated into a vector derived from pET21a using standard techniques. The sequence of vectors was confirmed by restriction digest and sequencing.</p><p>Protein production E. coli BL21-DE3, expressing chaperone genes from the plasmid pG-KJE8 (TaKaRa Bio) was transformed with the vector encoding KrmI. An overnight culture of this was used to inoculate LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics and chaperone inducers. This was grown at 37 °C to an OD of 0.6, then cooled to 16 °C and induced by addition of IPTG. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The crude lysate was clarified by centrifugation. The protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, eluting with imidazole. Proteins were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to standard methods. Halogenation assays Assays containing purified KrmI or CCL containing KrmI along with PrnF, FAD, substrate, NaCl, and NADH, (optionally also superoxide dismutase and catalase) in a final volume of 0.1 mL, were incubated at 28 °C for 90 minutes then quenched by addition of acidic methanol. Samples were analyzed by UPLC or LCMS. For preparation of purified substrates, the assays were scaled up to 10 mL and purified by semi-preparative HPLC.</p></div>
