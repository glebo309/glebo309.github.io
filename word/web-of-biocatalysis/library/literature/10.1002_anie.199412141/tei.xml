Of course. it has been displaced as a routine synthetic procedure with the advent of automated chemical synthesis (which still uses the methoxytrityl protecting group) with nucleoside-3' phosphoroamidites as the key intermediate^.['^ -2 s 1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Studies on Oligonucleotide Double Helix Stability and Specificity</head><p>In 1968 planned studies on the biosynthesis of salmonid prot-aminer261 and on the sequence of dA,dT-rich crab DNAcz7] became impossible for personal or for technical reasons. Casting around for a new project, I suggested to Caroline Astell. who was studying for her Ph.D, a series of model studies with chemically synthesized oligonucleotides directed at defining the stability and specificity of oligonucleotide duplexes of defined sequence. The objective was to see if a synthetically accessible oligonucleotide could be a tool for identifying and isolating a specific messenger RNA based on Watson -Crick hydrogen bonding. From the statistical point of view it should be possible, since the length required of an oligonucleotide in order for it to be unique in a given genome size ranges from 9 nucleotides for h phages with a genome of 4.6 x lo4 base pairs to 18 for the higher plants, such as A . cepa with a genome of 1.5 x 10'" base pairs (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Also relevant was the work of Michelson and Monny["' and of Niyogi and Thomasr291 on interactions of ribooligonucleotides with ribopolynucleotides. which indicated that stable double helices can be formed with as few as seven base pairs and. equally importantly, which demonstrated that</p><p>Table I .

[ ' ~~ However, although data was available on duplex stability involving mixtures of oligonucleotides of defined length with DNA,[33, 341 there was I 70!</p><p>no systematic data obtained with pure oligonucleotides of defined sequence and length.</p><p>Our approach was to prepare deoxyribooligonucleotide celluloses by using simple oligonucleotides of defined length and sequence synthesized by the Khorana method and to employ these oligonucleotide celluloses, in the form of thermally eluted columns, to establish the stability of duplexes with a variety of complementary, or partially complementary, deoxyribo-and ribooligon~cleotides.[~ -381 The results and conclusions of this time-consuming but critical series of experiments has been summarized in more detail and only some highlights will be discussed here.</p><p>First, it was clear that, under appropriate conditions of ionic strength, stable duplexes containing as few as six dA-dT base pairs can be formed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). Further, additional base pairs increase duplex stability significantly, but in a nonlinear manner; the incremental increase in stability diminishes with increased length. Also, a single base-pair mismatch of dT with dT or of dT with d G decreases duplex stability by the same amount (equivalent to removing about two base pairs), but duplex formation is still possible at low temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>). In addition, it was obvious that oligonucleotide duplexes form rapidly at low temperatures, conditions under which denatured double-strand D N A does not reanneal. These experiments convinced me that it would be possible to use a synthetic oligonucleotide to identify an R N A or a DNA containing the exact Watson-Crick complement of its sequence and to differentiate it from similar but not identical sequences. An opportunity to demonstrate this principle was provided by mutants in the lysozyme-encoding locus of phage T4.[40' Also, at a later date, the data made me realize that it should be possible to use short synthetic deoxyribooligonucleotides as specific mutagens and to differentiate between a point mutant and wildtype DNA.</p><p>Experiments on the interaction of deoxyribooligonucleotide celluloses and ribooligonucleotides confirmed the results of earlier studies on the relative stabilities of DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA double strand^.'^^.^^^ They also demon-  base pair is relatively stable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). Differences in the stability of dT. d G and dT, rG base pairs (compare Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), presumably, reflect differences in the base pairing allowed in the B forms and the A forms of double helix.[4z1 The observation has two practical implications. First. the most specific and stringent interaction of an oligonucleotide probe will be the one between a deoxyribooligonucleotide and DNA. Second, one cannot assume that duplex structures that are formed by RNA will be formed by DNA or by deoxyribooligonucleotides. In connection with this. I have always been puzzled by the widespread acceptance of the idea that deoxyinosine is precocious in base pairing because inosine behaves in a precocious manner in tRNA duplex interactions. Studies on deoxyinosine. in fact, indicate that it fLinctions as a specific analog of deoxyguanosine, although it does not self-aggregate as does deoxyguanosine.r'. 8,421 30i N,' __c The above empirical studies and related ones not discussed here[391 provided the direct inspiration for and commitment to our use of synthetic deoxyribooligonucleotides as probes for isolation of specific DNA fragments, as primers for the direct sequencing of double-stranded DNA, a 5 primers for precise definition of the ends of mRNAs, as specific mutagens, and as tools for the identification and isolation of point mutations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deoxyribooligonucleotides as DNA Probes</head><p>When the model studies described in the foregoing section were commenced, in 1968, the intent was to develop a method for isolation of specific mRNAs by affinity chromatography. However, the development of the full panoply of DNA cloning techniques in the early 1970s["] made it clear that the prime target for work with synthetic deoxyribooligonucleotides should be a method for monitoring gene isolation. Discussions with Dr. Benjamin D. Hall made me aware of the important studies of F. Sherman on double-frameshift mutants of yeast cytochrome ~,.[""l Knowledge of the amino acid sequence of these mutants allowed the unambiguous prediction of the N-terminal coding sequence and, hence. provided a specific target for an oligonucleotide of defined sequence. A second attractive feature about a yeast gene as a first target was the fact that the length of oligonucleotide required for a specific probe (13 nucleotides. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> )was close to the limit for our enzymatic method of synthesis.['". r 1 . 2 2 1 The required probe was synthesized by means of the enzymatic method'"'] and was used to isolate the gene, albeit with some difficulty.["h1 thus clearly validating the principle that a synthetic oligonucleotide could function as a probe for gene isolation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequencing Double-Stranded DNA with Oligonucleotide Primers</head><p>At the time when the iso-I-cytochrome c gene was isolated, the chemical method for DNA sequence determination[""] and the chain terminating enzymatic method[501 had newly been developed: the former is applicable to double-stranded DNA and the latter to single-stranded DNA. The sequences of the ends of the Eco RI-Hind 111 DNA fragment containing the cytochrome c coding sequence were obtained by the chemical method.["'] Based on my conviction that an oligonucleotide should hybridize ur loit, retnperuturr with a complementary DNA strand of a denatured DNA double helix in solution, even though the second DNA strand was present and capable of producing a thermodynamically much more stable structure, I decided to investigate the possibility of directly sequencing double-stranded DNA by the enzymatic method with synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The critical question was whether the second DNA strand would displace a short oligonucleotide from a complex with the complementary DNA strand under the conditions of the Sanger enzymatic sequencing method.[s Thc first experiment was completely successful, an enormously excit-</p></div>

"walking" along the sequence with a series of short oligonucleotide primers nine or ten nucleotides in length.[521 I believe that the full potential of this approach to gene sequencing has yet to be realized.</p><p>Another important application of oligonucleotide-primed sequencing of double-stranded DNA is the precise identification of point mutations produced by classical genetic techniques at a given locus. A particular good example was in the analysis of a large number of independently isolated point mutations in a yeast suppressor tRNA gene.r53. 541</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining the Ends of mRNAs Precisely</head><p>It is important to define the sequences at the 5'and 3'-ends of mRNAs exactly. For the 3'-end of an mRNA, this can be done by oligonucleotide-primed sequencing with reverse transcriptase for the Sanger sequencing method with RNA enriched for the desired mRNA as template. The family of 12 deoxyribooligonucleotides consisting of a tract of dT residues terminated at the 3'-end by two other deoxyribonucleotides can be annealed to the 3'-end of polyladenylated eukaryotic mRNA. If the transcribed sequence has a unique 3'-end, only one of the twelve oligonucleotides should act as a specific primer. This strategy was used to define the sequence of the unique 3'-end of bovine growth hormone mRNA[551 and to demonstrate and precisely define the microheterogeneity at the 3'-end of the bovine prolactin niRNA transcript.[561 The iso-I -cytochrome c proved to have a unique 3'-end,[571 while the 5'-end of the same mRNA is very disperse indeed. as was shown by oligonucleotide primed extension using the mRNA as template.[581 There are no other methods for defining the 5'and 3'-ends of mRNAs with this precision. ii degree of precision that is essential to the accurate definition of transcription initiation and termination sigilals.[5'.</p></div>

J. Lederbergihol Initiation of the project to isolate the yeast cytochrome c gene made me realize that 1 needed to learn about D N A sequence determination. I was lucky to be able to spend a year, starting in the fall of 1975, in Fred Sanger's laboratory working with the "plus-minus'' sequencing method as part of the team that was attacking the sequence of the E. coli phage @X174. <ref type="bibr">[6'.621</ref> There are three pairs of overlapping genes in the 5386 nucleotide All genes are encoded on the same DNA strand, and each overlapping pair uses different codon reading frames. An essential integral component of defining the position and reading frame of these genes was the availability of nonsense mutants suppressible by amber or ochre suppressors. This use of precisely located mutants of a particular phenotype highlighted the need for a very specific mutagenic method that would define the target to a specific base pair in the genome and introduce a predetermined change with sufficiently high efficiency to allow genomic screening in order to identify phenotypically silent mutants. Since the DNA of phage @XI 74 is single stranded and the complete sequence of its genome was known from our earlier studies, the demonstration that small oligonucleotides as short as seven nucleotides in length could form stable duplexes at low temperature even with a mismatch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) suggested that oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis should be possible. There was additional useful information : Point mutants can be reverted, albeit with low efficiency, by annealing mutant phage @XI74 D N A with fragments from the complementary strand of wildtype D N A prior to transfection.[66. 671 However, fragments very much longer than those that we could readily synthesize were needed. and the low efficiency precluded genotypic screening.[". 671 In discussing these issues, Clyde Hutchison (who. also was spending one year in Fred Sanger's group and whose biological knowledge of @XI74 was invaluable to the sequencing project) and I realized that the studies of Kornberg and Gouprovided an obvious route to a mutagenic method, since they had demonstrated that an oligonucleotide as short as nine nucleotides in length could act as a primer for E. coli DNA polymerase I on a circular single-strand template, and that the product could be converted into a closed circular duplex by enzymatic ligation. It was also known that most of the primer molecule is excised from the product,[721 presumably due to the 5'-exonuclease activity of E. coli DNA polymerase I,["] With this information and our knowledge that the stability of duplexes involves a mismatched oligonucleotide, we decided to use a 12 nucleotide oligomer, with a centrally positioned single nucleotide mismatch, as primer and with (DX 174 DNA as template and E. coli D N A polymerase I in which the 5'-exonuclease had been inactivated by subtilisin <ref type="bibr">[73 751</ref> to construct a closed. circular, double-stranded DNA with the oligonucleotide in one strand.

This was increased to a very encouraging level of about 3 5 ' / o after removal of incompletely closed duplexes by adsorption to nitrocellulose or treatment with a singlestrand specific nuclease under conditions in which a single basepair mismatch was not degraded.[761 Further studies directed at optimizing the mutagenic conditions resulted in efficiencies of up to 39 YO with a 12 nucleotide mutagenic primer and significant mutation with a heptamer mutagenic primer.[771 The wisdom of using subtilisin-treated DNA polymerase is evident from comparison of these results with those of another study which employed intact E. coli DNA polymerase I.[''] lian, <ref type="bibr">[43.</ref>  Further studies on the mutagenesis of phage (DX174 demonstrated that, in addition to the two transition mutations of the first experiments, it was possible to produce transversion mutations and single nucleotide deletions, also by using very short oligonucleotide^.[^^] Clearly, the method was highly specific, efficient, and general within the context of the genome of QX174. It was time to generalize the method further so that it could be applied to any cloned fragment of DNA. The icosahedral bacteriophages, such as QX174, are not potential vectors for recombinant DNA because the amount of DNA that can be accommodated in the viral particle is limited. The filamentous bacteriophages, on the other hand, can accommodate additional DNA incorporated into the genome. At the time when Mark Zoller and I were planning the generalization of the method, there were those that argued in favor of a methodology applied to double-stranded recombinant plasmids. It seemed to us that the biology of a filamentous bacteriophage, which produces single-stranded, circular DNA and then purifies it as phage particles, argued overpoweringly in favor of phage DNA as vector. Subsequent developments in recombinant phage biology and in the construction of phagemids". ' I have vindicated this strategic decision, although viable procedures for plasmid mutagenesis are available.[8n "I Oligonucleotide mutagenesis with filamentous phage DNA as template proved to be more difficult than with QX174 DNA, presumably because of a greater degree of secondary structure that inhibited the production of fulllength, double-stranded circles. Consequently, new procedures for enhancing the efficiency of the mutagenic procedure had to be d e ~e l o p e d . [ ' ~-' ~~</p><p>The power of the methodology was graphically illustrated by our first involvement in protein engineering in collaboration with Greg Winter and Alan Fersht.la7I This, of course, presaged the enormous use of the methodology in protein structure-function analysis that has become a feature of modern biochemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genotypic Selection or Screening for Mutants</head><p>Because the immediate product of the enzymatic incorporation of a mutagenic oligonucleotide into a double-stranded recombinant DNA is a heteroduplex, biological replication of the D N A will produce mutated and unmutated progeny DNAs, providing there is no asymmetry in the mechanism of DNA replication or providing there is not an asymmetric mismatchrepair mechanism. In fact, it is possible to achieve mutagenic efficiencies of close to 50% by using standard procedures[77. 8 5 1 With this level of efficiency, screening by DNA sequence determination is the most effective procedure for detecting the desired mutant DNA. However, often the yield of mutant is considerably less than 50%. It is my opinion that the predominant reason for this is the use of template D N A that is contaminated with random oligonucleotides resulting from bacterial DNA degradation; others ascribe it to biological mismatch-repair favoring the sequence of the template DNA.[801 Whatever the cause of the reduced yield of mutant, procedures other than sequence determination are required for mutant identification. The ones that are available fall into two categories: those using the mutagenic oligonucleotide as a tool for identifying mutant DNA and those which select for progeny derived from the newly synthesized, oligonucleotide-containing DNA strand.</p><p>The significantly enhanced stability of a perfectly matched oligonucleotide duplex relative to one with a mismatch (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>) suggested that a mutagenic oligonucleotide should be able to identify mutant complementary DNA. This principle was used to develop a method for selection of mutant DNA. In this procedure the mixture of wild-type and mutant singlestranded phage DNA produced by oligonucleotide mutagenesis acts as a template for double-stranded DNA synthesis with the mutagenic oligonucleotide as primer under conditions that should not form a mismatched duplex.[881 Following transfection into E. coli, this procedure can select mutant DNA with close to 100% efficiency.</p><p>An alternative procedure is to use the mutagenic oligonucleotide as a probe to screen for mutant DNA in plaques produced by E. coli with mutagenized phage. <ref type="bibr">[83.</ref> 841 Again, this procedure is very reliable in the identification of mutant DNA. The same principle is used in the identification of point mutations in human DNA[*'] where, of course, the complexity of the human genome requires a probe containing a minimum of 17 nucleotides (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>A number of procedures for selection of progeny derived from the DNA strand containing the mutagenic oligonucleotide have been developed.r8n1 Two of these, one based on in vivo selection and the other on in vitro selection have proved most popular and are widely used. In vivo selection involves a template DNA in which about 1 % of the deoxythymidine residues have been replaced by deoxyuridine residues. This template is incorporated into double-stranded DNA in which the mutagenic oligonucleotide is part of the in vitro synthesized second strand. On transfection of an appropriate E. coli host, the deoxyuridine strand is selectively degraded by the bacterium's DNA damage-repair system, resulting in progeny derived primarily from the mutant strand.[901 In vitro selection involves a normal recombinant phage template DNA with the mutagenic oligonucleotide incorporated in the second strand that contains enzymatically synthesized thiophosphate internucleotide linkages. These are resistant to cleavage by restriction endonuclease, which, as a consequence nicks the template. The nicked template is partially degraded with an exonuclease and then repaired by a D N A polymerase and D N A ligase. The result is a doublestranded DNA which, predominantly, is mutant in both strands and which produces, predominantly, mutant recombinant phage on transfection of E. ~o l i . ~~~~</p></div>

Clearly, many other applications of oligonucleotide in biology exist, notably the polymerase chain reaction['*] and its multitudinous variations, but also in doublestrand DNA synthesis and in the use of oligonucleotide probes in vitro and in vivo.

For the past ,four years I have been Scirntific Leader ofthe Canadian Protein Engineering Net-~~' o r k of Centres of E.xcellence, a country-wide collaboration on protein structure~function analysis. generous1.v. funded by the Network of Ceritrcs of E.welle?zce program. Finally, firstly at the British Columbia Research Council, then at the Fisheries Research Board of' Canada Vancouver Laboratory, most!,! in the Department of Biochemistry and more recently in ihr Biotechnology Laboratory, the canipus o f t k e University of British Columbia has been n y scientific home since 1956. I am very grateful fbr the environment that it has provided, especially in the Department of' Biochemistry where the studies described in this article were carried out.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc>[' I Prof. M.

HeJi'nished his Ph.D. there in 1956 with H . B. Henbest on cyclohexane diols and then joined the group of Gobincl Khorana in Vancouver, Canada, as Postdoctoral Fellow to work on biologically important organophosphates. In 1960 he moved with the group to the Institute for Enzyme Research at the University of Wisumsin and worked on the synthesis ofribooligonucleotides. In 1961 he accepted apost at the Fischerirs Research Board of Canada Laboratory in the grounds of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. He was awarded the position of Medical Research Associate of the Medical Research Council of Canada at this university in 1966. A new interdisciplinary Institute, the Biotechnology Laboratory, came into being in 1986 with his help. After a lzeaq. load oj administrative tasks recently, he is looking,forward to returning to the bench.</figDesc></figure>
