<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The benefits of applying biocatalysts to organic synthesis, such as their high chemo-, regio-, and enantio-specificity and selectivity, must be seriously considered, especially where chemical routes are unavailable, complex or prohibitively expensive. In cases where a potential biocatalytic route is not yet efficient enough to compete with chemical synthesis, directed evolution, and/or process engineering could be implemented for improvements. While directed evolution has demonstrated great potential to enhance enzyme properties, there will always be some aspects of biocatalytic processes that it does not address. Even where it can be successfully applied, the resources required for its implementation must currently be weighed against the feasibility of, and resources available for developing a chemical synthesis route. Here, we review the potential of combining directed evolution with process engineering, and recent developments to improve their implementation. Favourable targets for the directed evolution of new biocatalysts are the syntheses of highly complex molecules, especially where chemistry, metabolic engineering or recombineering provide a partial solution. We also review some of the recent advances in the application of these approaches alongside the directed evolution of biocatalysts.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Directed enzyme evolution and biocatalytic processes</head><p>While enzymes are potentially a very useful complement to the increasing range of chemical catalysts for the synthesis of complex chiral molecules, the process conditions in an industrial catalytic reactor are rarely ideally suited to maintaining a highly active and long lasting enzyme. Natural enzymes have evolved over millions of years to operate in a specific environment and despite their wide diversity, natural, and industrial environments are usually significantly different (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). In a recent paper, some of the ideal properties that would be required of an enzyme for an industrial process have been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and it is clear that environments appropriate to deliver such properties are not easily found in nature. In addition, enzyme chemistry in nature is rarely the most useful to assist in the synthesis of complex industrial products. These factors make the application of enzymes for industrial synthesis difficult, in particular, where multiple (rather than singular) traits need to be satisfied to create the ideal industrial enzyme catalyst. Nevertheless, there are very strong reasons for attempting to overcome these barriers, such as the exquisite chemo-, regio-, and stereo-selective and specific properties of enzymes and their ability for effective catalysis in water, under mild conditions.</p><p>One method of overcoming some of the barriers to implementing enzymes in industry is the application of directed evolution, in which the amino acid sequence of an enzyme is iteratively altered until the enzyme functions in the desired manner. Changing a protein by directed evolution opens the possibilities for moving towards a variety of required properties. The most popular targets for directed enzyme evolution to date have been activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, substrate specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, thermal and oxidative stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, enantio-selectivity or enantio-specificity ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, pH range <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and tolerance to solvent <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In many cases, directed evolution of an enzyme has enabled biocatalysis to reduce the number of steps required in an equivalent chemical or biocatalytic synthesis. Recent examples include the syntheses of 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA), shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, (S)-ketoprofen <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and both natural and unnatural sugar-1-phosphates for access to glycoconjugates <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. It is unlikely that all biocatalytic process targets can be achieved through directed evolution, although other techniques in which the process environment is changed may prove useful instead.</p><p>While directed evolution is a powerful method to overcome some of the limitations of biocatalysts, it can take considerable time to implement. On the other hand, improvements can be made through process techniques more rapidly, although they may be rather more modest (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Understanding this tradeoff will be key to the future rapid implementation of processes in this area. Ultimately, a combination of approaches will enable better implementation of effective biocatalytic processes. Some of the recent developments in these techniques are summarised in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>.</p><p>There are several other major aspects of biocatalytic processes that still largely need to be addressed by directed evolution. For example, the concentrations of substrates used in industrial chemical reactions are usually as high as possible to reduce costs, speed up reactions, and to improve product purification. The molar concentrations used in industrial chemical processes would frequently lead to toxic or inhibitory effects on a biocatalyst, or the accumulation of unwanted by-products. Directed evolution has the potential to reduce the effects of product inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> or by-product formation, and permit high process-intensity biocatalysis. Another factor to consider is the physico-chemical properties, including solubility and stability, of the substrates and products, which often dictate the conditions to be used in the bioreactor. These may be at odds with the enzyme (e.g. different pH optimum) and directed evolution may be used to alter the enzyme properties to match the conditions required in the reactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Finally, the requirement of redox enzymes for cofactors presents a major problem for using them in industrial biocatalysis as the cost of cofactor is prohibitive. While options are available for recycling cofactors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, directed evolution has been used previously to alter the cofactor requirement of Pseudomonas putida P450 from NADH to a much cheaper chemical alternative, hydrogen peroxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Table 1 Typical conditions in an industrial catalytic reactor Molar concentrations of reactant/product High salt concentrations Temperature and pH set by reactant/product stability Presence of gas-liquid interface Heterogeneity Fig. 1. Synthesis of 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) from adipyl-7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (adipyl-7-ADCA) using an evolved cephalosporin acylase. Directed evolution is typically used to target single enzyme traits, though a few examples of targeting multiple traits have been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. However, directed evolution in artificial conditions may not necessarily result in the desired enzyme for a real biocatalytic process, as it is well known that ''you get what you screen for'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. A typical biocatalytic process may include fermentation to produce the enzyme, immobilization of the enzyme, biocatalytic conversion, cofactor recycling, product removal and purification, and enzyme recycling. Research described in the following section is moving us towards the directed evolution of enzymes using screens that mimic entire process sequences in microtitre plates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Scale-down of whole biocatalytic processes</head><p>Defining the optimal biocatalyst-process combination and the establishment of process operation limits, frequently require more experimentation than is currently feasible in the time available <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Recent work in our laboratories and elsewhere has begun to establish the utility of microscale processing techniques to obtain key process design data using the minimum quantities of material at an early stage of development <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. These techniques are based on automated microtitre plate studies to rapidly perform large numbers of experiments in parallel.</p><p>Central to this approach is an understanding of how the data collected in microtitre plates on a recombinant biocatalyst can be used to predict its performance in a focused selection of larger scale pilot plant trials. This has led to studies on the fundamentals of shaken microtitre plate systems in order to define the engineering environment within individual wells with respect to mixing and oxygen transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In addition to providing a basis for scale-up this information also enables the conditions used in microtitre plates to resemble as closely as possible those that will ultimately be used in the final reactor. This has been shown to be critical in the case of oxidative bioconversions where kinetics determined under appropriate conditions at the 250 mL scale have been accurately reproduced at the 1 L scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and also used to direct industrial scale operations at 200 L. The need to control key physico-chemcial parameters such as pH during the evaluation of recombinant biocatalysts has also led to the design and implementation of systems for the measurement and control of pH in parallel microtitre plate fermentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>Ensuring that the conditions obtained within microtitre plates are as close as possible to those used in the final reactor is critical for evolving enzymes with the final desired properties. For example, to obtain an enzyme variant with improved stability under reaction conditions, a screen that simply measures the retained activity after incubation at high temperature may be insufficient. The resulting enzyme variant would be expected to have improved resistance to thermal inactivation, but it could still be prone to denaturation or inactivation in the bioreactor, as there are many factors that can affect enzyme stability besides its free energy of unfolding in water, including chemical modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, deamidation, and hydrolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, as well as exposure to air-liquid interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</p><p>Building on knowledge of the engineering fundamentals to more precisely define the environmental conditions, a key development in microscale processing has been the ability to perform whole sequences of operations in microtitre plate formats <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This opens-up the possibility to evolve or engineer enzymes or cellular biocatalysts, not just in terms of reaction rate and operational stability, but also the ease of biocatalyst separation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and subsequent product recovery. Given the complexity of biological catalysts it is not Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. Illustration of an automated microscale approach to the whole process evaluation of an E. coli library expressing an evolved Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase. The performance of each strain is evaluated in a linked sequence of operations including biocatalyst production, bioconversion of various substrates, cell removal by microfiltration, and finally product recovery.</p><p>surprising that changes in one, or a limited number of characteristics, can lead to unexpected changes in other properties that affect downstream processing steps and hence the overall yield of the process. For example, relatively minor modifications of polyketide pathways in S. erythraea by metabolic engineering, have led to changes in substrate uptake and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, unexpected by-product formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and alteration of hyphal morphology. Similarly, mutating an enzyme to improve a single trait, e.g. thermostability, can lead to a trade-off in another, e.g. solvent tolerance, though molecular breeding of a number of homologous naturally occuring enzymes has the potential to solve this problem, as has been shown with subtilisin <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. These process issues are an indirect consequence of the application of molecular evolution and engineering techniques and can have a significant impact on the overall process yield and productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Automated microscale processing techniques are now emerging as a means to enable the parallel and quantitative evaluation of both biocatalyst and process options as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">In-process screening of biocatalytic activities</head><p>Just as it is critical to ensure that the conditions in which an enzyme library is screened mimic the desired final conditions as closely as possible, it is also essential that the method use to monitor an enzyme property is sensitive, direct, non-invasive, and readily available. For example, fluorometric and colorimetric screens are the most sensitive and convenient to use; however, they are not available for most enzymes and also have a tendency to affect the reaction rate being observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. The chromophore, which would not be used in the final bioconversion, may affect substrate binding, substrate solubility, and the pH stability profile relative to the intended final substrate. Furthermore, chromogenic molecules and fluorophores are often inherently good leaving groups, and may be expected to increase reaction rates for lytic reactions.</p><p>The most non-invasive and generic screening tools include HPLC, gas-chromatography, NMR, mass spectrometry, and capillary electrophoresis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Despite their lower throughput, the development of these assays can be achieved much faster than a chromogenic one, and they can also yield a much greater quantity of useful information, such as the presence and identity of side-products, and the quantitation of both substrate and product simultaneously. Furthermore, work is underway to increase the throughput of these analytical tools. Schrader et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> described a highthroughput method for screening of enantioselective catalysts that uses an eight-channel multiplexed sprayer system connected to a time-of flight mass spectrometer. By applying this system they were able to screen ca. 10,000 catalysts per day.</p><p>Other techniques with potential for high throughput screening of chiral compounds are capillary array and microchip electrophoresis. Adaptation of a capillary array electrophoresis system designed for parallel DNA separations has enabled the high throughput (&gt;7000 samples per day) determination of the enantiomeric purity of fluorescently labeled chiral amines <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. A method for high-speed chiral separations has also been developed that uses a microchip electrophoresis instrument with UV detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, and is able to separate the enantiomers of 19 compounds in less than 1 min with high reproducibility. The integration of these high-throughput generic analytical techniques with the automated microscale processing approaches described earlier now offer the potential to evaluate the process performance of larger numbers of enzyme variants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Directed evolution methods</head><p>While many precedents have now been set to exemplify the potential applications of directed evolution, along with the emergence of generic tools for screening biocatalytic reactions and processes, its application in industry is still not widespread. The pressure to develop a working production process quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref> frequently results in the use of a more convenient chemical or biocatalytic process that is comparatively expensive or atom inefficient. There is clearly a need for directed evolution methods to be improved for their ease of use, and robustness so that they may gain wider acceptance as a tool in chemical synthesis.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> summarises the basis of each library construction technique in terms of the use of DNA digestion, DNA synthesis, ligation, PCR, and cell culture methods. A major obstacle in the construction of random mutagenesis libraries occurs during the insertion of the mutagenic DNA fragments into the host vector. This typically relies upon a ligation step that can require considerable effort to optimize <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. Furthermore, many of the resulting plasmids contain no inserts or multiple inserts, or have retained wild-type inserts. Attempts have been made to improve the efficiency and quality of ligations <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, though it is not clear that improvements are broadly applicable or whether each new case requires optimization. An alternative approach is to eliminate the ligation step by the use of mutator strains such as XL1-red (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). These bacterial strains are deficient in DNA repair mechanisms and permit mutations throughout a plasmid of interest to accumulate <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. However, allowing mutations to occur outside the gene of interest can lead to many unwanted sideeffects such as altered plasmid copy number or gene expression level, leading to false positives or false negatives. Furthermore, the plasmid targeted for mutation must have a very high copy number for the desired mutation rate to be obtained within a practical number of cell generations.</p><p>For gene targeted random mutagenesis, efforts have recently been made to eliminate the ligation step by taking advantage of PCR-based methods for insertion of mutagenic DNA fragments, for example the QuikChange TM kit (Stratagene). Such methods have been widely adopted to insert site-directed mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and more recently to create saturation site-directed random mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> which both target a single codon for mutagenesis. This approach was extended to the targeted random mutagenesis of short regions of DNA (9-15 bp) in which the primers for QuikChange PCR were generated by epPCR with a high mutagenic frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> and also applied to larger epPCR fragments of up to 1000 bp <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. All of these methods permit libraries to be reliably constructed typically within 3 days. However, the true impact of simplifying these methods is still yet to be borne out by their wide acceptance in industry and academia. Furthermore, their application to the recombination of homologous or non-homologous genes is yet to be achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Evolving enzymes for incorporation in chemical synthesis routes</head><p>Biocatalysis is unlikely to replace all chemical syntheses, especially for chemical transformations that have no known enzyme equivalent. Consequently, when biocatalysis can be used, it may be required before or after a series of chemical conversions. A particularly powerful approach in these chemo-enzymatic syntheses is the evolution of an enzymatic step to more efficiently or selectively access a synthon used in subsequent chemical conversions. For example, directed evolution has been used to improve the efficiency, substrate specificity, and selectivity of a toluene dioxygenase for use in a synthesis of the flavour compound 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Chemoenzymatic synthesis of the strawberry furanone 1 was investigated using p-xylene as the starting material. Multigene operons from the toluene dioxygenase plasmid pTrctodNK1 were shuffled, and libraries generated were pre-screened using the indole oxidation assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Active clones were then evaluated for their ability to oxidise pxylene with improved activity. The resulting process uses the biotransformation of p-xylene by whole cells of Escherichia coli JM109 (pTrctodNK1 LS5218) to generate 2, which was purified by extraction. The meso-diol was subsequently ozonolysed in methanol to give a mixture of the diketone and methoxyketal-hemiketal (1:1, 92%) which was heated in butyl acetate and phosphate buffer to generate 1 in 40% yield.</p><p>Combining biocatalytic and chemical steps in a one-pot reaction can facilitate deracemisations and dynamic kinetic resolutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, and directed evolution used to expand the range of substrates accessible for these processes. A general  deracemisation method was previously established, incorporating either a D-or L-amino acid oxidase together with a non-selective reducing agent (e.g. NaCNBH 3 , amineborane), to deracemise a-amino acids with high yields and ees <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. Directed evolution was then applied to the amino acid oxidase to improve its activity towards amines, such as (S)-a-methyl-benzylamine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). Using the new mutant in combination with ammonia-borane to deracemise a-methyl-benzylamine gave the (R)-isomer in 77% yield and 93% ee <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Directed evolution of multi-enzyme biocatalytic processes</head><p>Whole cell biocatalysts occasionally have advantages over isolated enzymes, for example, in the production of large and complex molecules that result from pathways involving multiple enzymic steps, and for oxidation or reduction steps that require cofactor recycling. It is also surprising but true that several small organic compounds, such as 1-glycerol-3-phosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, 1,3-propanediol <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> or shikimic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> can be easier to produce using metabolically engineered whole cells rather than in vitro biocatalysis. Consequently, biocatalytic processes often involve whole cells rather than single enzymes and so directed evolution could also be applied to natural or engineered metabolic pathways, multiple enzyme systems (mini-pathways), and even whole organisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, in a process environment.</p><p>The directed evolution of the three-enzyme pathway encoding arsenate resistance in E. coli, for increased resistance to arsenate, was the first example of the application of DNA shuffling of a metabolic pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Since then, the approach has been combined with that of metabolic engineering to obtain entirely new pathways and products.</p><p>Metabolic engineering is aiming to improve cellular properties by using a combination of mathematical methods for pathway elucidation and modern genetic tools for pathway modification. Through the quantitative analysis of metabolic regulation, bottlenecks in reaction pathways can be identified and this knowledge used to target genetic modifications (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>). Over the last decade, significant progress has been made concerning the application of metabolic engineering to optimise fluxes through natural pathways, modify existing pathways to synthesise novel compounds or for pathway assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Notable examples include the modification of modular enzymes, where entire enzymatic domains of the multifunctional enzymes can be removed, replaced, inactivated or moved to other positions in the enzyme, such as for polyketide synthases (PKS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>, and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Natural hybrid pathways with both PKS and NRPS modules exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> showing that the scope for human manipulation of hybrid pathways is as straightforward as for the individual pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>The combination of rational pathway engineering and directed evolution has been successfully applied to optimise the pathways for the production of isoprenoids, such as carotenoids. Isoprenoids can be synthesised by two different routes, i.e. mevalonate and non-mevalonate pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. Identification of the non-mevalonate pathway in E. coli enabled its use as host organism for carotenoid synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>. Genes for the isoprenoid pathway from Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Agrobacterium aurantiacum were previously coexpressed in E. coli, and directed evolution was subsequently applied to the DNA sequence upstream of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthase gene to optimize its expression level for increased astaxanthin production <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>. In a similar manner, lycopene production has been achieved by co-exression in E. coli of isoprenoid pathway genes from R. sphaeroides, and subsequent directed evolution of the R. sphaeroides phytoene desaturase to alter the product formed <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>. In an independent study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref> E. coli was co-transformed with two plasmids expressing the GGDP synthase (crtBEU) and the phytoene synthase (crtEEU) from E. uredovora, and the phytoene desaturases (crtI) from either E. uredovora and E. herbicola, to produce lycopene (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). DNA shuffling of the phytoene desaturase (crtI) genes from E. herbicola and E. uredovora resulted in both lycopene and 3,4,3 0 ,4 0 -tetradehydrolycopene production. This pathway was extended with the shuffled products of lycopene cyclases (crtY) from E. uredovora and E. herbicola to obtain the new product torulene. More recently, directed evolution has enabled the C-30 carotenoid synthase (crtM) to function as a C-40 synthase, and access to the synthesis of previously unknown C-45 and C-50 carotenoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p><p>Novel isoprenoid compounds have also been obtained using combinatorial cloning approaches that are analogous to modular gene shuffling. For example, combining three different carotenoid desaturases with a carotenoid hydratase, a cyclase, and a hydroxylase in E. coli to generated four novel hydroxycarotenoids with improved antioxidative properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>. More recently, several different carotenoid-modifiying enzymes from different organisms were combined with in vitro evolved biosynthetic precursor pathways to synthesise many new C35 and C40 carotenoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Unnatural D-and L-amino acids can be produced from chemically synthesised racemic hydantoins using a minipathway (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>), consisting of the enzymes hydantoinase and N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid amidohydrolase (N-carbamoylase), either as isolated enzymes or using whole cells expressing them <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Directed evolution of an Ncarbamoylase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens NRLL B11291 improved both the thermostability and the oxidation stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, potentially improving the biocatalytic application of the isolated enzyme mini-pathway.</p><p>While the directed evolution of one or two enzymes within a pathway provides a powerful approach for access to novel compounds, the directed evolution of the genomes of whole organisms provides the potential to evolve whole-cell biocatalysts within a whole process sequence. Whole organism genome shuffling would seem to be a massive task but was shown to be a realistic target when the tylosin pathway of Streptomyces fradiae was manipulated within 1 year, to produce titres of tylosin of 8.1 g L À1 with two rounds of recursive genome shuffling <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. The same titre had been previously achieved, but over the course of 20 years of classical strain improvement. To demonstrate the application of genome shuffling for improved tolerance of whole-cell biocatalysts to process conditions, classical strain-improved variants of Lactobacillus were shuffled to obtain cells that were able to grow at pH 4, and also to produce greater yields of lactic acid than the wild-type <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. Synthesis of torulene using a metabolically engineered E. coli that expresses the GGDP synthase (crtBEU) and the phytoene synthase (crtEEU) from E. uredovora, an evolved phytoene desaturases (crtI), and an evolved lycopene cyclase (crtY). Absence of the evolved lycopene cyclase results in the production of lycopene and 3,4,3 0 ,4 0 -tetradehydrolycopene production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Future applications of directed evolution for biocatalytic processes</head><p>The application of metabolic engineering and wholegenome shuffling to biocatalysis is still in its infancy. Directed evolution will clearly play a role in fine-tuning engineered metabolic pathways, and to adapt whole-cell biocatalysts to the environment that is optimal for the stability and purification of product. The next wave of biocatalysts will most likely be the result of the whole genome shuffling of metabolically engineered cells, for simultaneous improvements in flux, yield, and tolerance to process conditions. To assist in this outcome, convenient methods for genome shuffling of a wider range of organisms, and simplified systems for the mutation of genes in pathways need to be developed. The specific manipulation of coding sequences in whole cells, as opposed to in vitro mutagenesis, has become possible with the use of the lambda-red system from Donald Court's group <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81]</ref>. The techniques, collectively termed 'recombineering' <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>, include the use of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vectors for the propagation of large (&gt;100 kb) fragments in E. coli such that large pathways can be manipulated, altered, and then moved back into the native host. The BAC clones are moved back to the native host by in vivo mating, allowing the altered genes to be recombined into the host genome. As all the steps make use of in vivo techniques, large DNA fragments can be handled with ease and in the Streptomycetes this has been used to identify a protein involved in the recently discovered terpene synthesis pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8.">Conclusions</head><p>Directed evolution is now well established as a means for improving enzyme characteristics. To make full use of this technology for biocatalysis, it is essential that real process conditions were used to define the targets for enzyme improvement by directed evolution. The aim of improving enzymes in these conditions can take advantage of automated microscale processing techniques that facilitate the rapid identification of the optimal biocatalyst-process combination, and by generic high-throughput analytical techniques that are non-invasive. Methods for the generation of recombinant biocatalyst libraries have also continued to develop, providing access to greater and more relevant areas of sequence-space. However, the simplification, automation, and improved robustness of these methods, for example by avoiding ligation steps, may lead to their wider application and also the broader acceptance of biocatalysis as a viable option in pharmaceutical synthesis. The emergence of examples in which evolved enzymes have been used alongside chemical steps, has also demonstrated further useful scenarios for the potential application of biocatalysts. Meanwhile, other powerful techniques, such as metabolic engineering and recombineering are broadening the scope of biocatalysis, and directed evolution can play a central role in tailoring this new generation of enhanced multi-enzyme and whole cell biocatalysts, for use in industrial processes. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 .Fig. 1 .</head><label>21</label><figDesc>Fig. 2.
