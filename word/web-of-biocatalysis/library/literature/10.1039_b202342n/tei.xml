<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Directed evolution of proteins and enzymes provides a large number of new biomolecules with high relevance to chemical processes. The use of this biological tool and the evolved enzymes that derive from it is still relatively limited to the area of biocatalysis. 1,2,3 Fields of applications of the evolved proteins or enzymes span from the pharmaceutical industry to the development of catalysts in diagnostic kits, improved tools for research comprising restriction enzymes, polymerases, sensors, use of engineered lipases and proteases as components and additives in detergents.</p><p>The enzymes obtained from directed evolution may also be used as new tools to carry out the synthesis of fine chemicals, making use of key properties such as regio-and stereospecificity of the reactions. They can also be used to degrade unnatural compounds of environmental relevance. This review will cover some of the most recent methods used to engineer evolved enzymes; it will also report on the progress made both in the theoretical knowledge and practical application of evolved proteins and enzymes relevant to natural and unnatural product chemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Achieving enzymatic molecular diversity</head><p>Directed evolution is achieved by iterative cycles of random mutagenesis, recombination and functional screening of a library of variants from which mutants with improved or new properties can be identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p><p>Essentially this approach mimics in vitro the natural process of molecular evolution that is able to generate a potentially infinite plethora of proteins with new functions and properties, such as stability to temperature and solvents, improved catalytic performance and substrate specificity. These properties can be pushed beyond those already present in natural enzymes. Evolution and selection of properties such as high stability to temperature, pH, time, harsh environmental conditions in the presence of organic solvents, enantioselectivity, novel substrate recognition and high catalytic efficiency, are better achieved in parallel by this approach rather than by rational design, given the multifactorial and synergistic effects required in the mutation and sequence shuffling on the newly developed catalyst. Directed evolution is also the elected method for evolving enzymes with new functional properties without knowledge of the structural details of the target protein: 4,5 the results deriving from this approach are often rationalised a posteriori by molecular modelling when the sequence of the mutants has been determined. The two approaches of directed evolution and rational design can be successfully combined to further explore the possible new function landscape, related to a fine tuned manipulation not only of the protein primary structure, but also of the encoding sequence for improved expression levels and codon usage. The achievements in this field have Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> General scheme of directed evolution approach: a first cycle of mutagenesis and/or shuffling on target genes is followed by screening/ selection of desired protein properties. The first generation modified genes are then subjected to refinement cycles on the same scheme to generate second and third generation variants.</p><p>contributed to the elucidation of the interdependence of structural-functional properties and offered new strategies to produce de novo engineered catalysts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">6</ref> Directed evolution is based on the generation of genetic diversity by random mutagenesis, DNA recombination and DNA shuffling. These methods mimic the natural processes occurring during the asexual or sexual evolutionary process. As for Darwinian evolution a key step in this approach is represented by a selective pressure imposed by the experimentalist allowing the addition of beneficial mutations and the removal of deleterious ones. The selective pressure is designed by the researcher in the laboratory by the application of an appropriate selection or screening method. The general rule that "you get what you screen for" indicates that this step is a particularly delicate one and often represents the bottleneck to the success of directed evolution in developing improved or new biocatalysts. The selection or method must be rapid, sensitive and allow the clear identification of the desired properties, implying that the screening must not be marred by undesired selection criteria.</p><p>Molecular diversity can be created in a number of ways, for example by combinatorial cassette mutagenesis or error prone PCR. In combinatorial cassette mutagenesis, a relatively short DNA sequence is mutagenised by synthetic oligonucleotide primers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">7</ref> This method has the advantage that it is relatively straightforward, but it is useful only when the targeted amino acids are in the same stretch of primary sequence. It relies on the synthesis of a large number of oligonucleotide primers, and therefore it is combinatorial only within the limits of the synthetic oligonucleotides, with the disadvantage that it may be labour intensive and expensive. Error prone PCR (epPCR) is by far the most used approach to produce random mutants. It was developed by Leung in 1989 8, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">9</ref> who exploited the ability of thermostable DNA polymerases lacking proof-reading activity, for example Taq polymerase, to introduce random mistakes during the extension of the new DNA strand. Taq has the highest known rate of error, in the range of 0.1 × 10 Ϫ4 to 2 × 10 Ϫ4 per nucleotide per pass of the polymerase. Error prone PCR is able to produce large libraries of random mutants in a sequential fashion where deleterious mutations are accumulated in conjunction with beneficial ones. This can seriously limit the evolutionary process because of the high probability that the effects of the few beneficial mutations are lost due to the many deleterious ones. From a biological point of view, sequential random mutagenesis is equivalent to an asexual evolutionary process.</p><p>A breakthrough in directed evolution was made by Stemmer in 1994 with the introduction of DNA shuffling. This allows the in vitro formation of recombinant genes from a set of parental ones. 10, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11</ref> DNA shuffling requires the availability of a pool of homologous genes that can be derived from a naturally occurring protein family or from a library of mutants produced by error prone PCR. Error prone PCR can introduce a number of point mutations in a gradual fashion but it lacks the essential features of block changes typical of DNA shuffling that also enables the removal of deleterious mutations by back-crossing with parental or wild type DNA. Block changes are introduced with the fragmentation of the pool of genes using DNase I. The fragments are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and reassembled into a full-length gene by repeated cycles of PCR without added primers. During this step the fragments prime each other on the homologous regions, resulting in recombination when fragments derived from one parental gene prime on another one, causing a template switch (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</p><p>The recombinant genes obtained with this procedure can then be used for other rounds of mutation and recombination. Key features of DNA shuffling are:</p><p>1) the requirement of considerable quantities of DNA templates with homologous regions able to prime each other;</p><p>2) the presence of sequences of homology separated by regions of diversity;</p><p>3) the block changes typical of sexual recombination brought about by template-switch or cross-over.</p><p>The features of the method have been subject of studies, 12 highlighting that the process is strongly affected by biases, resulting in limited possibilities for recombining point mutations in close regions, and generating libraries with an overrepresentation of parental sequences, especially when sequence identity is around the lower limit of 70%. This means that including a relatively diverse parent, potentially allowing the exploration of more vast sequence-space, is often detrimental rather than beneficial to library quality and diversity. Also the 70% DNA sequence identity threshold is a limit to the creation of improved enzymes and catalysts, since although many interesting target proteins show very similar functions and high 3D structural homology, they often share only a very low sequence identity. These observations led to modifications and improvements of the original basic protocols, in order to further explore the sequence mutation space and to limit the required number of screening tests to be performed to isolate the desired variants. The Staggered Extension Protocol (StEP) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) has dramatically decreased the amount of the DNA template required by DNA shuffling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> This method allows template switching during the synthesis, thus yielding chimeric genes without the requirement of the DNase I fragmentation step. The DNA templates are mixed with one or more primers and subjected to cycles of denaturation and short annealing/extension steps. The growing PCR products, or fragments, randomly prime to different templates and further extensions will contain template switching. The process is repeated until full-length genes are obtained and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p><p>As an answer to overcome the limitations of classical shuffling that recombines only at highly homologous regions, a convenient method is Iterative Truncation for the Creation of HYbrid enzymes (ITCHY) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). This method allows the generation of N-and C-terminal fragment libraries of two genes by progressive truncation of the coding sequences with exonuclease III, followed by ligation of the products to make a single cross-over hybrid library. This strategy yields cross-overs throughout the entire coding region, irrespective of sequence identity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> ITCHY was also combined with the classical shuffling protocol in a methodology called SCRATCHY, linked to a modelling framework (eSCRATCHY) that gives predictions on the expected results and biases for any given sequence (fragment length, sequence identity, influence of cross-overs). A library containing up to three cross-overs per sequence was generated by using ITCHY, doubling the performance of DNA shuffling even at a high level of sequence identity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">15</ref> Another method able to generate libraries of hybrid genes from distantly related sequences is Sequence Homology Independent Protein Recombination (SHIPREC) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>A key feature of SHIPREC is that it ensures cross-overs at positions sharing a similar structural environment, maximising the probability of obtaining functional proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> The SHIPREC procedure starts with the fusion of two genes to give a heterodimer. This is then digested by DNase I in the presence of Mn 2ϩ that favours double-strand breaks over nicks, producing an ensemble of fragments of random lengths. Fragments of length corresponding to that of either gene parent are isolated and treated with S1 nuclease or T4 polymerase to produce blunt ends. The chimeric genes are first circularised by intra-molecular blunt end ligation, followed by linearisation by restriction digestion. This creates a library of chimeric DNA sequences where the gene that was at the 5Ј position in the dimer will now be at the 3Ј position and will donate the C-terminus of the hybrid protein. The cross-over will therefore be distributed over the entire length of the gene. This approach has been applied to produce soluble hybrids of the membrane associated human cytochrome P450 1A2 and the soluble haem domain of the bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3, that share only 16% sequence identity. The SHIPREC method successfully produced cross-overs mainly at structurally related sites along the sequences. The resulting folded and partially soluble hybrid P450s had cross-overs close to one of the termini, where there is no structural similarity. Simple cross-overs in the interior of the proteins were too disruptive to produce a folded and active protein. In a recent review <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> an analysis is presented of theoretical characteristics (length, biases for recombination position and truncation length) for libraries produced by incremental truncation-like methods: SHIPREC, 16 ITCHY 14, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> and its modification Thio-ITCHY. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">19</ref> The method that improves recombination the most at allowed and well-defined structural boundaries is the more recently developed SCOPE (structurebased combinatorial protein engineering). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">20</ref> This requires a deeper analysis of the parent protein sequences and the knowledge of the structures in order to direct recombination by PCR as for natural exon shuffling.</p><p>A few more recent methods (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) share a basic concept of driving the recombination to the desired degree of variability by means of designed oligonucleotides of various lengths or single strand DNA (ssDNA) as scaffolds or templates. The first of such approaches, RACHITT (Random CHImeragenesis on Transient Templates) was developed by the group of Monticello <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">21</ref> and it is based on reassembly of trimmed parental genes on a transient ssDNA template, followed by gap-filling, flaps digestion, ligation and destruction of the scaffold. This approach was demonstrated to brilliantly solve the limitation to library diversity due to the presence of parental sequences or "sibling" chimeras. An average of 14.0 cross-overs per chimeric gene, as obtained by applying the method to evolution of dibenzothiophene monooxygenases, makes this method a top choice for highly recombinant gene libraries, with a relatively small percentage of inactive clones. The limitation is rather technical, since a good quality ssDNA template is crucial and might be difficult to synthesise. A simplified method was developed by the same authors and called Degenerate Homo-Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Methods used for enhancing recombination to obtain more diverse libraries for directed evolution (Staggered Extension Protocol, StEP; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">13</ref> Iterative Truncation for the Creation of HYbrid enzymes, ITCHY; 14 Sequence Homology Independent Protein RECombination, SHIPREC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">16</ref> RAndom CHImeragenesis on Transient Template, RACHITT; 21 Synthetic Shuffling; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> Sequence-Independent Site-Directed Chimeragenesis, SISDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28</ref> ).</p><p>duplex Recombination (DHR). The long ssDNA scaffold is replaced by degenerate bridging oligos as "partial scaffold" only, since they are modified so that they do not take part in the ligation or extension process, therefore avoiding biases.</p><p>Another approach to maximise the recombination frequency while allowing each amino acid to be varied independently was developed by Ness and coworkers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> The method, called SYN-THETIC SHUFFLING, is based on the use of synthetic oligonucleotides designed from database sequences (both overlapping and partially degenerated oligos of around 60 bp in length and spiking oligos) to build a "backbone" encompassing the overall variability of chosen proteins, in this case subtilisin. Optimal codon usage for expression in Bacillus subtilis and sequence adjustment to maximise DNA sequence identity can be designed while choosing the appropriate oligonucleotides. The generated library from 15 genes of the subtilisin family was analysed before selection by sequencing 89 randomly picked clones: the evolutionary tree connecting variants was more deeply branched, demonstrating a better degree of variance from parental genes and among the library, than that resulting from the fragmentation-shuffled library. Before selection 20% of clones were found to be active, thus allowing a relatively low throughput screen, more relevant to precisely isolate the desired properties. Four variants with improved activity compared to the commercially used Savinase ® were isolated, two of them with a double to four-fold higher activity after heat treatment and more thermostable than any of the parents. The selected clones also displayed a higher ratio of activity at pH 10 over pH 7, meaning that a desirable higher stability to autolysis was achieved during enzyme production. No addition to the diversity represented by the chosen parental sequence was introduced but the system allows free recombination so that the aminoacid changes from Savinase ® in the selected clones ranges from 18 to 28. Without the need for physical starting genes this approach granted access to a further sequence-space linked to improvement in the properties of a commercially relevant biocatalyst. A conceptually similar approach (although operatively different) was applied by the group of Manfred Reetz <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> to generate a library of variants of lipases with desired enantioselectivity. The method, called ADO (for Assembly of Designed Oligos) relies on sequence information to design oligos encoding for the sequences of two or more parental genes with appropriate degeneracy at given positions; controlled overlaps can be introduced in conserved regions and a desired degree of random codon mutations, insertion or deletion further ensures the exploration of sequence space while retaining a high percentage of active variants. If the homology level is too low to allow such overlap, a ligation method previously used on ssDNA with unknown terminal sequence for "Random Insertion and Deletion" (RID) mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref> was adapted to extend the oligos. As a test the authors combined five oligos (138 to 81 bp in length) that were designed on sequences of genes LipA and LipB, encoding lipases of two different families from B. subtilis. The oligos were alternatively directed along the sequence and overlapped by 15 to 33 bp. A primer-less PCR followed by reassembly of the whole gene yielded 3000 clones, of which 25 were found active as catalysts. Two improved clones in terms of percentage of conversion and enantiomeric excess (ee) were isolated by screening with a model reaction involving the hydrolysis of a meso-diacetate. One variant is a very good example of hybrid of LipA and LipB, bearing 20 mutations arising from LipA and 20 from LipB, plus eight point mutations by degeneracy of the code and introduced by PCR.</p><p>Other recent methods to create directed evolution libraries include CLERY (Combinatorial Libraries Enhanced by Recombination in Yeast), a combination of PCR reassembly and in vivo recombination in yeast to avoid biases from E. coli employment in expression, that was applied to generate a combinatorial library of 74% identical cytochrome P450s CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 from human, 25, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">26</ref> and MURA (Mutagenic and Unidirectional ReAssembly), <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref> that can generate incrementally truncated and shuffled variants by a combination of Dnase I fragmentation and unidirectional reassembly via a chosen primer, applied to the change of substrate specificity from a phospholipase to a lipase.</p><p>Very recently the group of Arnold presented the sequenceindependent site-directed chimeragenesis (SISDC) method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28</ref> A general method for sequence-independent site-directed chimeragenesis that allows for recombination of distantly related (or unrelated) proteins at multiple discrete sites with little sequence bias and in which all targeted fragments were recombined in the desired order. The computational algorithm called SCHEMA was also developed to estimate the disruption caused in the three-dimensional structure of a protein by the inheritance of aminoacid from different parents upon recombination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Functional screening of the library</head><p>A key requirement to proceed in the iterative cycles leading to the best recombinant protein is the availability of a screening or selection procedure that is sensitive to the properties targeted in the in vitro evolution process. This step is not trivial, as the vast majority of the mutations are deleterious and only very few will lead to the improved target property. The number of possible variants (V) of a protein that can be created by introducing M substitutions simultaneously over N amino acids is given by the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V = 19 M [N!/(N Ϫ M )! M!]</formula><p>This means that even for a small protein, when only 10 positions are targeted for three simultaneous changes of amino acids, there are 823,080 possible variants. The ability to identify one possible active variant among this large library is close to the limit of most screening or selection methods.</p><p>Traditionally the term selection is reserved for the methods of searching a library based on an enzymatic function that confers a growth or survival advantage to the host organism. An example of selection is given by Stemmer in the first application of DNA shuffling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">11</ref> In this work Stemmer used a mixture of ß-lactamase genes to carry out three cycles of DNA shuffling and two cycles of back-crossing with wild type DNA. E. coli XL1-blue containing the plasmid expressing the mutagenised ß-lactamases was grown on agar plates containing increasing amount of the antibiotic cefotaxime. Only the E. coli expressing the ß-lactamase with improved activity towards cefotaxime could grow on plates containing increasing amounts of the antibiotic. This allowed a 32,000-fold increase of the minimum inhibitory concentration from 0.02 µg ml Ϫ1 typical of the wild type to 640 µg ml Ϫ1 typical of the evolved enzyme. Generally the use of a host organism as a means for biological selection is very efficient and it allows searches of libraries containing more than 10 6 variants. There is however a high risk that, under the selective pressure, the host organism itself develops alternative metabolic mechanisms unrelated to the target activity.</p><p>On the other hand, a screening procedure involves the construction of an arrayed protein library and the application of a rapid and high throughput assay sufficiently sensitive and specific to enable the identification of positive variants. The development of the screening assay is usually the critical step in the directed evolution of a particular enzyme. Although in some cases visual screens based on colour or halo-formation are rapid and straightforward, they are non-quantitative and often insensitive to small changes in the enzymatic properties. Preference is given to quantitative assays based on 96 (or more) well plates. This format is not only quantitative, but it is also amenable to automation using robotic arms, liquid handling systems and plate readers with automated data acquisition. There are a number of examples of screening procedures described in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31</ref> In keeping with the theme of cytochrome P450, this paragraph will give three examples of screening procedures developed for two members of this class of enzymes.</p><p>Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate monooxygenases able to catalyse the insertion of one atom of oxygen from O 2 into a wide variety of substrates with concomitant production of water, using the reducing equivalents of NAD(P)H normally provided through a redox chain involving one or two electron transfer proteins. They are involved in key reactions of detoxification of xenobiotics and biosynthesis of steroids, generating much interest in the bioanalytical area. Arnold and coworkers 32 developed mutants of P450cam from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that are able to utilise the electrons and oxygen provided by hydrogen peroxide, eliminating the need for expensive cofactors and complex redox chains. P450cam was evolved to acquire hydroxylating activity towards the unnatural substrate naphthalene. The screening procedure relied on the co-expression of the horseradish peroxidase mutant Asn255Asp (HRP1A6). This mutant was previously obtained by directed evolution to allow expression of HRP in an active form in E. coli. After 16 h growth on agar/Terrific Broth plates, the P450cam variants and HRP1A6 were replicated using a nitrocellulose membrane and transferred onto fresh agar plates containing 6 mM naphthalene and 10-30 mM hydrogen peroxide. The naphthols generated by the P450cam variants were converted by HRP1A6 into fluorescent dimers and polymers that were detected by fluorescence digital imaging. Different naphthols obtained by diverse P450cam variants of altered regio-specificity of hydroxylation are polymerised by HRP1A6 in products with different fluorescence spectra. These characteristics were used to select P450cam variants tuned to various regio-specificities of catalysis. Variants with improved properties were subjected to in vitro recombination by StEP, yielding several mutants with ∼20-fold improvement in naphthalene hydroxylation activity over the wild type.</p><p>Another interesting monooxygenase is P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium. This enzyme contains the haem catalytic domain fused with the FMN/FAD reductase on the same polypeptidic chain. Wild type P450 BM3 hydroxylates fatty acids of chain length between C12 and C18. Arnold and co-workers engineered this enzyme to hydroxylate short chain alkanes such as octane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">33</ref> The screening procedure used an octane analogue, 8-pnpane, that upon terminal hydroxylation produces an unstable hemiacetal. This decomposes into the aldehyde and p-nitrophenolate that is detected by its yellow colour at 410 nm. Two rounds of error prone PCR and the screening of 2,000-3,000 colonies produced a variant with activity 2-3 fold higher than the wild type. Both the screening procedures described so far are specific to the substrate under investigation, and in the case of the octane is also dependent on the position of the hydroxylation. A general screening procedure developed using P450 BM3, but applicable to all NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes has been developed in our laboratory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34</ref> The screening procedure relies on the conversion of the NADP ϩ resulting from enzymatic activity into a fluorescent product upon treatment with alkali (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>): for this reason it has been named "alkali assay". The procedure can be applied to purified enzymes as well as to whole E. coli cells expressing the target NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme. The wide applicability, the use of whole cells, the simplicity of procedure and the suitability for a microtiter plate format are very important properties for high throughput screening purposes. The alkali assay offers a powerful tool for important areas of application such as screening for NAD(P)H-linked enzymatic activity of molecules of pharmacological and biotechnological interest and screening libraries of random mutants of NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes to allow the design of new biocatalysts.</p><p>Recent high-throughput screenings were also designed for selection and evolution of enzymes with desired enantioselectivity. These methods are equally well applied to the characterisation of products of asymmetric combinatorial chemistry. Mostly they rely on the isotope labelling of chiral or prochiral substrate in order to obtain products that are differentiated in molecular weight (detectable by mass spectrometry) or in the group signal (NMR) due to the stereospecific reaction catalysed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">35</ref> The most recent method is based on FT-IR spectroscopy and allows precise quantisation of the products by applying the Lambert-Beer Law to the obtained spectra after appropriate calibration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">36</ref> The 13 C labelling of carbonyl groups, that provides clean and intense IR spectral bands, resulted in an accuracy of ±5% for enantiomeric excess (ee) values; the method was tested on the enantiomeric determination of chiral esters (acetates and acetamides) that are possible substrates to hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases. The automated protocol allowed a high-throughput of 10000 samples per day and the possibility to determine the ee directly in culture supernatant, still maintaining an accuracy of ±7%, well below the limit of ±10% found in most of the other available methods.</p><p>Specifically designed screening procedures were also applied to specific classes of enzymes with excellent improvements in performance: for example, a screening strategy was developed to evolve DNA polymerases as well as accessory enzymes related to the replication process. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37</ref> The method is based on the principle of linking genotype and phenotype by segregation of self-replicating systems into heat-stable individual aqueous compartments of water-in-oil emulsion, with adjustment of the emulsification conditions so that each compartment contains a single clone. The enhanced efficiency of selected polymerases ensures proportionally increased representation and therefore selection of related encoding genes. Other applications were suggested by authors for screening of increased efficiency of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), converting dNDPs to dNTPs for supplying the polymerase reaction. The method can also be extended to screening and selection of other enzymes by designing an appropriate coupling of the polymerase reaction to the production of substrate (i.e. for replicase) and the consumption of inhibitors.</p><p>Another method, called PROfusion, based on the linking of mRNA to its corresponding polypeptide, was recently proposed as a powerful screening approach, amenable for array format. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">38</ref> In vitro compartmentalisation and sorting by FACS (Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">39</ref> was recently applied to the selection of a very fast phosphotriesterase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">40</ref> Arrays of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates have also been recently reviewed as instruments for high-throughput screening of evolved enzymes. 41</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Target proteins</head><p>This section will provide examples of key enzymes "evolved-inthe-lab", following the conventional nomenclature and focusing on those that represent key achievements of directed evolution in protein engineering and that are more relevant for biocatalysis and industrial application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Oxygen dependent catalysis and oxidoreductases</head><p>Oxygenases are key enzymes for the degradation of toxic compounds such as pollutants, drugs and other xenobiotics, allowing the C-H bond to be attacked by molecular oxygen in highly selective and stereospecific reactions. Therefore their application as biocatalysts is of great theoretical and practical interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">42</ref> Protein engineering can be successfully applied to achieve activity, protein stability and a range of recognised substrates beyond those of the naturally occurring oxygenases. Often these enzymes are organised in multiple domains or components with finely tuned and interdependent properties. This, combined with a low stability and complexity of catalysis, makes them a paradigm and a challenging target of directed evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">44</ref> As a result the progress on the production and industrial biocatalysis of these enzymes is relatively more recent than for other classes of enzymes. Examples of success of directed evolution on these enzymes are related to the gain of new functions, stabilisation and activity improvement of enzymes relevant to industrial biocatalysis and detoxification. A considerable number of studies targeted the directed evolution of cytochrome P450s, given their relevance to detoxification and fine synthesis in fields spanning from bioremediation to drug design and metabolism. A few examples have already been discussed in the previous sections. A further application of the described 8-pnpane screening strategy 32 was applied to the evolution of P450 BM3 with correction for "addiction" of the selected enzyme to the screening substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">45</ref> The most active third generation mutants selected on 8-pnpane allowed a direct screening on octane with a high-throughput NADH-consumption assay. Five generations of mutagenesis (by epPCR and StEP) and screening yielded P450 BM3 clone 139-3, a better catalyst than the naturally occurring enzyme with higher activity on octane as the most preferred substrate, i.e. the membrane-bound, multicomponent AlkB from Pseudomonas oleovorans that reaches a maximum turnover rate of 210 min Ϫ1 . The 139-3 variant of P450 BM3 displays a turnover rate of 3020 min Ϫ1 towards octane and an even higher activity on pentane (3250 min Ϫ1 ), cyclohexane (3910 min Ϫ1 ) and hexane (3840 min Ϫ1 ). The same variant also accepted small gaseous hydrocarbons (propane and butane with turnover rates of 860 and 1830 min Ϫ1 respectively) with 100% 2-propanol and 2-butanol production, thus maintaining the specificity of hydroxylation position of the wild type enzyme. The 139-3 variant also displays an improved specificity for octane conversion to 2-octanol (66% vs. a 17% of wild type) and retains the percentage of hexane to 3-hexanol conversion (80%) found in the wild type (Scheme 1).</p><p>This newly developed alkane hydroxylase also maintained a tight coupling of oxygen consumption to substrate hydroxylation, with very slight uncoupling and water production on cyclohexane. Interestingly 139-3 also evolved as a better catalyst on the wild type's most favourite substrates, palmitic acid and lauric acid (Scheme 1) with approximately two-fold increased turnover rates and an improved K d to laurate from 260 to 19 µM. Five of the 11 aminoacid substitutions in variant 139-3 were found to occur in helices F-G, their connecting loop and in helix I, regions that are known to undergo large conformational changes during substrate binding and release. Only one (V78A) was found to be in direct contact with the substrate. Another mutation (R255S) causes a salt bridge disruption that might favour flexibility and alkane binding. Compared to a previous approach of rational engineering that improved activity of P450 BM3 on octane and aromatic substrates, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46</ref> the directed evolution approach led to an entirely different solution and went beyond the limits of natural evolution, since variant 139-3 is the fastest alkane hydroxylase known to date. The potential of directed evolution on P450 BM3 does not appear to be limited to the above mentioned achievement: parallel efforts by directed evolution and reaction engineering were put into enhancing stability also in organic solvent <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47</ref> and in substituting the expensive cofactor with a cheaper electron supplier. 32,48,49,50 Previous evidence 51 supported the possibility of evolving this cytochrome to hydroxylate substrates with no structural homology to the fatty acid natural substrates: a triple mutant (F87V, L188Q, A74G) of P450 BM3 was obtained by a combination of rational design and saturation PCR (defined by authors as rational evolution) and was demonstrated to be an indole hydroxylation catalyst with a catalytic efficiency of 1365 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 . While other P450s with wide substrate specificities were reported to hydroxylate indole, the P450 BM3 wt has no detectable activity on this substrate. Interestingly, the P450 BM3 triple mutant displays more than 10 times higher turnover rates than that of many of the above-mentioned indole hydroxylating P450s. The group of Arnold and co-workers recently described another interesting variant of bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3, named 21B3, 50 that catalyses the selective oxidation of the C-H bond in simplified reaction conditions. The haem domain of wild type P450 BM3 (BMP) is able to catalyse with very low efficiency (&lt;5 min Ϫ1 ) a hydroxylation reaction driven by hydrogen peroxide as source of oxygen and bypassing the requirement for expensive electron donors (NADPH), cofactor regeneration and rate-limiting electron-transfer steps. A peroxide-driven P450cam had previously been evolved for naphthalene hydroxylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">32</ref> A mutant of BMP, HF87A, with higher efficiency (23 min Ϫ1 ) was used as a starting point for evolving variants with improved peroxygenase activity. The selected 21B3 variant displayed a K M app. for hydrogen peroxide lowered to 8 mM compared to the 30 mM of mutant HF87A and a v max of 800 min Ϫ1 versus 150 min Ϫ1 of HF87A on the screening substrate 12-p-nitrophenoxycarboxylic acid (12pNCA). A five-fold increase was also obtained on initial rate and total turnover numbers (TON) on lauric acid, one of the wild type's most preferred substrates. A relaxed substrate specificity also allowed hydroxylation of styrene with TON up to 240 min Ϫ1 (for wild type P450 BM-3 in the NADPH driven reaction the value is 30 min Ϫ1 ). Variant 21B3 arose from 13 nucleotide substitutions with nine aminoacid variations compared to HF87A. Four mutations were localised at the protein surface. No mutations were found in the active site, in the substrate binding channel, on F/G helices or any β-sheets. The work is now completed in a recent paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">52</ref> reporting a further evolution of the peroxide-driven biocatalyst previously engineered to have an improved thermal stability. The 21B3 variant is less thermostable than HF87A or even than the wild type haem domain. Retention of peroxygenase activity after heat treatment was obtained by screening after six cycles of random mutagenesis and shuffling, resulting in variant 5H6. This has eight aminoacid substitutions from 21B3 and 15 from HF87A, plus the deletion of one histidine from the C-terminal inserted tag. Five substitutions are located on the protein surface and among these two involve charge insertion (S106R) or inversion (E442K), three are conservative in size and hydrophobicity (L324I, V340M, I366V) and another two (L52I, A184V) are located in buried regions. Four stabilising mutations are adjacent to hot spots where mutations accumulated improving the peroxygenase activity, suggesting that they may counter balance perturbations introduced by pushing the protein evolution to the non-natural peroxygenase activity. The paper demonstrated that a successive adjustment of evolution conditions can achieve a good compromise of function and stability to generate powerful biocatalysts that can have a real impact for biotechnological exploitation. The 5H6 variant is actually significantly more thermostable (T 50 = 61 ЊC and t 1/2 at 57.5 ЊC = 115 min) than other variants (HF87A t 1/2 at 57.5 ЊC = 2.3 min) and the wild type (BMP T 50 = 57 ЊC) while retaining high peroxygenase activity (220 min Ϫ1 on 12-pNCA versus 430 min Ϫ1 of variant 21B3 in the same conditions). The results also stressed the versatility and potentiality of cytochrome P450 BM-3 as a target for the development of efficient and cheap biocatalyst-based industrial processes. An even more recent paper <ref type="bibr">53</ref> from the same group illustrated the achievement of further evolution of variant 139-3 to obtain a unique system for regio-and enantioselective hydroxylation of linear alkanes. Variants 9-10A-A328V and 1-12G can produce S-2-and R-2octanol respectively, displaying a very good regio-selectivity for the position 2 (80%) and enantiomeric excess (ee) around 40% (Scheme 2). Also, a 12-fold improvement was achieved for 1-12G versus 139-3 in terms of total turnover of hydroxylated propane, and a 7.5-fold improvement for total turnover on octane.</p><p>Another target of laboratory evolution among oxygenases is represented by biphenyl dioxygenases. 54,55, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> These enzymes catalyse the insertion of two hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring of biphenyls and their polychlorinated derivatives, increasing their reactivity and thus the following enzymatic fission of the aromatic ring. This represents a key step in the biodegradation of highly recalcitrant pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">57</ref> Of the multicomponent enzyme only the large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase (encoded by bphA genes of the bph operon) was reported to be involved in substrate recognition. 58,59, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">60</ref> The evolved variants combined two bphA genes with high similarity (only 20 encoded aminoacids differ), but whose protein products display a large difference in substrate specificity. BphA from Burkholderia cepacia LB400 acts on a wide range of PCBs but preferentially dioxygenates the ortho-derivatives of biphenyl; the homologous enzyme from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 attacks with relatively high activity di-para-substituted PCBs that are poor substrates for the Burkholderia cepacia LB400 BphA. By DNA shuffling Furukawa and co-workers 54 generated variants of BphA with extended substrate specificity, namely clones pSHF2007 and pSHF2008 which can dioxygenate 4,4Ј-and 2,5,2Ј,5Ј-chlorobiphenyl to their 2,3-and 3,4dioxygenated derivatives. Some evolved variants gained enhanced degrading activity not only towards PCBs but also for benzene and toluene, substrates poorly recognised by the native KF707 and LB400 enzymes. In principle, by shuffling these two genes one could obtain variants that additively combine the catalytic activity of parental clones to double ortho-and parasubstituted PCBs. This combined activity was not detected in this study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">54</ref> probably due to the selective screening employed. On the same couple of proteins a different screening approach was applied to a library obtained by DNA shuffling and StEP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> The meta-cleavage products of both ortho-and para-substituted congeners are easily detected because of their yellow colour and this was used to select variants with enhanced degradation capabilities to degrade polychlorinated PCBs (Scheme 3) and their commercial mixtures (Arochlor 1242 and Arochlor 1254). The variants displaying the additive properties of both parental enzymes raised from template switching/crossovers in critical region III and IV, were suggested to be involved in substrate specificity.</p><p>Another enzyme acting on similar substrates was evolved for substrate specificity to obtain "gain-of-function" variants. 61 Scheme 2 Regio-and stereo-specificity of two P450 BM3 variants obtained by directed evolution. <ref type="bibr">53</ref> 2-Hydroxybiphenyl-3-monooxygenase, the product of the Pseudomonas azelaica gene HbpA, is a flavoenzyme that catalyses the ortho hydroxylation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl, used as a fungicide, to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. HbpA expressed in E. coli was applied as biocatalyst for production of various 3-substituted catechols. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">62</ref> Directed evolution was applied on Hbp A gene to generate variants by epPCR and plate-screening for the brownish-reddish product (i.e. 2-tert-butylcatechol) of guaiacol and 2-tert-butylphenol hydroxylation. Selected variants displayed enhanced activity to 2-hydroxybiphenyl, 2-sec-butylphenol, guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol) and 2-tert-butylphenol. This was accompanied by a favourable increase of NADH coupling. The substrate reactivity of Hbp variant with mutation V368A/L417F was changed, enhancing by 8.2 times the k cat /K M ratio of guaiacol and improving by five times the k cat of 2-tert-butylphenol. The improvement was mostly connected to a decrease of K M values of obtained variants. This is relevant in view of the biotechnological production of 3-substituted catechols by in situ product recovery, based on the principle of low substrate and product concentration thus limiting the toxic effect of the substrates on the bacterial cells. Moreover, no activity has been reported for the ortho-hydroxylation of guaiacol and 2-tert-butylphenol by any natural enzyme. Another selected variant with mutation I244V displayed higher turnover rates on the natural substrate, on guaiacol and 2-sec-butylphenol. The structure-function relationship of the variants was rationalised by homology modelling on Scheme 3 Scheme of general reaction catalysed by biphenyl dioxygenase. Both 2,3-(as reported in the scheme) and 3,4-dioxygenated derivatives can be obtained. Directed evolution (DE) was applied to the subunit encoded by gene BphA 54, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> and responsible for PCB substrate recognition and catalysis. The involvement of related gene products of the bph operon to generate the yellow meta-cleavage products (i.e. PCB detoxification catalysis) is indicated. The panel lists the PCB congeners recognised by the shuffled wild type genes (wt 707 and wt 400) and by variant S4.43 that shows dramatically improved degradation of highly chlorinated PCBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">55</ref> the Trichosporon cutaneum phenol hydroxylase crystal structure. While I244 is in the substrate-binding pocket, the other two positions were found to be less obvious candidates for being involved in substrate specificity. V368 belongs to the FAD binding domain, possibly with effects on flavin ring mobility; L417 is located in the domain involved in subunit interaction. A screening procedure for the indigo and indirubine producing colonies was carried out on the same library, leading to the selection the of the HpbAind variant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">63</ref> HpbAind can hydroxylate indole, hydroxyindole and 5-bromoindole and it is the first flavoprotein with indigo productivity (5 mg L Ϫ1 h Ϫ1 ) comparable to that of well established biocatalysts for production of this dye (engineered P450 BM3 for indigo production), usually based on multidomain oxygenase with haem or non-haem iron catalytic centres (as an example naphthalene dioxygenase has a productivity of 1 mg L Ϫ1 h Ϫ1 ). The authors stressed the relevance of this novel indole hydroxylating catalyst for production of indirubin and their more soluble analogues, which are promising compounds for anticancer drugs. This paper also gave insight in the relevance of D222 in the enzyme catalytic cycle. The molecular model suggested that the HpbAind mutation D222V, located close to bound substrate in substrate-binding domain, causes a 330-fold increase in k cat /K M compared to wt, but it also affects NADH uncoupling that increases from 20% to 66%, with a slight improvement (56%) in the double mutant D222V-V368A. This is in keeping with observations on the critical role of NADH coupling of residues that in the alignment of homologous flavin dependent oxygenases were found to correspond to D222. Directed evolution was also applied to a multicomponent diiron monooxygenase, toluene monooxygenase (TOM), from Burkholderia cepacia, to enhance conversion of naphthalene to naphthol, and to promote the degradation of chlorinated pollutants like trichloroethylene (TCE). <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">64</ref> The natural enzyme has evolved to convert toluene to methylcatechol by two monooxygenating steps. The enzyme is multicomponent and requires the expression of an entire tomA012345 operon encoding six open reading frames (ORF). The tomA012345 genes, inserted in a suitable expression vector (pBS(kan)tom) were subjected to modified DNA shuffling on a region encompassing all tomA2 A3 A4 and including 57% of tom A1 and 56% of tom A5. Expression of the functional wild type genes in E. coli spontaneously generated coloured colonies thus helping a first screening. The coloured colonies obtained by transformation with the constructed library were screened for naphthol formation by detection of purple diazo dye from tetraazotised o-dianisine and for TCE mineralization by Cl Ϫ reaction with Fe(NH 4 )SO 4 in HNO 3 and Hg(SCN) 2 to produce the 450 nm absorbing Fe(SCN) 2ϩ . The variant TOM-Green (from colony colour, possibly occurring by accumulation of indigo and isatin by indole hydroxylation) was isolated which catalyses a 6.4-fold faster conversion of 0.1 mM naphthalene with 97% 1-naphthol production (2-naphthol as minor product), with the same regiospecificity as the wild type enzyme (Scheme 4). The same TOM-Green also displays a two-fold increase in TCE degradation rate and enhanced activity on 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE) and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (trans-DCE), and has enhanced catalytic activity (up to three time faster) on three-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (phenanthrene, fluorene and anthracene). The activity on the natural substrate toluene only decreased to 70% of wild type. The TOM-Green clone DNA sequence revealed 4 bp changes with three silent mutations and only one aminoacid change in tom A3: V106A in the α-subunit of hydroxylase, in a region structurally aligned with helix B of methane monooxygenase (MMO) crystal structure and corresponding to MMO L110. This was postulated to control the hydrophobic gate to the active site, both for substrate access and product release, rationalising the observed effects of V106A mutation in TOM-Green in terms of enhanced accessibility to larger substrates.</p><p>Interesting applicative outcomes can be foreseen for evolved toluene dioxygenase from P. putida engineered by random mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">65</ref> to make it produce high yields of cis-(1S, 2R)indandiol, a key precursor of indinavir sulfate or CRIX-IVAN©; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">66</ref> this is an inhibitor of HIV protease, used in clinical AIDS treatment. The natural enzyme gives an undesired product since the substrate indene reacts at the benzilic position and yields a monooxygenated by-product, 1-indenol, that amounts to up to 50% of the total reaction products. Following three rounds of mutagenesis by error prone PCR and screening with high-throughput fluorometric and spectrometric assays, the authors isolated improved variants, such as 1C4-34, with a three-fold decrease in production of undesired 1-indenol (only 20% from 60%). Although the selection procedure led to a decrease of ee of the desired cis-(1S, 2R)-indandiol versus the enantiomeric form cis-(1R, 2S )-indandiol, the chiral preference for the desired cis-(1S, 2R)-indandiol synthesis was apparently not linked to the 1-indenol yield in a positive or negative fashion, suggesting that the two properties could be evolved independently to produce the desired catalyst.</p><p>Often the requirement for rapid and efficient protein expression and high-throughput screening methods of desired activity is the key bottleneck to obtaining enzymes generated by directed evolution. A cell-free protein synthesis method, called SIMPLEX 67,68 was set up to allow the construction of enzymelibraries by combining single-step single-molecule PCR. Libraries were then screened for hydrogen peroxide-resistant variants of a haem protein, a class of biotechnologically relevant proteins whose cell-free expression in an active form is often difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">69</ref> The enzyme under study was a manganese peroxidase (MnP) from P. chrysosporium, that catalyses the oxidation of Mn 2ϩ to Mn 3ϩ and is subject to hydrogen peroxide inactivation by haem bleaching, probably linked to the production of compound III. One of the recognised advantages of cell-free system is versatility; the authors were able to modulate the SIMPLEX protocol by supplying hemin during protein synthesis and by promoting protein folding with the activity of a fungal protein disulfide isomerase. The latter has both isomerase and chaperone activities, thus yielding a high activity MnP to be assayed directly without further concentration. The variants (theoretical number: 8000) were generated by exhaustively randomising codons for three aminoacid residues (A79, N81 and I83) located near the hydrogen peroxide binding site in the MnP molecular model. The mutants were efficiently screened for improved resistance to 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide. Fifteen clones with improved resistance were isolated, identified and classified in four variant classes with fiveto nine-fold higher activity when compared to the wild type, with convergence on common substitutions, as is expected for a valid screening procedure. An improved resistance (four-fold) was also observed in clones of type 1 (A79E, N81S, I83L) compared to a single N81S mutant previously obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Transferases</head><p>Glutathione-S-transferase from mammalian cells was among the earliest targets for random mutagenesis and directed evolution. In a paper by Gulick and Fahl 70 the non specific electrophile-binding site (H site) of GST 2-2 was randomly mutated to generate structural alterations that might allow variants to detoxify more efficiently the alkylating drugs used in chemotherapy, in view of future use of somatic transgenes to protect non-tumoral cells during treatment. E. coli clones transformed with mutagenised libraries were screened for mechlorethamine resistance and nine mutants with increased resistance were isolated. These also showed an increase in turnover rates (up to 14.6-fold increase in k cat ) and catalytic constant (four to sixfold) for the conjugation reaction that triggers the detoxifying effect. On the contrary no dramatic changes were observed to K M (from 0.09 to 0.406 mM, compared to a wt value of 0.144 mM). This evolution went in parallel with a decrease in k cat /K M for two other common GST substrates (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and cumene hydroperoxide) demonstrating that a real change in substrate selectivity has occurred. Of the three focused sequence tracts mutagenised (res. 9-11; 102-112; 210-220) only residues 9-11 were variously changed in the mutants, although the rationale of amino acid variations were difficult to decipher, suggesting a reciprocal interplay between residues 9, 10 and 11. Also the over expression of all isolated variants enhances the detoxification activity, making it difficult to discriminate and rationalise the effect of aminoacid change on mechlorethamine selectivity. Mannervick and coworkers applied DNA shuffling on Theta 71 and Mu 72 class GSTs to investigate the effect of evolution addressing substrate specificity changes for recognition of broader substrate range or development of optimised variants for precise classes of reactions and target compounds. A single round of shuffling without further selection on cDNA encoding human GST T1-1 and rat GST T2-2, that share 63% identical sequence but display different substrate preferences, yielded a library in which 94 randomly picked clones were characterised for sequence expression level and specific activity on six test compounds (Scheme 5). <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">71</ref> Clone 88, i.e. variant N49D of T2-2, stands out with a 1700% increase in activity on 1-menaphthyl sulfate (MS) and 4-nitrobenzylchloride (NBC) and 60% decrease on 4-nitrophenethyl bromide (NPB). The crystal structure of human GST T2-2 (78% identical to rat) indicates that N49D is quite remote from the active site. The authors propose that Asn 49 is located in a turn where is involved in the hydrogen bonding to the preceding helix, thus establishing a rigid structure that has effects on modulation of substrate binding, catalysis and intersubunit communication throughout all the members of related GST family. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">73</ref> The N49D could therefore increase the flexibility in the newly evolved protein and this would imply an increase in the rate of product release, consistent with the observed changes in k cat and the pre-steady state burst of product formation recorded by stopped-flow. It is interesting that the entire profile of substrate range and activity is affected by such structural change and that the effect on catalytic efficiency might be profoundly different for substrates with apparently very similar structure (NBC and NPB) while enhancing both MS and NBC activities to similar levels.</p><p>The functional plasticity of GST scaffold was also confirmed by further work by the same group 74 on human GST A2-2, the side peroxidase activity of which was rationally redesigned to a steroid isomerase as will be discussed in section 4.5.</p><p>A recent paper on plant Tau class GST (GSTUs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">75</ref> was published describing the PCR based recombination and mutagenesis of sequences ZmGSTU1 and ZmGSTU2 from Zea mais, sharing a 72% sequence identity. A library of 5000 clones was expressed in E. coli, from which seven clones were isolated for improved detoxifying activity to the herbicide fluorodifen (Scheme 6) by enhanced glutathionylation from GSTU variants.</p><p>The variant proteins were purified and assayed on related herbicides fomesafen and acifluorfen (Scheme 6), as well as on GST for K M determination. The best mutant, EFD6, has an 18fold higher activity than wild type on fluorodifen and is also slightly improved to fomesafen (about 1.5-fold) and acifluorfen (four-fold). The enhancement was attributed to a single point mutation at residue 115 (Q115L), belonging to the ZmGSTU2 portion of the shuffled chimera, encompassing about 75% of the whole gene as the C-terminal portion. The 25% N-terminal sequence is instead from ZmGSTU1. The position 115 of EFD6 variant was further changed to generate variants Q115F Scheme 5 Panel of substrates detoxified with novel or enhanced activity by the evolved variants of Theta GSTs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">71</ref> The arrows indicate the sites of glutathionylation. and Q115A and also reverted to the wild type (variant 115Q EFD6). The latter confirmed the key role of mutation 115 in conferring enhanced detoxifying activity, the 115Q EFD6 variant having the same k cat /K M as wild type GSTU1 (230 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 ) and even lower than wt GSTU2 (400 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 ). Instead Q115A has a further three-fold increase in k cat /K M versus the EFD6 variant, with a value of 11700 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 . The expression of EFD6-115A in planta conferred resistance to the daily treatment with 20 µM sprayed fluorodifen over 14 days. The availability of wheat and rice GSTUs crystal structures allowed obtained variants structure and function to be related. The N-terminal domain is involved in glutathione binding while the C-terminal is involved in herbicide binding. Molecular modelling suggests that Gln115 would be too close to the trifluoromethyl group of fluorodifen to favour binding. Also the substitution of Gln with Leu might cause a rearrangement of the first helix of the C-terminal domain that would imply the movement of Lys 109 of one protomer of the dimer close to Glu 70 of the other protomer. Glu 70 is known to be involved in glutathione binding and a possible Lys-Glu salt bridging would lower affinity for glutathione. The authors do not discuss the fact that in Q115A the affinity to glutathione is substantially unchanged from GST1. They suggest that Q115 mutation might not only remove the unfavourable amide interaction to the fluorofen but also cause, to various extents, rearrangement of residues Tyr112, Thr116, Trp119, Lys120, belonging to the mentioned first helix of C-terminal domain and involved, in ZmGSTU2, in the hydrophobic site of binding for the herbicide and for its nitro group coordination (Tyr 112). A relevance to the chemistry of natural and unnatural products is also to be seen in such an approach in the possibility of co-evolution of detoxifying enzymes and selected drugs, herbicides or products to be degraded by plants expressing the above mentioned enzymes.</p><p>Other targets for evolution of highly drug resistant enzymes for cancer gene therapy are represented by alkytransferases, such as O 6 methylguanine DNA methyl transferase (MGMT). A human MGMT was randomised <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">76</ref> to generate a library (1.5 × 10 6 clones) selected for O 6 benzylguanine (BG) resistance. The 17 highly BG resistant variants were then used to transform a human hemopoietic cell line via retroviral gene transfer and the expressed mutants of MGMT tested for their ability to enhance cell survival to BG and 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNM).

The randomised library was built so that a reduced set of aminoacids would be represented in the functional enzyme. Following 22 rounds of mutagenesis the entire sequence was simplified to an overall 85% of sequence occupied by only nine types of aminoacids. Further improvement led to 88% of sequence occupied by only nine selected aminoacids and the complete absence of seven residue types, meaning only 13 aminoacids were represented. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">77</ref> Among transferases the key subclass of kinases is of paramount importance for selected conversion processes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Hydrolases</head><p>A large number of hydrolytic enzymes that have been redesigned and improved by directed evolution have an economic relevance for industrial processes or are themselves valuable commercial products. In this respect priority was given to evolution of thermostable variants 79 with enhanced resistance to organic solvents 80,81 and with expanded substrate specificity. A paper that summarised and rationalised the potentiality of directed evolution in increasing enzyme stability to thermal inactivation and organic solvent was focused on a p-nitrobenzyl esterase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">82</ref> A posteriori structural analysis of the variants pointed out how coordinated and synergic structural changes can be generated by directed evolution. These spring from mutations that are far from the active site as well as from the regions of larger structural reorganisation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The availability of crystal structures allowed the rationalisation of the effect of the overall changes of the obtained organophile and thermal stable p-nitrobenzyl esterase in terms of core packing, surface loop stability and main chain rearrangements. These are in line with the recognised theories on the features of thermophilic enzymes and it stresses how the structure of the main chain and the loops rearrange within a certain frame of conformations dictated by the α/β hydrolase structure fold. Therefore both directed and natural evolution were found to target the same regions to generate molecular diversity. Nonetheless strategies were also found to differ: laboratory evolved variants conserved loop lengths while in naturally evolved enzymes of the same family diversity was enhanced by loop length variations. This severely hinders the possibility of a rational design and/or prediction of variants, even with the availability of a high resolution crystal structure: this work highlighted a specific trend in evolutionary experiments to fix disordered regions whose crystal structure was not defined in the wild type.</p><p>Examples of improvement of proteases 22 and lipases 23,35,36 by directed evolution have already been discussed in sections 2 and 3. From a more theoretical point of view, a few examples will be given for laboratory-evolved hydrolases. Several enzymes belonging to this class are involved in fine chemical transformations and crucial reactions for the pharmaceutical industry and can be targets for the design of desired properties in developing new drug synthesis and production processes.</p><p>β-lactamases are a key example of how hydrolases were targeted by directed evolution experiments, with variously addressed approaches. The relevance of these enzymes in the context of antibiotic resistance against penicillin and cefalosporin β-lactams put these studies in the perspective of applications in diagnostics and drug development, but there are theoretical studies that are also worth mentioning. Peimbert and Segovia 83 mutated a PBP2X DD-transpeptidase by combinatorial site directed mutagenesis followed by recursive epPCR to introduce random unforeseen mutations and, after a classic shuffle round, selected variants for emergence of efficient βlactamase activity evolved by selection pressure with cefotaxime. A variant Mut E with a 10 5 higher hydrolysing rate for cefotaxime deacylation was isolated which exhibits a broad substrate specificity (both penicillins and cefalosporins) but still retains DDpeptidase activity, thus demonstrating the natural emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial strains from DDtranspeptidase enzyme variants. The three key mutations introduced (Gly336Ala, Phe450Leu and Gln452His) allow the activation of water for hydrolysis, assigning to a His452 the role of proton acceptor. The authors rationalise the results in term of a structural rearrangement of the omega loop caused by substitution within the loop itself (450 and 452) and at residue 336, that is the active site hinge point. This causes the catalysis to switch so that the stable acyl-enzyme complex undergoes a reorientation in the active site suitable for β-lactam hydrolysis by the catalytic Ser337. Directed evolution techniques were also applied to analyse the effect of a selective pressure on the evolution of TEM 1 β-lactamases variants conferring a more pronounced antibiotic resistance. This work <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">84</ref> identified three hot spots corresponding to positions G238, E104 and M182. The structural analysis suggested that variants G238S and E104K act synergistically to reorganise the position of loop 238-243 that undergoes a 2.8 Å movement stabilised by an interaction of K104 to E240 side chain. The result is an enlargement of the entrance of the active site for bulky substrates such as cephalosporins, while the M182T mutation, located in the domains hinge region, leads to a stabilisation of the rearranged structure of both variants with enhanced β-lactamase activity and with increased inhibitor resistance.</p><p>The organisation of TEM 1 β-lactamase as for succession of secondary structure is ideal for testing the potentiality of circular permutation, i.e. N-and C-termini joining and the introduction of new termini by cleaving at exposed loops. In a test case 85 variants were generated by cleaving at the position corresponding to residue 217 on a library of circular permutations with random N-C termini connecting peptides of three to five aminoacids, and the library was then scanned for retained β-lactamase activity. This drastic rearrangement of protein architecture with a new N-terminus close to the active site caused new constraints to variability by directed evolution, apparent in the possibility to select changes in positions that are forbidden to vary in wild type TEM-1 β-lactamases. Therefore circular permutation could allow directed evolution to further explore sequence space. At the same time this paper demonstrated the potentiality of directed evolution in refining and implementing applications of other techniques for theoretical and applicative protein engineering.</p><p>Two papers on the evolution of glutaryl acylase α and β subunits were recently published that bear interesting implications for applicative purposes. 86, <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">87</ref> The enzyme was forcedly evolved to change into an adipyl acylase in order to fit the requirements of a novel and interesting process of 7-aminodesacetoxycefalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) synthesis. This molecule is the key intermediate for the synthesis of semi synthetic cefalosporins. Recently a "green" alternative was proposed as a possible industrial process to substitute the chemical production of 7ADCA, by exploiting the production of adipyl-7ADCA via fermentation by P. chrysogenum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">88</ref> The key missing reaction in the process, represented by deacylation of this substrate, is the activity that the directed evolution approach aimed at developing in the target enzyme (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>).</p><p>The glutaryl acylase from Pseudomonas SY-77, both in its α and β subunits, was then subjected to random mutagenesis via epPCR targeting overlapping fragments of the encoding sequence, and the variants selected for their ability to allow growth on adipyl derivatives as the sole source of essential aminoacids (i.e. adipyl-leucine) in a defective strain. This selection method is suitable since it mirrors quite well the deacylation activity on the corresponding adipyl β lactams. Key mutations were found in selected "hot" positions, and one mutant for each subunit, namely Y178H in α and N266H in β, were found to have the highest influence on adipyl acylase activity, with gains between 3-and 10-fold. Another mutation on the β subunit, F375L, that is a more obvious region for influencing substrate specificity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">89</ref> resulted in an improved adipyl/glutaryl activity ratio, purely due to a decreased glutaryl deacylation. In spite of a minor role in substrate specificity, the substitutions in N266 with either histidine or serine were found to cause reorientation of a crucial R255 by altering the H-bond network. This residue was found to determine the correct positioning of the glutaryl moiety of the substrate in the wild type. In both cases the mutations were rationalised (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>) and suggested to redefine the arrangement of residues that hold in place the carboxylate group of the substrate. The selected variants allow a shift that can correctly position the scissile bond of the new substrate in front of the catalytic Ser 199, in spite of the varied structure and dimensions of the acyl chain. Surprisingly the mutation N266H of the β subunit also caused a two-fold increase in the activity on the original glutaryl-β lactam.</p><p>Thermal and oxidative stabilisation was also achieved by directed evolution on an N-carbamyl -aminoacid amidohydrolase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">90</ref> This is an interesting enzyme proposed for development  <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">87</ref> The precursor penicillin G is obtained via fermentation by P. chrisogenum, while adipyl-7-ADCA is produced by fermentation with adipate feed by recombinant P. chrisogenum transformed with a S. clavuligenes expandase gene. 88 Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> A: Three dimensional view (stereo-diagrams) on the positions of mutated residues identified on the β-subunit of glutaryl acylase from Pseudomonas SY-77 after selection for adipyl activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">86</ref> The catalytic Ser 199 acting on the scissile bond is indicated in blue.

The limited stability of N-carbamyl -aminoacid amidohydrolase from A. tumefaciens NRRL B11291 hinders the set up of an enzymatic process for efficient production of -aminoacids from - monosubstituted hydantoin in tandem with the relatively more stable -hydantoinase. Variants were therefore produced by three rounds of DNA shuffling starting from 10000 clones and selecting for enzyme activity after imposing severe thermal and oxidative conditions. The 10 best variants were brought forward at each successive new round of shuffling, but no improvements were observed after the third round. The best mutants (1S15 and 2S3) were selected and characterised and their structurefunction correlations rationalised by comparing the crystal structures of two N-carbamyl -aminoacid amidohydrolases that share 97-100% sequence identity with the targeted enzyme. The selection for simultaneous evolution of improved oxidative and thermal stability led to aminoacid variations that accumulated mainly on the protein surface, with the exception of M184L, mapping in the protein core. None of the five cysteines were targets for substitution, although the replacement of these residues has been reported to improve stability to oxidative conditions. The variant 1S15 displayed two changes (M184L and T262A) conserved in 2S3 that has four further mutations. The resulting improvement to strong thermal and oxidative stress (i.e. 30Ј at 70 ЊC and incubation with 0.2 mM hydrogen peroxide for 30Ј at 25 ЊC) was reflected in a retained activity of 50 to 80% after treatment versus 5-10% of residual activity of the wild type enzyme.</p><p>Other targeted hydrolases that fall into the class of industrially relevant enzymes were evolved for enhanced thermal stability, for example a β-glucuronidase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">91</ref> This is an oligomeric protein and the achieved increase in thermal stability was also discussed in terms of subtle quaternary structure modulation, since the mutations map at the tetramer interface. The lab evolution pathway showed an initial increase of thermal stability to 70 ЊC and no loss of activity. The thermal stability was then raised to 80 ЊC by DNA shuffling, but a decreased activity was measured under the optimal conditions of the wild type catalysis. This is consistent with previously proposed thermal resistance acquisition modes. 92,93, <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">94</ref> The directed evolution approach was recently applied to a hydrolase acting on organo-phosphates (OPH from Pseudomonas diminuita MG) in order to extend its substrate specificity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">95</ref> The implications of such phosphotriesterases are important in the degradation of pesticides and nerve agents (sarin, soman and VX) and the demonstrated applicability of the specific enzyme OPH for bioremediation of contaminated wastewater. <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">96</ref> The evolved variants acquired catalytic efficiencies to coumaphos-o-analogue (substrate of the first screening round), methyl-paraoxon and methyl-parathion (used in re-screening for best variants) and demeton that were comparable with or even higher than those measured on a broad range organophosphate degrading enzyme recently isolated from Agrobacterium radiobacter P230 (OPDA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">97</ref> The pattern of altered aminoacids was found to be different from that expected by merely comparing the different residues defining the active site in OPH versus OPDA. Directed evolution highlighted the only aminoacid substitution within the active site (H259R) that is relevant to the acquisition of OPDA-like substrate specificity in OPH, while the other mutations found in OPH variant are distant from the active site pocket and apparently act synergistically to stabilise the slight structural changes and enhance the activity. Two other mutations, out of the 10 observed, led to substitutions that match with the corresponding OPDA residues at aligning positions. These results stressed that directed evolution can not only mimic natural evolution but also show new routes that were not followed in nature, to enhance and modulate enzyme activity.</p><p>Directed evolution was also applied to hydrolytic enzymes of relevance for bioremediation and detoxification of recalcitrant pollutants. A test case is represented by haloalkane dehalogenase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">98</ref> A haloalkane dehalogenase from Rhodococcus sp. m15-3 was evolved in an eight-fold improvement of activity to 1,2,3trichloropropane (TCP) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>) and expressed in A. radiobacter AD1 able to grow on the reaction product (2,3-dichloro-1-propanol) as sole carbon and energy source. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">99</ref> This approach could therefore grant a bacterial strain capable of bioremediation of the highly toxic and recalcitrant pollutant TCP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Lyases</head><p>Directed evolution of lyases provides relevant examples on the ability of such techniques to develop new tools for biocatalysis. Aldolases are key targets for modification of reactivity concerning their ability to catalyse stereospecific reactions on carbohydrates. Directed evolution on variants generated by epPCR was applied to N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase to improve activity on the -enantiomers of the natural -sugar substrates. A complete inversion of enantioselectivity was obtained with three aminoacids change outside the active site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">100</ref> An interesting approach was tested on tagatose-1,6-biphosphate aldolase (TBPA) with the aim of altering the stereochemical course of a bond-forming step, instead of evolving the enzyme to accept an unnatural stereoisomer as substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">101</ref> For the first time the bond to be formed is a C-C, but this approach has been tested before on P-O bond formation, 102 reduction of carbonyl 103 and alkane hydroxylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">104</ref> Fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase (FBPA) catalyses the condensation of the same two reactants recognised by TBPA, i.e. dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) with similar reaction mechanism but completely inverted stereochemical attack (the DHAP ene-diolate intermediate attacks G3P on the Si-face in FBPA and on the Re-face in TBPA generating products that only differ in C4 stereochemistry, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). Given this observation the authors used a strategy implying generation of a library of TBPA mutants by DNA shuffling on AgaY gene from E. coli, responsible for reversible condensation of G3P and DHAP into tagatose-1,6-diphosphate, and screening for the more conveniently assayed cleavage reaction of FBP to isolate aldolase variants with reverse stereochemistry. In principle, this approach is reliable in achieving such evolution since the stereochemical course depends on the free energy of transition states leading to FBP or TBP irrespective of reaction direction. Three mutants were isolated from the 3000 clones obtained in the first generation, and were found to have one aminoacid each (D104G, S106G, H26Y) resulting in enhanced FBP cleavage. Two other variants were isolated (with mutations H26Y/D104G/V121A and H26Y/D104G/V121A/P256L respectively), in the second and third generation, achieving an 80-fold increase in k cat /K M on FBP compared to the activity of wt on TBPA, also with an associated 100-fold change in stereoselectivity. The K M values indicate that in this case the switch in reaction stereochemistry occurs through a generally broader stereospecificity. The condensation reaction to produce FBP was evaluated on the third generation mutants by monitoring with real time 31 P NMR, able to discriminate TBP from FBP production due to distinct chemical shifts. The wt enzyme generates a carbon bond with highly specific 3S,4S stereochemistry. As for mutant 3-23B5 (H26Y/D104G/V121A/P256L), the 3S,4R bond of formed FBP indicates an efficiency of synthesis of 4 : 1 for FBP versus TBP, with a very good inversion of reaction stereoselectivity. Structural explanation was given suggesting that the H26Y mutation affects the positioning of bound G3P, and mutations at 104 and 106 residues might reorient the enediolate plane with respect to the incoming carbonyl of G3P. The mutation P256L, located in the active site of the adjacent subunit, could instead alter the conformation of the substrate-binding residue R257. The synergy of these mutations would be sufficient to permit attack on the opposite face of the incoming G3P molecule. The implications are relevant for complex synthesis chemistry since this demonstrated the possibility of developing new biocatalysts able to generate rare stereoisomers of certain natural products obtained, in turn, by other wild type enzymes.</p><p>Directed evolution on benzoylformate decarboxylase from Pseudomonas putida 105 is a brilliant example of a striking improvement in enantioselectivity and the acquisition of novel activity. This thiamine diphosphate dependent enzyme and the enantio-complementary benzaldehyde lyase (BAL) from P. fluorescens can be used as biocatalysts to synthesise with high enantioselectivity the S-and R-forms of 2-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-1-one (2-HPP) and 2-HPP analogues. The selectivity of BFD for the synthesis of (S )-2-HPP (while BAL catalyses the formation of (R)-2-HPP and the ortho-, para-and meta-substitutes) is limited for the wild type by the lack of activity on ortho-substituted benzaldehyde for the acyloin-type condensation to acetaldehyde (Scheme 7).</p><p>The directed evolution approach on BFD led to the isolation of two variants (L476Q and M365L-L461S) with striking improvements both in ee, from 82 to 93%, on originally processed substrates and acquisition of novel carboligase activity on benzaldehyde ortho substitutes with methyl, methoxy-, fluoro-, chloro-and bromo-groups (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>These (S )-2-HPP ortho-substitutes were synthesised by variant L476Q with ee &gt; 99 and with 100% conversion within times suitable for preparative scale (20 h).

The double mutant instead lost the carbo-ligase activity to the original substrate, but displayed equally good ee (&gt;98%) with a degree of conversion from 46 to 100% on various ortho-substituted benzaldehydes for carboligation to acetaldehyde.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Isomerases</head><p>There are several interesting examples of applications of directed evolution to target enzymes of this class, including landmark papers on exploiting protein scaffold plasticity to accommodate different catalytic mechanisms. Although still controversial, the conceptual background of Fersht's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">106</ref> on the α/β barrel scaffold exploitation for the evolution of phosphoribosilantranilate isomerase from indole 3-glycerophosphate synthase paved the way for other experiments of catalysis mechanism switching by directed evolution. The peculiar chemistry of isomerase reactions, borrowed by other enzyme classes, makes them the key examples for this approach, although similar switching of activity was also reported on the evolution of a tyrosine phosphatase from an arsenate reductase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">107</ref> reverting the process that putatively led to the natural evolution of an arsenate resistance from phosphatase reaction chemistry.</p><p>The key point of common reaction chemistry for divergent natural evolution of enzymes is also the focus of a paper from Sterner and coworkers, 108 based on the evolution of a different catalytic activity on an α/β barrel scaffold, as for the approach mentioned above. In this case the authors were also putting to the test the so called "patchwork hypothesis" for enzyme evolution, suggesting that a common ancestor with low substrate specificity might have generated, by divergent evolution, different enzymes catalysing highly specific reactions. This would be the case for two isomerases, ProFAR isomerase (HisA) and PRA isomerase (TrpF) catalysing similar reactions in histidine and tryptophan metabolism respectively (Scheme 8).</p><p>The experimental approach aimed at generating variants of HisA from Thermotoga maritima able to act as TrpF but still retaining the original activity, thus reverting the natural evolution to produce the putative ancestor enzyme. The variant tHisA_1 was found to be originated by four substitutions, two lying close to the active site and two in far sites, acting in concert to establish a novel TrpF-like activity (although at low level) with retained HisA activity of 10% of the original k cat . The variant tHisA_2 (three aminoacids change) and the derived single mutant tHisA_Asp127Val show a complete inter-conversion of substrate specificity indicating that a single aminoacid change (Asp127Val) is responsible for the generation of two enzymes belonging to different metabolic pathways.</p><p>The active site redesign by rational directed mutagenesis was also applied to a similar catalysis switch, as for the case of a steroid double bond isomerase activity based on the GST. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">74</ref> The thiolate reaction chemistry, modified by adopting the thiol as a catalytic base in the new enzyme active site, allows the isomerisation instead of the redox reaction. The success of a rational approach is to be seen as a complement to maximise the full potential of protein engineering, as the modification of the active site often needs to be balanced distant mutations that are difficult to predict.</p><p>On a more applicative level the directed evolution of isomerases can generate variants with improved characteristics suitable for industrial processes, as in the case of xylose isomerase. This enzyme is commonly referred to as glucose isomerase and employed in the industrial conversion of glucose to fructose for example for production of syrup. The enzyme xylose isomerase from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga neapolitana (TNXI) was evolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">109</ref> to select variants with a lower temperature optimum (60 ЊC) for catalysis and an increased stability at slightly acidic conditions, in order to fit the industrial process requirements (higher temperature can generate undesired by-products and alter syrup colour), with an advantage for catalysis given by the thermostability of the parental enzyme. Two variants were isolated (3A2 and 1F1) from a library generated by random mutagenesis on a TNXI single mutant V185T, previously produced and highly active at 97 ЊC. Both mutants were found to be three-fold more active than the TNXI V185T at their optimal temperatures of 95 ЊC and 90 ЊC. The activity at 60 ЊC was 7.3 times higher for 3A2 and 12.3 times higher for 1F1 when compared to TNXI, while at 90 ЊC the enhancement in activity was limited to a maximum of 4.8 times. This was attributed to a decrease in activation energy of the novel variants (57 kJ mol Ϫ1 for 3A4 and 44 kJ mol Ϫ1 for 1F1 versus 87 kJ mol Ϫ1 of TNXI). Significantly higher k cat were measured for both variants at 60 ЊC, and although the increase of K M affected the resulting catalytic efficiency, a 2.3-fold improvement was obtained for 1F1 compared to TNXI V185T at 60 ЊC. This is an important result in view of application to industrial processes, also given the retained thermostability of the variant.</p></div>

This makes directed evolution of this class of enzymes very relevant to applications. An application of the compartmentalisation screening strategy described in section 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37</ref> led to a desirable increase of thermostability for Taq polymerase up to 11-fold compared to that of the wild type, with mutation clustering in the 5Ј-3Ј exonuclease domain in clone T8. Also variant H15 was isolated having an increased stability towards inhibition by the widely used anticoagulant heparin, a contaminant that hinders the application of PCR to clinical and forensic samples. The 130-fold enhanced resistance of clone H15 (fully active up to 1350 units heparin/ml) compared to wild type is linked to mutations (K225E, E388V, K540R, D578G, N583S, M747R) clustering in a region involved in the binding of a primer/template duplex, with no effect on the affinity for the duplex itself, but possibly decreasing affinity for heparin competitive binding. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">37</ref> From a more theoretical perspective, directed evolution was also applied to Taq DNA polymerases to test the possibility of evolving new functions such as RNA polymerase activity. In a paper from Romesberg and coworkers 110 three mutants were isolated to be efficient catalysts towards polymerisation using triphosphate ribonucleotides (rNTP) at rates comparable with those measured on the wild type using dNTPs. The variants were screened by displaying the polymerase on a filamentous phage and selecting for those able to incorporate rNTP and biotinylated UTP (assayed on a DNA template also anchored to the same phage surface) via recovery with streptavidin coated beads.</p><p>Another work from the same group is of relevant interest for biotechnological applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">111</ref> The paper describes the selection of evolved variants of polymerases able to catalyse the synthesis of 2Ј-O-methyl-modified polymers based on incorporation of rNTP. The screening procedure was similar to the one described above. The analysis of enzyme variants highlighted, for all mutated forms, the same degree of fidelity and comparable efficiency to the wild-type enzyme. The evolved enzymes maintained the essential interactions that the wt has with the DNA. The redesign of the active site, due to reorientation of critical side chains, specifically confers the novel capability of accepting the 2Ј-O-methyl-modified substrate.</p><p>Interesting implications for antiviral drugs can be foreseen in the strategy proposed in another paper 112 describing the evolution of a viral RNA polymerase from the bacteriophage T7 with specifically decreased fidelity rate (20-fold higher substitution error rate). This was achieved by carefully designing a screening procedure in which the error-prone activity is positively selected. The viral genomes are already replicated at the highest mutation rates that the viruses can tolerate, in order to maximise their infectivity. The evolved T7 polymerase was found to be able, in vivo, to interfere with the viral infection by decreasing the replication efficiency of wild type T7 bacteriophage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Economic and applicative relevance</head><p>Several recent reviews highlighted the potential of directed evolution for industrial processes in which enzymes themselves can be either the final product to be commercialised 1,2,3,113,114, <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">115</ref> or the products derived from evolved biocatalysts are used as fine chemicals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). 31,116-121 Most of the studies carried out in this field are in the process of being transferred to applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The crucial point is the timescale of the development of new enzymes by this method, that is still relatively slow when compared to the fast deadlines dictated by industry, that also require catalysts at low costs to be applied as largely as possible to many biotechnological applications. One of the leader companies in enzyme production for applications, Novozymes [<ref type="url" target="www.novo-">www.novo-</ref>zymes.com], uses an approach to molecular evolution that is combined with powerful screening techniques able to supply new enzymes with the desired improved properties. The applications span from laundry to food production, bioremediation to animal feeding. In the year 2000 the enzyme market value was estimated to be over 1.5 billion dollars divided into: 1) a large sector (65%) of the so-called "technical enzymes", that are either additives to large selling products (detergents) or fundamental tools for large scale processes in leather, textile, pulp and paper industries; 2) a sector (25%) including enzymes employed in the food industry (baking, brewing, dairy) and 3) a smaller sector (10%) applied to the production of animal feeds. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The first enzymes to be chosen as a target for improvement of activity and stability by directed evolution were the proteases, amylases, and lipases. This is clearly justified by the wide and consolidated use of their wild type forms in large selling industries, such as detergents. Proteases, alone representing 35% of the total market for industrial enzymes, 1 lipases 122 and amylases, together with glucose isomerase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">123</ref> are among the enzymes produced in the largest quantities (tons) and are used both as technical and food enzymes. It is worth noting that these enzymes were originally selected for industrial applications because of their high stability and catalytic activity, as they are in themselves excellent catalysts. Nonetheless, directed evolution offers the opportunity to explore novel sequence space and select functions and performance not achieved by natural evolution, and it was therefore used to improve even these catalysts. In these fields of application, even relatively low levels of enhancement in catalysis and/or stability under required process conditions results in substantial gain in performance and therefore in economically relevant gain. This is the case of Savinase ® (see section 2), a protease that is already suitable for commercial purposes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> where a two-to four-fold enhancement in activity after thermal treatment was obtained, together with other industrially important properties, leading to effective improvements in performance relevant to the market. Bacterial alkaline proteases have also been targets of directed evolution for industrial applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">124</ref> including the commercialisation of specific variants (Durazym from Novozymes and Purafect from Genencor International Inc.).</p><p>A landmark example of application of directed evolution to commercial lipases is represented by the work of Borchert and coworkers at Novozymes 125 on Lipolase ® that was improved in its activity in the presence of detergents. At present Novozymes commercialises two variants of Lipolase ® obtained by protein engineering, Lipolase ® Ultra and LipoPrime, that also find applications in laundry detergents.</p><p>A recent work was published by a research group at Henkel <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">126</ref> describing the directed evolution of an amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, for improvement of activity at the alkaline pH required for industrial processes in starch conversion, the pulp and paper industry and as a detergent additive. Error prone PCR and shuffling of the wt protein with two single mutants (S201N and N297D) led to the isolation of a variant showing a five-fold increase in activity at pH 10, while a second variant showing no changes in pH dependence was instead found to have a specific activity nine-fold higher than that of the wt.</p><p>Amylosucrase, an enzyme with potential in the field of modification of polysaccharides, was also evolved to have a five-fold improvement in its activity towards sucrose. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">127</ref> Other examples of industrially relevant targets improved by directed evolution include enzymes such as laccases, used in the textile and paper industries, 128 cellulases, hemicellulases, β-glycosidases 129 and endoglucanases evolved for thermostability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">130</ref> Interestingly, the requirements for industrial processes include the evolution of enzymes from thermophilic organisms to obtain catalysts that also display optimal activity at lower temperatures. Phytase was also evolved to produce a "consensus phytase", 131 that represents a good example of a product from directed evolution transferred to the market: this enzyme has a significant economic impact, given its relevance for animal feeding, for releasing phosphorus and sequestered metals from plant phytate present at high percentages (50 to 80%) in pig and poultry feeds.</p><p>The chemical and pharmaceutical industries are mostly interested in the fine tuning of enzymatic properties for biocatalysis, a field where directed evolution counts several approaches and successful results, although not as many have been transferred to industrial processes. Several examples are reported of how directed evolution fits into the landscape of enzyme-based biocatalysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">118</ref> The major areas of interest are chiral and asymmetric synthesis, 132,133 involving lipases, esterases and phospholipases. 134, <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">135</ref> The group of Reetz reported several examples of directed evolution applied to enhance the enantioselectivity of lipases. Several screening methods were designed by the same group in order to optimise the required properties of lipases and esterases with great relevance to selected synthesis of enantiopure intermediates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[136]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[137]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[138]</ref> An interesting new development suggested by Reetz concerns the appli-cation of directed evolution to develop hybrid catalysts for organic synthesis that cannot be enzymatically addressed at present. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">120</ref> This would require the implantation of transition metal centres suitable for selected organic transformations in a protein scaffold that would be able to tune chemo-, stereo and regio-selectivity, thus combining the power of organo-metallic and enzyme chemistry. The directed evolution approach would provide such hybrids with both the required plethora of scaffold variants and the screening methods for selective evolution of the best catalysts.</p><p>A considerable economic interest is also to be seen in potential applications of directed evolution to the development of novel or improved proteins to be used as biotherapeutics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">139</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Relevance for nanobiotechnology and biosensors</head><p>Nanobiotechnology is a fast growing field of application where biomolecules are exploited for their intrinsically occurring functions at the nano-scale. In this respect directed evolution is a tool that holds great promise in being able to deliver proteins and enzymes designed and suited for specific applications. We already have seen key areas such as redox protein engineering combined with bioelectrochemistry showing a clear direction for exploitation. 140, <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">141</ref> Directed evolution was applied earlier to the well characterised green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria. <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">142</ref> The intrinsic fluorophore present in GFP makes this protein a good reporter molecule. This has been linked to a calmodulin-based calcium sensor in which fluorescence resonance energy transfer is triggered by the large conformational changes occurring in calmodulin. A similar approach was applied to other protein-ligand systems that do not show conformational changes; for example the GFP was fused to a β-lactamase (Bla) gene so that this enzyme is inserted in an exposed loop of the GFP without structural-functional alterations and able to influence the fluorescence signal upon binding. In this case the ligand was represented by the β-Lactamase Inhibitory Protein (BLIP). The fusion protein GFP::Bla was subjected to random mutagenesis by epPCR and the library easily screened for fluorescent colonies expressing both the library and BLIP gene product. The GFP::Bla 1 variant was isolated and found to bear two point mutations in the Bla gene region (M681I and V108I). This retained the penicillinase activity with a k cat /K M of 2 × 10 6 M Ϫ1 s Ϫ1 , only one order of magnitude lower than that of the wild type Bla, and it was inhibited by BLIP with a K i of 0.2 µM, consistent with the K d of 0.35 µM determined independently by fluorescence. This paves the way to other applications such as various protein-ligand interaction sensing, ranging from hormones to metal detection in vitro and in vivo. A more recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">143</ref> applied directed evolution to the development of improved variants of a bacteriorodopsin (BR) from Halobacter salinarium for the development of commercially suitable optical memories configured in various devices from thin-film photochromic to Fourier transform holographic associative storage systems and branched-photocycle 3D-optical memories. The variables involved in bacteriorodopsin performance in such applications are difficult to rationalise in terms of protein structure, and limited information can be obtained from modelling approaches. For example in applications such as branchedphotocycle 3D-optical memories, improvements of bacteriorodopsin performance can be obtained by the synergic effect of minimal formation time and optimised decay of the O state, maximal quantum efficiency of photochemical transformation of O state to generate the first product of branching reaction (P), maximal efficiency of formation and high stability of the data storing Q state. Therefore, directed evolution of random or semi-random mutants is the election strategy to obtain further improvements <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">143</ref> (to date up to 700-fold) of the performance of bacteriorodopsin as a volumetric memory medium for data storage.</p><p>A very recent review <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">144</ref> foresees the application of directed evolution to redox enzymes for coupling to electrode surfaces and application to enzyme mediated electrocatalysis and sensing. In this respect interesting candidates are glucose oxidases, 145-147 laccases 148-151 and cytochrome P450s. <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">152</ref> The projects developed by our group in this field provide tools for the application of directed evolution to nanobiotechnology. The combination of the "Molecular Lego" approach that aims to create artificial redox chains linked to electrode via flavodoxin, 153,154 together with the electrochemistry of engineered P450s 152 and the application of the "alkali assay" screening method <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">34</ref> allowing screening for active P450 variants, provides an interesting synergic combination of directed evolution and rational design to create a novel generation of sensors based on laboratory evolved variants of P450s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>The application of directed evolution to proteins and enzymes relevant to the fields of natural and unnatural product chemistry has already generated important achievements. A range of biocatalysts with novel and improved activity are now available for the most diverse synthesis and activities, from fine chemistry to laundry. The potential of enzymes as alternatives to classical chemical catalysts is today recognised <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">155</ref> and is increasingly being implemented in industrial processes. Looking ahead into the future, the next challenge is to put to the test directed evolution in order to achieve extended coverage of organic synthesis by biocatalysts. In parallel the increasing number of enzymecatalysed reactions being scaled-up and developed as industrial processes will dictate novel requirements to the experimentalist in terms of enzyme stabilisation and tuning of activity. In terms of large-selling industrial biocatalysts, such as commercial lipases, proteases, esterases and phytases (Savinase ® , Lipolase ® Ultra and LipoPrime), the driving force imposed by the market is expected to lead further improvements by directed evolution, that was already demonstrated to be able to achieve unusually high levels of catalytic efficiency, even on excellent wild type biocatalysts.</p><p>Applications of directed evolution were recently foreseen 156 in one of the major organic chemistry reactions, the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, a good example of asymmetric synthesis in which enzymes, NAD(P)H-and flavin-dependent "Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases" (BVMO), greatly improved production with high ee values of complex organic molecules and key intermediates such as optically pure esters, lactones and sulfoxides. The application of BMVOs as isolate enzymes still finds limitations in enzyme stability and cofactor regeneration costs that can successfully be tackled further by directed evolution.</p><p>The selected examples of evolved variants of haloalkane dehalogenase, 99 toluene monooxygenase, 64 biphenyl dioxygenases 54,55, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">56</ref> and glutathione-S-transferase 75 demonstrated that another promising field of further development and application of evolved enzymes is detoxification of recalcitrant xenobiotics, with implications for bioremediation and environmental protection, but also with interesting links to pollution monitoring and biosensing. The screening procedures required for desired mutant identification and the large amount of variants with subtle differences in molecular recognition properties are within themselves excellent bases for the evolution of desired sensors in array format.</p><p>Multiple application fields are emerging for evolved variants in health-care, for protein-therapy, drug discovery and cell-protection against compounds applied in chemotherapy. In diagnostics, as in pollution monitoring, a combination of protein directed evolution with sensors and protein arrays development will be the research frontline in the near future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Fig. 2 Molecular diversity is obtained starting from a library of random mutants and a pool of homologous genes.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,58.81,65.22,235.44,323.28" type="bitmap" /></figure>
