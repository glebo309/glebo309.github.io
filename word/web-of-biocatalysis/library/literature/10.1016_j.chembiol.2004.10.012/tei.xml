Single Mutations Closer to the Active Site Increase Enantioselectivity More Strongly than Single Distant Mutations, but Closer Amino Acids Are Rarer than Distant Ones (A) Location of single mutations that increase enzyme enantioselectivity as identified by rational design (solid symbols) or directed evolution (outline symbols). The distance is from the Cα of the mutated amino acid to the stereocenter of the substrate bound to the enzyme or to a key active site residue. The closest contact may be shorter, depending on side chain orientations. The observed enantioselectivity changes are given as activation energy differences (⌬⌬⌬G ‡ ) to simplify comparison. Although the molecular details differ for each case, closer mutations increase enantioselectivity more strongly than distant mutations. The literature data for this figure are included as Supplemental Data (available with this article online). (B) The number of amino acids in each 1 Å thick shell increases with the radius of the shell. The line shows the predicted values for a spherical enzyme with an active site in the center; see Equation 2 in the text. The points correspond to the observed numbers in the X-ray crystal structures of lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAL, circles) and esterase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PFE, triangles). The distances are between Cα of the amino acid residues and the stereocenter of a modeled bound substrate (a 2-methyl carboxylic acid ester). The observed numbers fit the predicted line well up to w16 Å, but are lower than predicted beyond w16 Å because one reaches the edge of the protein. The number of amino acids is for each thin shell and is not cumulative. For this reason, it decreases as the shells extend beyond the protein. More than half of the amino acid residues in these enzymes are 13-22 Å from the active site, and &lt;10% lie within 10 Å of the active site.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,42.78,92.46,287.81,319.48" type="bitmap" /></figure>

If the enantioselectivity increase in the mutants stems mainly wild-type PFE stems from a lower k cat for the slowreacting R-enantiomer of MBMP.

Indeed, this was the similar for both enantiomers (50 mM for [S] versus 80 mM for [R]), while k cat is significantly higher for the fast-case (Table3). For Trp28Leu, the enantioselectivity increase from wild-type was 0.93 kcal/mol (from E = 12 reacting enantiomer (1900 min -1 for [S] versus 340 min -1 for [R]).

These results suggest that the enantioselectivity increases of these reaction rate of the fast-reacting enantiomer, but mainly by further slowing the reaction rate of the slow-reacting mutants toward MBMP stem mainly from electronic interactions between the bromomethyl substituent and enantiomer (Table 2). The k cat values for the fast-reacting enantiomer (3500 min -1 for Trp28Leu, 3300 min -1 for PFE. To test the contribution of steric effects, we used Val121Ser) were about 2-fold higher than for wild-type (1900 min -1 ), and the K M values were all similar (70 mM compound 3, in which the isosteric methyl group replaces the bromo group of MBMP.

We propose that this change removes a repulsive electronic interaction between the strate for wild-type PFE, or any of the mutants. This lack of reactivity is consistent with a sterically restricted electron-rich indole ring [46] of Trp28 and the electronegative bromomethyl group and thus favors rotamers acyl binding site in PFE, as suggested by previous substrate mapping [45]. in which the bromomethyl group lies nearest position 28.
