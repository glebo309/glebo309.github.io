<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes catalyze a variety of reactions and convert chemicals to potentially reactive products as well as make compounds less toxic. Most of the P450 reactions are oxidations. The majority of these can be rationalized in the context of an FeO 3+ intermediate and odd electron abstraction/rebound mechanisms; however, other iron-oxygen complexes are possible and alternate chemistries can be considered. Another issue regarding P450-catalyzed reactions is the delineation of rate-limiting steps in the catalytic cycle and the contribution to reaction selectivity. In addition to the rather classical oxidations, P450s also catalyze less generally discussed reactions including reduction, desaturation, ester cleavage, ring expansion, ring formation, aldehyde scission, dehydration, ipso attack, one-electron oxidation, coupling reactions, rearrangement of fatty acid and prostaglandin hydroperoxides, and phospholipase activity. Most of these reactions are rationalized in the context of high-valent iron-oxygen intermediates and Fe 2+ reductions, but others are not and may involve acid-base catalysis. Some of these transformations are involved in the bioactivation and detoxication of xenobiotic chemicals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>P450 enzymes are the major catalysts involved in the oxidation of xenobiotic chemicals, a significant focus of scientists in the areas of toxicology, drug metabolism, and pharmacology. The effects of these oxidations can be manifested in poor drug bioavailability and various acute and chronic toxicities, including adverse drug interactions, cancer susceptibility, and birth defects. Information about which human P450 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of new drug candidates is required for new drug approval submissions in most countries, and information about the induction of P450s is a part of largescale toxicogenomics efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</p><p>The field has certainly advanced in the 27 years since the author entered it, and some explanation should be given about the impetus for this review. I began this review at the suggestion of the feature editor, Paul Hollenberg. Although I have written a number of reviews on several aspects of P450 research over the past two decades, the only one I wrote for Chemical Research in Toxicology was with Tsutomu Shimada in 1991 on the subject of metabolism of carcinogens by human P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. It occurred to me that an entire generation has passed since Professor Hollenberg and I began our own studies on P450s. I have a reasonably good idea about what most students and postdoctoral trainees at Vanderbilt know about P450 by the time they leave, for better or worse. However, in interactions with trainees at other institutions and with scientists in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries I have found a great diversity of backgrounds.</p><p>To me, the metabolism of xenobiotic chemicals has always been an interesting field of research. Some of my more biologically oriented colleagues seem to have the view that all aspects of metabolism were discovered by 1960, give or take a few years. However, the continuing onslaught of new xenobiotics has provided a tremendous source of new projects and also yielded needs for new explanations. Much of this continuing search with xenobiotics has had major "spin-offs" in the generation of important biological signaling agents, e.g., nitric oxide synthase. Many students learn some fundamentals of P450 enzymology in drug metabolism or toxicology courses, if they have taken these. My impression is that most university-based programs in the general area deal with some of the more fundamental types of P450 reactions, e.g., carbon hydroxylation, epoxidation, and a few others. However, in the actual practice of xenobiotic metabolism researchers are confronted by numerous "unusual" reactions that they may not understand or be able to retrieve examples of from the literature. In some recent cases, the author has not been able to resolve some issues encountered in practical pharmaceutical problems, and new paradigms continue to be added to our repertoire.</p><p>In the past 5 years, several reviews of the catalytic mechanisms of P450s have been published, both brief (4-10) and more extensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12)</ref>. In particular, the comprehensive review of Ortiz de Montellano <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref> is recommended; it discusses most aspects in detail. The present review will touch on the fundamentals of general P450 mechanistic enzymology, with some added discussion of a personal interest that has not been reviewed recently, i.e., the nature of rate-limiting steps in reactions catalyzed by mammalian P450s. When one has a fundamental knowledge of how P450s work, most of its reactions can be understood, or at least rationalized. The bulk of the review will be devoted to a series of somewhat unusual P450 reactions, divided into 13 types. Most of these were unknown 25 years ago. Many are included in the extensive treatments of Ortiz de Montellano <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref> and Testa <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In this review I have several purposes regarding these reactions: (i) to update the two 1995 treatments just mentioned, (ii) to stimulate P450 practitioners to learn more about some of the apparent diversity of the repertoire of the P450 family, and (iii) to interest the readers in reading and learning more about the chemistry of these interesting enzymes. The scientific views I present here are based on my own research, my own experience, and my interpretations of the work of others. The approach I will use in presenting the article is based on my experience teaching classes at Vanderbilt, my experiences with my own students and postdoctoral fellows, and my experience in consulting with the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">General Information about Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</head><p>Mixed-function oxidations were first observed in the late 1940s (14-18) but the enzymology was not characterized for a number of years. P450 Fe 2+ ‚CO spectra were reported in 1958 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>; Sato and Omura published on some additional properties of the system in 1962 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and developed the name P450 (first used with the hyphen, "P-450") for "pigment 450" because of the A max at 450 nm. A classical series of light reversal (of CO inhibition) studies by <ref type="bibr">Estabrook and Cooper (21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref> established a P450 as the terminal oxidase in an adrenal steroid hydroxylation. Several lines of investigation in the 1960s, mainly involving induction experiments in rats, led to the view that multiple forms of P450 might exist within a single tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>.</p><p>P450 enzymes were originally discovered through independent research activities involving the metabolism of carcinogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref>, and steroids <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. All of these areas are of interest in issues related to toxicology. Other substrates of note include pesticides, fat-soluble vitamins, and endogenous compounds such as eicosanoids and mammalian alkaloids <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. The general reaction catalyzed by P450s is one of mixed-function oxidation (eq 1) although we will see several exceptions later.</p><p>2.1. Nomenclature and Distribution. Following the basic characterization of the nature of the mammalian P450 system, evidence for the existence of more than one form of microsomal P450 began to accumulate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The first successful purification and reconstitution of a P450 system by Lu and Coon <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> was followed by extensive efforts in a number of laboratories to purify P450s from experimental animals and, later, from humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. These efforts led to a considerable collection of P450s and information about their catalytic activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>. Soon after the cDNA cloning work on P450s began in earnest, the nomenclature system was systematized <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. On the basis of sequence identity, P450s are grouped into families (1, 2, 3, ...), subfamilies (A, B, C, ...), and individual P450s (1, 2, 3, ...), e.g., 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, ... For more discussion the reader is referred to the current approach to the nomenclature at the website <ref type="url" target="http://drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html">http://drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html</ref> (site accessed <ref type="bibr">April 20, 2001)</ref>. A compilation of the allelic variants of human P450s is maintained at <ref type="url" target="http://www.imm.ki.se/CYPalleles/">http://  www.imm.ki.se/CYPalleles/</ref> (site accessed <ref type="bibr">April 20, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>P450s are found throughout nature. With the near completion of the sequences in the human genome, the number of human P450s seems to be about 53 and will not change much in the future. For comparison, there are probably at least 20 human glutathione transferases <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. With regard to the number of P450 genes in other organisms, even the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis has ∼20, the model nematode (rootworm) Caenorhabditis elegans has 80, Drosophila has 83, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana has 286 (but the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has only 3 and the bacterium Escherichia coli has none). Many of the P450s (in mammalian organisms) are devoted to the biosynthesis of specific natural products. In plants, many of these chemicals are used for coloration or defense. Mammals appear to use a smaller set of P450s in that many of the functions are in the catabolism of natural products, aside from the synthesis of important steroids and eicosanoids (e.g., <ref type="bibr">P450s 5, 8, 11, 17, 19, 21, 24, 26, and 27)</ref>. Of the remainder of the mammalian P450s, a relatively small set accounts for most of the metabolism of drugs (i.e., 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4) and another small set is involved in the metabolism of most of pro-toxicants and -carcinogens that are P450 substrates (i.e., 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2E1, and 3A4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>. Similar subfamily P450s are found in experimental animals, although the catalytic selectivity may be altered <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>.</p><p>The majority of the P450s to be discussed are concentrated in liver (except 1A1 and 1B1). However, many of these P450s are also found in some extrahepatic tissues and the actions of these within a target tissue may be more important, particularly if a generated reactive product is not stable enough to migrate out of the cell in which it is formed <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. The P450s of interest here are all found in the endoplasmic reticulum (isolated as "microsomes"). Avadhani and his associates have identified mechanisms by which proteolytic cleavage in the N-termini of some microsomal P450s can "mark" these for import into mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, or phosphorylation of a Ser of rat P450 2B1 can signal the transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. In mitochondria these P450s can utilize electrons from the iron-sulfur protein adrenodoxin instead of NADPH-P450 reductase <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. The fraction of the pool of some P450s that can move to the mitochondria is considerable in some cases, e.g., <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> / 3 for P450 1A1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. Small amounts of some P450s are also able to be translocated to the outside of the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>, where they may be important in the development of immune responses. In the 1970s the concept was advanced that P450s in the nucleus would be more likely to generate reactive products capable of DNA alkylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>. However, despite a flurry of interest in this area, there appears to be little basis, for two reasons. (i) The nuclear P450s are located in the outer nuclear membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>, which is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum. (ii) Today we know that many reactive chemicals [e.g., aflatoxin exo-8,9-epoxide, t 1/2 1 s <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref>] are able to cross cell membranes and would probably have no trouble entering porous nuclei.</p><p>Many P450s are inducible by chemicals; the inducer may also be a substrate but this is not necessarily the case. Some excellent inducers (e.g., 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) are very poor substrates. The most common pattern of P450 induction is a transcriptional one in which a ligand binds to activate a heterodimer, ultimately stimulating RNA synthesis from specific genes. However, in some systems there is posttranscriptional control <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref> and in other cases a chemical may act by increasing the synthesis of a receptor or transport into the nucleus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Structures of P450s.</head><p>The first three-dimensional structure of a P450, that of bacterial P450 101, was reported by <ref type="bibr">Poulos in 1987 (59)</ref>. At this time, structures of at least eight different P450s are known. Of these, six are now published <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. All but one are of soluble enzymes, and all but two are of bacterial origin. One is from Fusarium (mold) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref> and one is a modified rabbit P450 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. The reader is referred to the original papers (vide supra) for reference to the actual structures and to discussion of exactly what one can conclude from the structural results (particularly, see refs <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</p><p>All of the P450 structures have common elements and have some similarity at a gross level. The proteins are arranged into a similar series of helices and folds, with well-conserved helices denoted A-L. The I and L helices contact the heme. Residues in the B and I helices also contact substrate, and site-directed mutations in these regions have had some dramatic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. Another region contacting the substrate is the F helix, where mutations can also influence catalytic selectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(73)</ref>. Other structural, homology modeling, and sitedirected mutagenesis work supports the original proposal by <ref type="bibr">Gotoh (74)</ref> that the six "substrate recognition sequences" (SRS, 1 three already cited) are generally conserved among most P450s.</p><p>The most conserved part of the P450 sequence is in the region containing the Cys that acts as the thiolate ligand to the heme iron (Cys 357 in P450 101). This sequence is used as the identifier of P450s in gene banks. Another highly conserved residue is a Thr corresponding to Thr 252 in bacterial P450 101, which has been postulated to have a variety of functions. The Thr may donate a proton to the Fe 2+ O 2 -complex to facilitate (heterolytic) cleavage of the O-O bond. Arguments against the general need for such an activity include the high pK a of Thr, the absence of this Thr in some P450s, and the retention of function of P450 101 in which a Thr O-methyl ether was substituted using mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75)</ref>. The dominant view today is that the Thr and its neighboring Glu are part of a proton relay system that is useful but not absolutely necessary in all P450s. In P450 108 (P450eryF), the substrate binds and then mobilizes H 2 O to serve the same function <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>.</p><p>Crystal structures in themselves do not necessarily provide information about function. Indeed, some of the P450s for which structures are available are not characterized with regard to their electron donor or substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>. The P450 101 structure has provided the greatest amount of information, in part because of the wealth of knowledge that existed about protein interactions, substrate specificity, and kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>. Recently, timeresolved crystallographic approaches have been used to obtain structures of distinct redox forms of P450 101 during the catalytic cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>. Although the structures of the latter intermediates are not as clear and the molecular identity is not as certain, insight is provided into the structural changes that can occur in the course of P450 reaction. Changes in the structure near the active site occur at every step of the reaction. To some extent then, we can consider each of the redox forms as a slightly different enzyme in the context of binding ligands, etc. In P450 102 there is a long, open substrate channel; conformational changes are also required <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79)</ref>. However, with several of the other P450s, the substrate is completely enclosed by the protein [e.g., P450s 101, 107, 108, 2C5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79)</ref>], and obviously a major rearrangement of the protein is necessary. This rearrangement is not well understood, even in P450 101, and has only been approached from molecular dynamics simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81)</ref>. A key question is how fast the protein motion is and exactly where the substrate is bound. A structural change is also required for the product to leave, and similar questions can be raised. Also, the question arises as to whether the product and substrate follow the same paths in entering and leaving <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, the structure of an Archebacteria P450, P450 119, has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. Of particular interest are the differences between the structures in the absence and presence of the nitrogenous heme ligand 4-phenylimidazole. These differences, along with the changes in structures mentioned above due to the presence of substrate, raise the possibility that P450s may have some "induced fit" properties and be able to accommodate diverse substrates in this way. However, comparison of more structures with different ligands will be necessary to provide evidence for this view.</p><p>The acquistion of a structure of a mammalian P450 was a very useful development. Rabbit P450 2C5 was modified to increase the level of heterologous expression and decrease aggregation <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84)</ref>, yielding a protein that could be crystallized in the absence of detergents <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. Molecular anomolous dispersion phasing using synchroton radiation was required to solve the structure. The structure is of considerable interest in terms of modeling of other mammalian P450s. In this regard, the structure has been compared to that of P450 102, which has already been employed extensively and shows the greatest similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. The spatial arrangement of the major elements diverges from the other structures, with SRS-4 being the most conserved compared to P450 102. SRS-5 diverges significantly, with 3.3 Å root-mean-square deviation, and the shape of the base of the active site is significantly different, affecting the orientation and position of substrates as well as selectivity for different substrates. This is not surprising, in that the substrates of P450 102 and 2C5 are fatty acids and steroids, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86)</ref>. The spatial organization of SRS regions 1, 2, 3, and 6 also diverges from P450 102 (4.5-6.0 Å). The high-temperature factors of the P450 2C5 B-C loop might be indicative of dynamic fluctuations related to passage of substrates through this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>.</p><p>The original P450 2C5 structure seems to indicate a bound ligand, although no substrate was added. It is possible that this is a reagent utilized in the work (e.g., dithiothreitol). The substrate binding cavity is slightly larger than that for camphor in P450 101 (360 Å 3 ) (64), and progesterone was readily docked into this site.</p><p>Many P450 modeling efforts have been published, based first on P450 101 and subsequently on P450 102 or aggregate models of the known structures. Undoubtedly, structure modeling will now also be based upon P450 2C5. The usefulness of modeling details of ligand interaction remains to be demonstrated, particularly with P450s outside of the 2C subfamily.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Roles of P450s in Drug Metabolism</head><p>. Aside from issues of potential toxicity, the major issue with P450 regarding drug metabolism is bioavailability. P450 catalysis will lower the plasma concentration of a drug and also the concentration of the drug at the target site. Metabolism (by P450s or other enzymes) is not the only issue in bioavailability (also absorption and other factors), but it is one that scientists in the pharmaceutical industry would like to be able to predict better. Poor bioavailability is one of the most common reasons why new chemical entities from drug discovery fail to reach the market, and there is great interest in developing better in vitro predictive methods.</p><p>A second but less common role of P450s in drug metabolism is the P450-catalyzed oxidation of drugs to their active forms. This process might involve conversion of a pro-drug to an active form. Approaches are under consideration for the use of gene therapy in cancer chemotherapy as a means of selective delivery of alkylating agents to tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref>. A more common scenario involves the conversion of a drug with some inherent activity to a much more active form. Examples include losartan (P450 2C9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89)</ref> and encainide (P450 2D6) <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>. This type of behavior is often unrecognized until experiments are initiated in vivo. The discovery of such active metabolites provides new leads for the discovery process.</p><p>2.4. Roles of P450s in Chemical Toxicity. The following discussion applies to all xenobiotic chemicals, including drugs, pesticides, carcinogens, and any other chemical with potential toxicity (which according to Paracelsus would be all chemicals, whether xenobiotic or endobiotic). The particular scenario depends on the mechanism of toxicity and, of course, the dose.</p><p>If the administered chemical has a direct toxicity of its own (or acts directly on a receptor to produce toxicity), then metabolism of the compound may reduce toxicity, if the P450-generated product has less inherent toxicity. Good examples include many drugs, e.g., terfenadine <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref>. With drugs, toxicity is often the result of exaggerated pharmacological response of the drug itself.</p><p>Another case, also very common, is the transformation of an administered chemical to another that either (i) binds covalently to macromolecules (usually because of its electrophilic or other reactive nature) or (ii) otherwise interacts with a target to cause toxicity. An example for part i would be conversion of hexane to 2,5-hexanedione, which reacts with protein lysines to generate pyrroles <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(92)</ref>. An example of ii would be the hydroxylation of trimethylpentane to an alcohol that binds tightly to R 2umicroglobulin to produce droplets in male rat kidneys (and ultimately tumors) <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(93)</ref>. Examples i and ii are also (usually) distinguished by (i) their capability for genotoxic response vs (ii) tendency to act by causing increased cell proliferation, although these two phenomena are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Another mode of P450-caused toxicity involves mechanism-based (or "suicide") inactivation of P450s, which is not an unusual phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95)</ref>. This is not necessarily equated with toxicity because, in the case of this phenomenon, only the P450 involved in the activation is destroyed. However, this inactivation may yield a problem in terms of drug-drug interactions, as would even strong competitive inhibition of a P450. For example, inhibition of P450 3A4 by any mechanism can lead to impaired oxidation of terfenadine (to fexofenadine) and its accumulation, resulting in arrhythmias in some individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref>. Another aspect of mechanism-based inactivation is that modified P450s may have toxicities of their own. For instance, N-alkyl heme products ("green pigments") can disrupt porphyrin synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94)</ref>. P450s covalently modified with chemicals may behave as antigens and induce auto-immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(96,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97)</ref>. This latter response is correlated with some types of hepatitis, although a causal relationship has not been demonstrated.</p><p>The list of potential DNA, lipid, and protein targets for reaction with reactive electrophiles and radicals is extensive. With lipids, there is some understanding of the consequences of lipid peroxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(98)</ref>. With DNA, understanding at least some of the most relevant gene responses and their mechanisms is becoming possible. In the reaction of electrophiles with proteins, sites of reaction are being defined but establishing biological significance has been difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100)</ref>. An additional complication we have recently dealt with is the instability of protein adducts, as exemplified by the reaction of proteins with acyl halides derived from trichloroethylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">General Features of Catalysis</head><p>In this section, we will briefly examine some of the base of P450 catalysis, beginning with a general treatment of the reaction cycle, followed by a somewhat classical and unified approach to the oxygenation step, and consideration of alternative chemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">General Aspects of the Catalytic Cycle.</head><p>Most scientists in the field agree that the major events in P450 catalysis are those shown in Scheme 1. These will be presented briefly because they have been treated extensively elsewhere and a discussion of the rate-limiting nature of individual steps follows (section 3.3).</p><p>The cycle begins with P450 iron in the ferric state. In step 1, the substrate binds to the enzyme, somewhere near the distal region of the heme. This step may or may not involve a change in the iron spin state (some P450s have low-spin P450 in the substrate-free state; some are high-spin). Step 1 may or may not facilitate step 2, depending on the P450 (103); step 1 is shown before 2 because it is faster, even when the kinetics of step 2 are independent of whether substrate is bound. The electrons come from NADPH via the accessory flavoprotein NADPH-P450 reductase, with the flow going from the reductase prosthetic group FAD to FMN to the P450. For further details of electron transfer through the flavins see <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(104)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(105)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(106)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(107)</ref>. There appear to be few exceptions to NADPH-P450 reductase as the electron donor. Unnatural donors such as ferredoxins and flavodoxins will work in artificial systems but only relatively slowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(108,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">109)</ref>. The one natural exception among the "microsomal" P450s is the truncated forms of some that are subsequently targeted to mitochondria and appear to use adrenodoxin as an electron donor <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>.</p><p>Ferrous P450 binds O 2 (step 3). This complex is unstable and can generate ferric iron and superoxide anion, O 2 •-. The Fe 2+ ‚O 2 complex has been observed in microsomal P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(110)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(111)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(112)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(113)</ref>, but beyond this step, the characterization of intermediates is less certain. Inferences have come from some work with bacterial P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">114)</ref> and peroxidases and biomimetic model metalloporphyrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(115)</ref>. A second electron enters the system in step 4. This may come from NADPH-P450 reductase or, in some cases, from cytochrome b 5 (b 5 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(116,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">117)</ref>. [b 5 is rather inefficient in supplying the first electron, probably because the first reduction is thermodynamically more difficult than the second <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(117)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(118)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(120)</ref>.] A proton is added in step 5, and the O-O bond is cleaved in step 6, generating H 2 O (with the addition of a proton) and an entity shown as FeO 3+ . This high-valent complex can be a Fe ) iron atom in P450 heme, RH ) substrate, ROH ) product, ox and red indicate the reduced and (1-electron) oxidized states of the reductase involved in the electron transfers (see text).</p><p>written as Fe V dO but the precise electronic configuration is unknown. With reference to the precedent of peroxidase compound I, which is stable and has been extensively characterized, the most general view is that the iron is Fe 4+ and the porphyrin ring is one-electron deficient (Fe 4+ O 2 -porph ‚+ ).</p><p>The FeO 3+ complex can be used to rationalize most of the P450 reactions, although alternate possibilities will be considered later. In step 7 this electron-deficient complex either abstracts a hydrogen atom or an electron from the substrate or else forms a sigma complex with the substrate (vide infra). A subsequent collapse of the intermediate or intermediate pair in step 8 generates the product. (In the case of a hydrogen abstraction mechanism, step 8 is referred to as an "oxygen rebound.") In step 9, the product dissociates from the enzyme.</p><p>In artificial systems, an "oxygen surrogate" (R′O or R′OOH) may be used to convert the ferric iron to one of the high-valent iron-oxygen complexes (Scheme 1). As we will see later, some of these reactions are relevant to the "unusual" reactions of P450s.</p><p>Even with nine steps, the paradigm presented in Scheme 1 is an overall simplification. A slightly expanded version is shown in Scheme 2 with some, but not all, of the transformations that can be involved in the reduction of O 2 without product formation. Another important point to consider is that Schemes 1 and 2 make no provision for important conformational changes. In the case of bacterial P450 101, time-resolved crystallographic studies show changes at each identifiable step of the catalytic cycle (vide supra) (78).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Rationalization of Major</head><p>Reactions with a General Mechanism. In the early history of the P450 field, there were various proposals to explain P450 catalysis, including the generation of mobile oxidants such as O 2 •-that could react directly with substrates in P450 cavities <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(121)</ref>. In the period 1978-1980, a number of studies, driven primarily by Groves' work with biomimetic models and rabbit P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">123)</ref>, led to the development of the system discussed above, in which FeO 3+ , the "equivalent" of peroxidase compound I, abstracts a hydrogen atom and then completes the reaction by a radical recombination (oxygen rebound) (Scheme 3).</p><p>This scheme was expanded somewhat with the view that the putative FeO 3+ complex could also abstract nonbonded electrons, which seemed very reasonable in light of the measured high oxidation-reduction potential (E 1/2 ) values of horseradish peroxidase compounds I and II <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(124)</ref> and subsequent work by Ortiz de Montellano and our own group on one-electron oxidations <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(125)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(126)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(127)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">(128)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(129)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(130)</ref>.

This system will be presented briefly, with some revision of our first major review <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(131)</ref>. This systematic approach does not consider all of the alternative mechanisms proposed (section 3.2) or include some of the unusual reactions (section 4), which will be discussed. However, it does provide a rational approach to describing many of the P450 reactions and serves as a basis for discussing more complex views of the chemistry. Only the major P450 reaction groups will be presented at this point.</p><p>3.2.1. Carbon Hydroxylation. Carbon hydroxylation (or C-oxidation) is a very common reaction.

A direct attack of a nonbonded electron pair on the oxygen atom of FeO 3+ seems unlikely in the context of the expected electron density, and a stepwise electron transfer is preferred, particularly in the context of the low E 1/2 values of these compounds. A oneelectron transfer/recombination mechanism can be written (Scheme 7). However, some theoretical calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(148)</ref> and the lack of a Hammett relationship (147) may be used in favor of a process in which a second electron transfer occurs prior to the rebound (Scheme 8).</p><p>Many N-oxides and S-oxides are less toxic than the parent molecules, but N-oxygenation of arylamines and heterocyclic amines is an important bioactivation step (149).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Heteroatom Release (Dealkylation).</head><p>This process results from the formal hydroxylation of a carbon adjacent to a heteroatom to yield an unstable compound that yields cleavage between that carbon and the heteroatom, e.g., a carbinolamine, acetal, thioacetal, gemhalohydrin, etc. The mechanism can be written as a "standard" carbon hydroxylation and probably does occur in this manner with fluorides, chlorides, and possibly bromides, as judged by the high kinetic hydrogen isotope effects etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(150,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">151)</ref>.

N-Oxygenation (2 × 1-Electron Transfer/Oxygen Rebound) (147, 148) Epoxidation is of particular interest in toxicology in that the products can be unstable and react with nucleophilic groups in macromolecules to initiate biological effects. Epoxidation is of considerable interest in organic synthesis, and the mechanism of chemical epoxidation has also been of considerable interest to chemists.</p><p>Early work in the P450 field generally treated the process of epoxidation as a rather concerted process, for both arenes and olefins. An often-described process is the "NIH Shift," with the name coming from the National Institutes of Health, where it was discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">(169)</ref>. The process, originally described with a 4,3-shift of the hydrogen, was encountered during an attempt to use release of the 4-3 H to H 2 O in an assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">(170,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">171)</ref>. The existence of this shift is often interpreted as evidence of an epoxide (in the formation of a phenol) (172) (Scheme 13). However, alternate mechanisms involving electrophilic FeO intermediates are also consistent with the observation of such migration (Scheme 14). Thus, the demonstration of the "NIH Shift" is in itself not conclusive evidence for the existence of an epoxide; better support comes from the isolation of a dihydrodiol or a hydroxy-GSH conjugate.</p><p>Several mechanisms are possible for the epoxidation of an olefin (with a metallo-oxo complex). The same applies to arenes, although this is a thermodynamically more difficult reaction. Mechanisms considered for epoxidation with biomimetic models, P450s, and other metalloprotein oxygenases include concerted processes and intermediates with a carbon radical, a carbocation, or metal-carbon bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">(173)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(174)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(175)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">(176)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(177)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(178)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">(179)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b179">(180)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(181)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">(182)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(183)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(184)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(185)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(186)</ref>. The lack of changes in stereochemistry is difficult to interpret in enzymes due to the potential constraints on rotation.</p><p>Biomimetic model studies have not given an unambiguous answer as to how epoxidation occurs in those systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">(183,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">184,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187)</ref>. Some of the work argues against a role of initial one-electron transfer in the epoxidation of olefins, at least with the models employed. In our own work, we did not find evidence for one-electron transfer in the epoxidation of low E 1/2 PAHs <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(188)</ref>. Much of the thinking regarding enzymatic epoxidation is dominated by the other reactions associated with many epoxidations, i.e., 1,2-shifts and heme modification (vide infra). A generalized paradigm is presented in Scheme 15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">(187)</ref>.</p><p>One phenomenon seen with only a few olefins and P450s is the incorporation of hydrogen from H 2 O into the epoxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(181)</ref>.

Such an entity is analogous to peroxidase compound I. However, such a P450 complex has not been characterized (other than possibly by UV-vis spectra obtained by adding oxygen surrogates), presumably due to its suspected instability. Much of the thinking regarding such a complex is the result of work with biomimetic models.</p><p>Early work in this field involved mobile reactive oxygen species (e.g., O 2 •-) (121) or an "oxene," which is a carbenelike proposition that was not well-described but was considered to be able to insert into CdC and C-H bonds <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(196)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(197)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">(198)</ref>. Some of the logic regarding these proposals was driven by models involving what is generally termed Fenton chemistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(199)</ref>. The concept of a high-valent FeO entity, akin to peroxidases, that could abstract hydrogen atoms and electrons and undergo oxygen rebounds developed in the late 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(123,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b199">200)</ref>. This paradigm provides reasonable explanations for scrambling of regioselectivity and stereoselectivity (Scheme 18) and for high intrinsic kinetic hydrogen isotope effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(122)</ref>.

As we have seen earlier, reasonable mechanisms can be drawn for most of the common P450 reactions. For instance, amine dealkylation and oxygenation can be rationalized easily with common intermediates (Scheme 19). Further, evidence for an oxygenating complex is provided by the reactions of P450s in the presence of the oxygen surrogate iodosylbenzene, which can only yield intermediates with a single oxygen <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(204,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">205)</ref>, i.e., the transfer of oxygen from iodosylbenzene to iodobenzene <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(206)</ref>.</p><p>One nagging problem with the FeO 3+ mechanism was that it did not provide an explanation for the last step in steroid deformylation, e.g. the aromatase reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(207)</ref>. Akhtar <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(208,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">209)</ref> and Robinson <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">(210)</ref> proposed an alternate mechanism involving a peroxyferryl intermediate (Scheme 20), and the work has been extended by Vaz and Coon to simple formyl models (Scheme 21) and the P450s involved in xenobiotic oxidations <ref type="bibr" target="#b210">(211)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(212)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b212">(213)</ref>. One of the strongest pieces of evidence for involvement of FeOO(H) is that these reactions can be supported by the oxygen surrogates H 2 O 2 and alkyl hydroperoxides but not a single-oxygen donor, iodosylbenzene <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(214)</ref>. Other evidence for the mechanism has accrued from studies with P450 mutants having a putative heme distal Thr changed to Ala. The logic has been that such mutants are impaired in their ability to cleave the O-O bond. Rates of some reactions are enhanced by these mutations, and the interpretation is consistent with a role of an FeOO(H) oxygenating species <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(214,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">215)</ref>. Oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid can also be rationalized with a peroxyferryl intermediate (Scheme <ref type="figure">22</ref>).</p><p>Experiments with strained cycloalkanes have been done with P450s since at least 1978 <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">(216)</ref>, and the rearrangements have been interpreted as evidence of radical intermediates <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b159">160)</ref> (Schemes 23 and 24). Refinements in the approach led to the "clocking" of the putative radicals, in the context of rates measured in solution. The results led to the view that the oxygen rebound is very fast, because some rearrangements are not very extensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">217)</ref>. Further studies with "faster" clocks led to even less rearrangement, and these results have been interpreted in terms of a concerted mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b217">(218)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b218">(219)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(220)</ref>. Newcomb has also interpreted results in the context of multiple intermediates, perhaps FeO 3+ and FeOO(H), which are involved in concerted and cationic-intermediate reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(221)</ref>. Interpretations of kinetic-hydrogen isotope effects and scrambling of regioselectivity results have also been proposed in the context of this paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(221,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">222)</ref>.</p><p>Another "alternative" proposal is the agostic model of Collman (Scheme 25) <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(223)</ref>. This is an alternative concerted mechanism developed to explain some results obtained with some porphyrin models <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(223)</ref>. This hypothesis has not been examined with P450 enzymes. Collman's group has also recently published evidence that product distribution in reactions catalyzed by metalloporphyrin models is influenced by the oxygen surrogate, arguing against a loss of occupancy by the surrogate in the oxygenating species <ref type="bibr" target="#b223">(224)</ref>, in line with a possible mechanism proposed earlier by Ortiz de Montellano <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>. This information may also be relevant to P450 systems and the discrepancies that are often seen between reactions supported by NADPH-reductase/O 2 and the surrogates (225-227). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">2</ref>Recently, Shaik and his associates have published an attempt to reconcile all of these results in the context of a more universal model <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">(228,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">229)</ref>. A "two-state reactivity" model is proposed in which the FeO 3+ complex is involved in all (or most reactions) but exists in two spin states, high and low. The low-spin complex is proposed to be involved in more concerted reactions, for some unknown reason, without barriers. The high-spin iron complex catalyzes similar chemistry but in stepwise, oddelectron processes. Only these latter reactions are proposed to show the scrambling and isotope effects.</p><p>The concept of the existence of multiple oxygenating species has some attraction. For instance, epoxidations might be explained with peroxide-type species, in that synthetic epoxidations can be done with H 2 O 2 and alkyl hydroperoxides, and there is precedent for enzymatic flavin C 4a -OOH epoxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(230)</ref>. Heteroatom oxygenations can also be done with peroxides <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(231,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b231">232)</ref>.</p><p>To date, much of the dogma of P450 catalytic selectivity has involved the view of a rather common chemistry and a reaction selectivity imposed by the juxtaposition of the substrate in the protein, with different atoms proferred to the iron-oxygen complex. We have tended to advance this view in our own past reviews on the subject <ref type="bibr">(131-133, 233, 234)</ref>, whether right or wrong. This has also been the general logic in all homology modeling and part of the rationale for obtaining crystal structures. However, an alternate view is that we are dealing with a group or a continuum of iron-oxygen species of varying activity (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Thus, we could have high-and low-spin FeO 3+ complexes capable of C-oxidation, an FeO 3+ (or even Scheme 21. Oxidative Deformylation of a Model Compound by P450 (211) Scheme 22. A Mechanism for Oxidation of an Aldehyde to a Carboxylic Acid by FeOO-Scheme 23. Oxidations of Cyclopropyl Derivatives by P450s</p><p>FeO 2+ ) complex capable of one-electron transfer, and FeOO -and FeOOH species, all with varying capabilities. In this view, catalytic selectivity would be influenced by the nature of the iron-oxygen complex, in the context of interactions with the axial ligand (Cys) and the substrate itself. As Ogliaro et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">(229)</ref> point out, iron-ligation and the strength of bonds formed after rebound (or its equivalent) greatly influence the theoretical predictions. In the high-spin complex, the R‚ intermediate is a better electron donor, the resulting C-O bond is stronger, and the Fe-S bond is weaker, according to theoretical calculations <ref type="bibr" target="#b228">(229)</ref>. Thus, the nature of the oxygenating species and also the juxtaposition of the substrate could be influenced by the protein structure. That is to say, the intrinsic iron-oxygen complex and the substrate juxtaposition are not independent variables. The view that a series of multiple iron-oxygen complexes exist and have different properties has a certain attraction and may explain some apparently conflicting results. However, it should be pointed out that there is no real experimental support for such a view, with the exception of the evidence for FeOO(H) intermediates already cited <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(214)</ref>. Moreover, any attempts to use modifications of protein structure are not unambiguous in that both substrate juxtaposition and properties of the iron-oxygen complex could be influenced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Rate-Limiting</head><p>Steps in P450 Reactions. Having now reviewed the general features of the chemistry of P450 catalysis and before embarking on a series of specific reactions, consideration of rate-limiting steps within the cycle is in order. Exactly which of the individual steps depicted in Scheme 1 (or 2) is rate limiting has been debated for many years. One of the prevalent views that has developed is that the reductions are rate limiting, either the input of the first or the second electron (Scheme 1). This view seems to have developed from some of the early work by Gillette <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">(235)</ref> and Ullrich <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">(236)</ref> with microsomes, in which the concentration of the reductase is low relative to P450, and the rates of reduction of some P450s [but not all <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103)</ref>] are facilitated by the presence of a substrate. However, this explanation is too simplistic, for a rather obvious reason. If reduction is rate limiting in all reactions with each P450, then all reactions should proceed at the same rate. Drug development in the pharmaceutical industry would be much easier because P450 3A4 reactions would all run at the same reaction rates with all potential drugs. However, this is obviously not the case.</p><p>In principle, any of the steps in Scheme 1 can limit rates of P450 reactions. We have been very interested in this subject in this laboratory, particularly with human P450s 1A2, 2D6, and 2E1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">(237)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b237">(238)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">(239)</ref>. If one examines the literature, examples of almost all the observable individual steps in Scheme 1 being rate limiting can be found, if one looks at enough P450s and enough reactions.</p><p>Substrate binding (step 1) is probably a rapid, diffusion-controlled reaction. Camphor binding to bacterial P450 101 has a measured k on of 2.5 × 10 7 M -1 s -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b239">240)</ref>, and efforts to measure substrate binding to mammalian P450s by observing rates of spin-state changes are consistent, if not as accurate <ref type="bibr" target="#b240">(241)</ref>. These rates are fast, of course, but at low substrate concentrations, the rate of binding substrate may either become rate limiting or, more likely, may be too low to compete with k off (k -1 ), which will determine the amount of substrate-bound P450. The possibility exists that the initial binding of substrate may not place it directly in an enzymesubstrate complex that can proceed on, and further "delivery" steps might be required [cf., prostaglandin synthase <ref type="bibr" target="#b241">(242)</ref>]. There is no experimental evidence to support the presence of additional, first-order steps, but their existence is possible. Even in P450s in which considerable protein movement is required to allow the substrate to bind inside the P450 [e.g., P450 101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b242">(243)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">(244)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b244">(245)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b245">(246)</ref>], rates of movement to a form in which the substrate can elicit iron spin state changes are fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>.</p><p>The reduction step involving the introduction of the first electron (step 2) is complex and has been studied extensively. Electron flow from NADPH through the two flavins of the reductase has been described in detail <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(104)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(105)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(106)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(107)</ref>. When P450 and reduced NADPH-P450 reductase are mixed together, the interaction to form a productive complex is rather slow, at least in artificial phospholipid residues that support P450 reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">247)</ref>. Moreover, if excess P450 is premixed with a limiting amount of reductase, then only an amount of P450 equivalent to the reductase is reduced rapidly and the remainder is reduced slowly <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103)</ref>. Such models may have relevance to microsomes, in which biphasic reduction of the P450 is usually observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">(248,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b248">249)</ref>.

With regard to the rate of interaction of the P450 and reductase proteins, it is not clear if their second-order rate of encounter is slow or there is a low (first-order) rearrangement following rapid second-order interaction.</p><p>In some systems, the presence of substrate can greatly facilitate rates of electron transfer from the reductase to a P450. The effect varies considerably among P450s and their substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103)</ref>. The effect may be considerable, e.g., addition of (S)-warfarin purified (reconstituted) to P450 2C9 increased the rate from ∼4 min -1 to 200 min -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103)</ref>. With P450 101, there is an excellent correlation between binding of the substrate camphor and shifts of the iron to the high-spin form and of the oxidationreduction midpoint potential (E m,7 ) to a more positive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b249">250)</ref>. Although some reviews and primary articles suggest that this relationship applies to all P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b250">251)</ref>, the evidence is limited and the exceptions outnumber the cases where a relationship exists in the literature with microsomal P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">119)</ref>. There is no evidence for major changes in E m,7 due to substrate binding to microsomal P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">252)</ref>, and nearly completely high-spin P450s have very low E m,7 values <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b252">253)</ref>. Reductions are driven by the high ratios of NADPH/NADP + in the combined Nernst equation, and proteins have ways of transmitting ligand binding into more efficient transfers without direct effects on the E m,7 of the iron.</p><p>The next step in the cycle (step 3) is O 2 binding. This step is probably fast and diffusion limited. With P450 101, the rate has been measured as 8 × 10 7 M -1 min -1 (K d ) 3 × 10 -8 M) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>. Nevertheless, several reduction reactions of P450s have been described (vide infra) and occur even in the presence of O 2 (at 180-200 µM in solutions, in vitro). It is possible that affinities of some P450 forms are poorer than others, but this possibility has not been explored.</p><p>The next step following O 2 binding is the introduction of the second electron into the system (step 4). This step is often discussed but its direct observation with a mammalian P450 has not been reported. With bacterial P450 101, this step has been observed by mixing the Fe 2+ ‚ O 2 complex with reduced putidaredoxin (k ) 2 × 10 7 M -1 s -1 ) (254). However, in the case of the mammalian P450s, the formation of a productive complex between the two proteins of interest is slow following mixing <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103)</ref>, and this experiment would not work. One of the reasons that step 4 is considered to be rate limiting (in some reactions) is the observed stimulation upon the addition of b 5 . This stimulation is usually attributed to the role of ferrous b 5 (which can rapidly accept electrons from NADPH-P450 reductase) in electron transfer. An explanation for the varying effects of b 5 in different P450 reactions has been offered by Pompon in terms of the reversibility of electron transfer between b 5 and the P450 Fe 2+ ‚O 2 complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(118)</ref>. A corollary to this work is that the E m,7 of the redox couple in step 4 is much more positive than that in step 2, because the E m,7 of b 5 is -20 mV <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">(255,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">256)</ref>. An E m,7 of ∼0 mV is predicted from the b 5 transfer and also from comparisons with the Fe 2+ ‚O 2 and Fe 2+ ‚CO complexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">119)</ref>. However, it should be pointed out that the stimulatory effect of b 5 may not be due only to electron transfer because at least four P450s have been shown to be stimulated by apo (heme-free) b 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b251">(252,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b256">257,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b257">258)</ref>.</p><p>Step 5 involves cleavage of the O-O bond to generate an FeO entity. This step has never been observed directly, and the rate has not been measured. Most of the information about this step has been deduced from the effects of changing Thr and Glu/Asp residues on product formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b258">(259)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b259">(260)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b260">(261)</ref>.

These latter results have been used in the deduction of a role for iron hydroperoxy complexes in oxygenation (Fe 2+ O 2 - or Fe 2+ OOH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">(214,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b263">264)</ref>.</p><p>The actual oxygenation reaction by a high valent FeO complex is usually described as either (i) sequential hydrogen atom abstraction/oxygen rebound <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">203)</ref>, (ii) sequential one-electron abstraction/deprotonation/oxygen rebound <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">152)</ref>, or (iii) a concerted oxygenation <ref type="bibr" target="#b222">(223,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b264">265)</ref>. High intramolecular kinetic hydrogen isotope effects have been used as an argument in favor of mechanism i, although mechanism ii may be difficult to distinguish because the isotope effects will depend on kinetic acidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(152,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b265">(266)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b266">(267)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b267">(268)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b268">(269)</ref>. Since none of these steps has been observed directly, rate constants are not available. However, the detection of a significant primary competitive hydrogen isotope effect in a noncompetitive (intermolecular) experiment provides evidence that the C-H bond-breaking step under consideration must be at least partially rate limiting. In the past, most efforts in this area had not shown high noncompetitive isotope effects, with some exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b269">(270,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b270">271)</ref>, and the conclusion was drawn that this step is not rate limiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b271">(272)</ref>. Recently, we have found a number of examples of intermolecular kinetic hydrogen isotope effects (in the range of 2-14) (136, 237, 239). 2 These results argue that this step (C-H bond breaking) is at least partially ratelimiting. Studies with radical clocks (strained cycloalkanes) have been used as evidence for rapid oxygen rebound. This conclusion has been generally accepted in the field. There are caveats, however, in that the apparently very rapid rates may reflect either a change to a concerted mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b218">(219,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b222">223)</ref> or retardation of rearrangement by the protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b272">(273)</ref>.</p><p>Relatively little attention had been given to the possibly rate-limiting nature of any steps following product formation.

In our own work on the mechanism of the increased P450 2E1, K m values seen upon deuteration of ethanol (and subsequently acetaldehyde as well), the burst kinetics could only be interpreted in the context of a rate-limiting step (for the steady-state reaction) that must follow product formation (136, 239) (Scheme 26).

The steady-state rate constants for the various reactions (Odealkylation and acetol formation) by different mutants vary considerably <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">(237,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">275)</ref>. A slightly simplified kinetic mechanism was used (Scheme 28). Limits on the system include the known rate of reduction of the ferric enzyme, the kinetic deuterium isotope effects, and the rates of formation of H 2 O 2 (measured) and H 2 O (calculated by balance between NADPH oxidation and the formation of products and H 2 O 2 ). Substrate and product affinity can be predicted (in the ground state) by spectral titration, although there are caveats about the relationship of the mode of binding to that needed for catalysis.</p><p>v vs S plots could be fit well by using the mechanism and set of rate constants shown in Scheme 28 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Many different reactions could be fit well by varying only k 6 , the rate of substrate oxygenation. Varying this constant yielded excellent fits of protiated and deuterated substrates with wild-type P450 1A2 and mutant E225I, which has enhanced activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">(237,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">239,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b274">275)</ref>.</p><p>The sensitivity of the fits to changes in several of the rate constants is shown (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Changes in k 4 , k 5 , or k 6 influenced the fit. Adjustments to k 8 or k 9 yielded estimates of H 2 O 2 and H 2 O that were not only incompatible with those observed; these changes also changed both the k cat and K m for the O-dealkylation reaction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The overall set of rate constants is not considered a unique solution and the individual rate estimates must not be considered to be defined values. Nevertheless, these rules do satisfy a number of criteria and should be regarded as approximations. It is important to emphasize that the mechanism is probably more complex than depicted in Schemes 1, 2, and 28. The classic and accepted approach to kinetic modeling is to begin with a "minimal" mechanism and use it until discrepancies must be rationalized, which has been done here.</p><p>If the rate constants used in Scheme 28 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are valid, they provide an interesting picture of P450 kinetics. With k 4 ) 350-700 min -1 , k 5 ) 110 min -1 , k 6 ) 33 min -1 , and k 8 ) k 9 ) 50 min -1 , we have an enzyme reaction with several transition states of similar heights (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The reaction diagram is constructed for the reaction described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and utilizing several assumptions. The energy differences are set up using ∆G ) -RT ln K for binding equilibria, ∆G ) -nFE (m,7) for oxidation-reduction changes, and k obs ) (kT/h)e -∆G*/RT for transition state barriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b275">(276,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b276">277)</ref>. (The position of the FeO 3+ /substrate complex cannot be estimated by this approach; E m,7 for the second electron reduction is set at 0 mV, vide supra.) The similarity of the heights of several transition states, if this view is indeed valid, provides a system in which minor changes in the interaction of a P450 with its ligands and accessory factors (e.g., reductase) can alter catalytic specificity.</p><p>If this system is applicable to other P450s and substrates, small changes in any of several rate constants can be manifested in altered steady-state rates. It is also notable that, because of the situation, the observed k cat is considerably less than any of the microscopic rate constants. The K m can be altered by changing k -1 or k 7 or by changing k 8 or k 9 <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">(239)</ref>. We have not extensively explored which other rate constants can be altered to change K m (other than k -1 , k 7 , k 8 , and k 9 ). Another conclusion from this work is that (mammalian) P450s with very high steady-state rates must have higher rate constants for several steps, not only one.</p></div>

All rates are in min -1 (first-order) or min -1 µM -1 (second-order). microsomal P450s have been very accommodating, because of their very nature, and usually accept a great variety of homologues and various diagnostic probes. Because of this promiscuity, we can do many experiments with many of the P450s and subject them to studies involving structure-activity relationships, linear free energy relationships, and searches for rearrangements diagnostic of particular mechanisms.</p><p>In one sense, the study of "unusual" reactions provides a window for what might be considered the "mainstream" reactions of the enzyme. For instance, the view that epoxidation is a stepwise and not a concerted process is based in a large part on the demonstration of 1,2-shifts and formation of modified porphyrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b186">187,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">194)</ref>, events that are not be readily accommodated with concerted mechanisms. However, another side of the picture is that the unusual reaction mechanisms may be simply that, i.e., they may have been selected with the particular probes and not applicable to general reactions catalyzed by the enzyme. These caveats apply to P450 reactions. However, any general mechanisms must somehow accommodate the unusual reactions of an enzyme. In the best of mechanisms, these can be rationalized in terms of particular properties of the probes. Another axiom of mechanistic enzymology is that a positive result has far more impact than a negative one; the possible explanations of how protein structures can attenuate chemistry is myriad.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.1.</head><p>Reductions. Although P450s do not participate in biological reductions of endogenous substrates to the extent that flavoproteins do, the diversity of reduction reactions catalyzed by P450s is still considerable. The scope of reduction reactions is somewhat surprising in light of the reactivity of ferrous P450 with O 2 (vide supra). Indeed, anyone who has tried to work with P450s in the Fe 2+ form might wonder why P450 would not be oxidized under minimally aerobic conditions. The general consensus has been that all ferrous P450s bind O 2 tightly and that reoxidation reactions are rapid. However, one consideration is that some of the reactions of interest would be more favorable in veinous sections of tissues, where the O 2 tension is reduced in the gradients. The E m,7 for most microsomal P450s appears to be ∼-300 mV, in the absence or presence of substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">252)</ref>. Thus, ferrous P450 should be a reasonably good one-electron reducing agent, if a substrate can bind and receive electrons. It is possible that some substrates may bind in such a way as to inhibit O 2 binding; this possibility has not been explored very thoroughly. For instance, "Type II" liganding to iron might be effective in this way. Another consideration is that the Fe 2+ O 2 complex, while it is waiting for an electron, is still a reducing agent. As mentioned earlier, it probably has an E m,7 near 0 mV [based on the b 5 work <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(118,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b254">255,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">256)</ref>]. Thus the transfer of an electron to a substrate may be competitive with oxidation even in the presence of O 2 . Lists of substrates for reduction by P450s have been compiled by Wislocki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b277">(278)</ref> and more recently by Testa <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In most cases, more mechanistic information about the reactions is not available, and the reader is referred to these reviews and primary references for more details. Some of the reduction reactions are presented in Schemes 29-37 and will be discussed briefly.</p><p>Alkyl halides are reduced, with CCl 4 and halothane serving as classic examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b282">(283,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b283">284)</ref>. Among the products are reduced haloalkanes (halide replaced by hydrogen) and olefins (dehydrohalogenation products), along with products generated from the reaction of generated radicals with oxygen, cellular macromolecules, and even other radicals (Scheme 31). Although the reductive defluorination of halothane has been studied extensively, the oxidation is probably more relevant to toxicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b284">(285)</ref>. Some examples of reductive dehalogenation of aryl halides have also been reported. Halide ions are produced in these reductions. A viable mechanism proposed by Castro ( <ref type="formula">279</ref>) is shown in Scheme 33.</p><p>The reaction of alkyl hydroperoxides with ferric P450 has already been mentioned under the general considerations of chemical mechanisms; in this sense the hydroperoxides serve as "oxygen surrogates" (see also section 4.11 for rearrangements of lipoxygenase-catalyzed hydroperoxide products of fatty acids). Hydroperoxides undergo other reactions with ferrous P450, particularly the formation of carbonyls and CH 4 (Scheme 34) <ref type="bibr" target="#b279">(280)</ref>.

The deoxygenation/ demethylation of N-alkylarylamine N-oxides by ferrous P450 has been rationalized in a mechanism involving Polonowski chemistry (Scheme 30) <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(147)</ref>. A rather unusual P450 reaction is the reduction of the drug nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate), which yields nitric oxide <ref type="bibr" target="#b285">(286)</ref>. Another unexpected reduction is that of benzamidoximine, reported by Clement et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b286">(287)</ref>. The reduction involves the pathway NADH f NADH-b 5 reductase f b 5 f 2D family P450 f benzamidoxime, which seems highly unexpected in light of (i) the unfavorable potential for transfer of electrons from b 5 [E m,7 ≈ 0 mV <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">(255,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b255">256)</ref>] to a P450 [E m,7 ≈ -300 mV <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(119,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b287">288)</ref>] and (ii) the low activities of NADH/b 5 systems in supporting P450 reactions that normally proceed via electron transfer from NADPH-P450 reductase <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(120,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b288">289)</ref>. One-electron reduction of a nitro compound yields a nitroanion radical which, as in the case of halides (Scheme 32), may react with O 2 to initiate an abortive and destructive redox process.</p><p>P450s also reduce nitrogen-nitrogen compounds such as azo compounds, triazines, and hydrazines (Scheme 35) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b277">278)</ref>.

P450 reduces SO 2 (or its hydrated form bisulfite, HSO 3 -) to SO 2 •-(which is in equilibrium with dithionite, S 2 O 4 2-) (291). SO 2 •-can then reduce P450 <ref type="bibr" target="#b291">(292)</ref>, and the reaction is reversible (the E m,7 for SO 2 •-is much less than that of P450, so the process will in principle be subject to equilibrium thermodynamic considerations). P450s (particularly 2E1) reduce Cr VI (to Cr V , Cr IV , Cr III ), a process that may contribute to the bioactivation of this carcinogenic metal <ref type="bibr" target="#b292">(293)</ref>. The bacterial P450 nor (P450 55) reduces NO‚ at a very rapid rate (second-order rate constant of 2.5 × 10 7 M -1 s -1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b293">(294,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b294">295)</ref>. This unusual P450 binds NADH directly and then apparently reduces the Fe-NO complex in a two-electron process <ref type="bibr" target="#b295">(296)</ref>. 4.2. Desaturation. Desaturation, or dehydrogenation, is an important part of fatty acid metabolism and some other aspects of intermediary metabolism, usually involving flavoproteins or non-heme iron proteins. The reaction is electronically equivalent to hydroxylation in that it involves a net two-electron oxidation, with or without H 2 O to balance the stoichiometry.</p><p>Although desaturation was a well-established process for the so-called fatty acid desaturases, which were known to be mixed-function oxidases, the roles of P450s in desaturation were not clearly recognized in earlier work. In some cases in which olefins were characterized as products, the general feeling seemed to be that these were artifacts of the dehydration of initial alcohol products. For instance, ∆ 9 -dehydrowarfarin was recognized as a P450 oxidation product of warfarin <ref type="bibr" target="#b296">(297,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b297">298)</ref>. The Millers found that vinyl carbamate was more carcinogenic than urethan (and formed more DNA adducts) and postulated that dehydrogenation occurred but were unable to detect formation of the olefin <ref type="bibr" target="#b298">(299)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b299">(300)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b300">(301)</ref>.</p><p>A seminal advance was the characterization by Baillie and Rettie of the desaturation and hydroxylation of the anti-epileptic drug valproic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">(302)</ref>. They clearly demonstrated that both the alcohol and the olefin were stable products and did not interconvert. A purified P450 Scheme 36. Reduction of Gentian Violet (12, 281) Scheme 37. Reduction of Zonisamide (12, 282)</p><p>catalyzed both reactions, ruling out contributions from any microsomal fatty acid desaturases. Similar studies have now been done on a variety of other substrates and a list (not necessarily comprehensive) is presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>The mechanism of alkane desaturation is postulated to begin as in the case of C-hydroxylation, with abstraction of a hydrogen atom (Scheme 38). There is a competition between oxygen rebound and abstract of what is formally a second hydrogen atom (or an electron plus a proton). In all known examples of P450-catalyzed desaturation, C-hydroxylation is also observed and is usually the major course of the reaction (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). Support for this mechanism comes from studies with deuterated valproic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">(307,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b307">308)</ref>. Valproic acid is a symmetrical molecule, and the intramolecular kinetic isotope effect experiments were done with perdeuteration at either the 4-or 5-position on one arm of the molecule (Scheme 39). Apparent kinetic isotope effects [ D (V/K)] of 4-5 were seen for the two hydroxylated products. An isotope effect of 5.6 was seen with 4,5-2 H substrate, consistent with the view that abstraction of a hydrogen atom at C-4 initiates both 4-hydroxylation and desaturation. Removal of the elements of a hydrogen atom from C-5 is not rate limiting. The results do not rule out the possibility that desaturation could be initiated at C-5, with that H abstraction proceeding more rapidly than the second at C-4, although this process would have to be rather independent of C-5 hydroxylation, which shows a large isotope effect. Another interesting aspect of the work is the large intermolecular noncompetitive isotope effect (6.6) seen in comparing rates of desaturation of [4,4,4′,4′-2 H 4 ]-with protiated valproic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">(307)</ref>. In our own work on the oxidation of ethyl carbamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">(306)</ref>, we found intermolecular noncompetitive isotope effects of 6-8 for the transformation of [ 2 H 5 -ethyl] ethyl carbamate to 2-hydroxyethyl carbamate, vinyl carbamate, and the 1, N 6 --adenosine formed by trapping the epoxide (Scheme 40). In the deuterium isotope studies with both valproic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">(307,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b307">308)</ref> and ethyl carbamate <ref type="bibr" target="#b305">(306)</ref>, the apparent noncompetitive isotope effects are large but are not segregated into k cat and K m components, so the parameters may or may not indicate that k cat is limited by the rate of C-H bond breaking [i.e., an isotope effect on K m could be indicative of an isotopically sensitive step that is not rate limiting in the steady-state reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">(136,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b275">276)</ref>].</p><p>A related reaction is the dehydrogenation of N-methylformamide to methyl isocyanate (Scheme 41), catalyzed by P450 2E1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b308">(309,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b309">310)</ref>. The mechanistic similarity to alkane desaturation is unclear. This reaction is a bioactivation step in that it converts N-methylformamide (an N-demethylation product of the common solvent N,Ndimethylformamide) to a very reactive electrophile, methyl isocyanate, which was involved in a serious industrial accident in Bopal, India, in 1984 in which 3500 people died.</p><p>Another situation in which the apparent bifurcation between hydroxylation and desaturation may be applicable is in the oxidation of N-nitrosamines (Scheme 42). The oxidative N-alkylation and subsequent generation of an alkylating species has been known for some time <ref type="bibr" target="#b310">(311)</ref>. A reasonable proposal involves initial hydrogen atom abstraction followed by oxygen rebound to generate the R-hydroxynitrosamine, which rearranges to yield an aldehyde plus an alkyldiazohydroxide. A mechanism involving initial one-electron abstraction from the nitrogen is conceivable but probably unlikely in light of the lack of electron density on the atom <ref type="bibr" target="#b311">(312)</ref> and the relatively high intrinsic kinetic deuterium isotope effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">(313)</ref>. The latter species is unstable and yields N 2 , OH -, and what would formally be a carbonium ion (Scheme 42). For many years, the production of nitrite and alkylamines has also been known <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">(314,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b314">315)</ref>. One postulate for this reaction was the interaction of the nitrosamine with ferrous P450 <ref type="bibr" target="#b313">(314,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b315">316)</ref>. However, the reaction has been shown to yield nitric oxide, representing an odd-electron removal from the substrate. Further, the same kinetic hydrogen isotope effect [ D (V/K) ≈ 5] is seen for the denitrosation reaction as for the N-demethylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b312">(313)</ref>. [An anomaly in these assays is that the denitrosation pathway shown would also generate HCHO (Scheme 42).] Nitric oxide forms nitrite through oxidation or dismutation <ref type="bibr" target="#b316">(317)</ref>; it can also elicit numerous effects by activating guanylate cyclase or after reacting with O 2 •- to yield peroxynitrite.</p><p>The proposed mechanism (Scheme 42) is actually another case of a collapse of a putative alkyl radical to yield a desaturated product along with the alcohol. However, more direct evidence for this denitrosation mechanism is still required.</p><p>The mechanistic information available does not provide a ready answer as to why some C-hydroxylations are accompanied by desaturation and others are not (Scheme 39). At this time, the desaturation reaction is not very predictable, unfortunately, because it can often favor subsequent activation reactions to yield toxic products, as in the case of valproic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">(302)</ref> and ethyl carbamate</p><p>Table 2.

One can consider the mechanistic literature of the fatty acid desaturases, which apparently desaturate without releasing any hydroxylated products. These enzymes use di-iron µ-oxo species (318). However, di-iron µ-oxo systems also function in monooxygenase enzymes (e.g., methane monooxygenase) and the distinction between oxygen transfer and desaturation in these enzymes is also attributed to uncharacterized effects of groups in the proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b317">(318)</ref>. Some other P450 "desaturation" reactions have similarity but are mechanistically different thatn the major systems discussed here. Studies on the oxidation of 1,4-dihydropyridines by Ortiz de Montellano <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(125,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126)</ref> and subsequently our own laboratory (130, 161) identified desaturation as a major event in the metabolism, probably driven by pyridine ring stability. This process is an unusual vinylogous sort of desaturation driven by the ease of one-electron oxidation and more homologous to N-dealkylation (section 3.2.2) rather than C-C desaturation (Scheme 11). Another related reaction is the net two-electron oxidation of acetaminophen to the reactive quinoneimine (Scheme 43) (319).</p></div>

Aldehyde Scissions. As pointed out in section 3.1, the reduction of hydroperoxides by P450s can generate ketones or aldehydes. Aldehydes (and ketones, to a lesser extent) have long been considered to be potentially deleterious chemicals because of their potential to form Schiff bases with proteins and exocyclic atoms of nucleic acids. However, more recently these have also been shown to undergo oxidative activation to species that cause inactivation of P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b338">(339)</ref>. Aldehydes also undergo P450 oxidations, not only to acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(340)</ref>, but also some that appear to reflect a different type of chemistry. One impetus to the study of aldehyde oxidation was the longstanding difficulty in rationalizing the final step in the aromatization of androgens to estrogens. Gradual support has developed for a mechanism proposed by Aktar <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(208,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">209)</ref> and Robinson ( <ref type="formula">210</ref> Scheme 49.

It is possible to rationalize P450-catalyzed oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid with either FeO 3+ or FeOOH, as we have done with the P450 2E1-catalyzed oxidation of acetaldehyde (136) (Schemes 5 and 52). 4.7. Dehydration. One example of a formal P450catalyzed dehydration is the transformation of lipoxygenase-generated fatty acid hydroperoxides to allene oxides. This reaction begins with a reactive substrate and almost certainly involves internal electron transfer between the iron and oxygen atoms during the reaction, and this case will be treated separately under section 4.11, along with prostaglandin H 2 rearrangements.</p><p>P450s dehydrate aldoximes to yield nitriles, as shown by Mansuy and his associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">(341,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b341">342)</ref>. This is a key step in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin in (the plant) Sorghum bicolor <ref type="bibr" target="#b342">(343)</ref>. A particular P450 appears to catalyze both the dehydration of an aldoxime to the nitrile and also the subsequent (C-) hydroxylation of the nitrile (at the carbon R to the nitrile). Mammalian microsomal enzymes can also catalyze these reactions with model aldoximes, e.g., P450 3A4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b340">(341)</ref>. Nitriles can be toxic <ref type="bibr" target="#b343">(344)</ref>; aldoximines are relatively rare chemicals in biological systems, although NADPH-dependent dehydration of a metabolite of the pesticide aldicarb to an aldoxime has been observed with fish microsomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b344">(345)</ref>.</p><p>Biomimetic studies have shown that such dehydrations can be achieved with nonprotein iron porphyrin systems, if the iron is in the ferrous form and a proton donor is accessible <ref type="bibr" target="#b339">(340)</ref>.

Other examples of this process directly relevant to toxicology are unknown (other than consideration of the cyanogenic glucosides found in plants).</p><p>4.8.

A mechanism to rationalize this is the stepwise one shown in Scheme 54, where the oxygen rebound occurs at the carbon bearing the ethoxy group.

As in many cases of oxidations of aromatic compounds, epoxidations are possible and may not be distinguished from other potential intermediates without additional evidence.</p><p>Rietjens and Hirobe and their colleagues have presented an ipso mechanism to explain the replacement of aryl halides by hydroxyls (Scheme 56) <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">(350)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b350">(351)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b351">(352)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b352">(353)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b353">(354)</ref>. Fluoride ion is released in the conversion of pentafluorophenol to 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorohydroquinone. Epoxide intermediates cannot be ruled out, but no NIH shifts have been detected <ref type="bibr" target="#b354">(355)</ref>. The loss of fluoride seems reasonable in that fluoride is the best leaving group in aromatic substitution reactions (in contrast to alkyl systems). An alternate pathway to explain the products is oxygenation on the halogen (haloso product) followed by loss of halite (XO -) X + ) (356), which has not been detected in trapping experiments. Halogen oxygenation can be demonstrated with iodobenzenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(143,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">206)</ref>; with aryl bromides the situation is less clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b142">(143)</ref>. Thus, chlorine and fluorine would be even less likely to be oxygenated because of their electronic properties (E 1/2 and electronegativity), as pointed out by Rietjens and Vervoort <ref type="bibr" target="#b349">(350)</ref>. One remaining problem with the mechanism (Scheme 56) is that it requires a two-electron reduction to yield the hydroquinone. Nonenzymatic reduction of a quinone or quinoneimine by NADPH or GSH can be efficient (319) (Scheme 43).</p><p>A possibly related reaction in which an aromatic ring is converted to a quinone-like structure is the oxidation of the estrogen A rings shown in Scheme 57 <ref type="bibr" target="#b356">(357)</ref>. In the absence of 18 O labeling data, this reaction can be explained readily by the mechanism shown in Scheme 58A. However, an ipso mechanism (Scheme 58B) could be involved to explain incorporation of oxygen from H 2 O in the added hydroxyl.</p><p>4.9. One-Electron Oxidation. Stepwise electron transfer in the oxidation of substrates by P450s is not a new concept. There is general agreement that this is the dominant mechanism that peroxidases use to catalyze the oxidation of amines, alcohols, and anything else accessible to the E 1/2 values of 1.06 and 1.08 V estimated for the redox reactions of compounds I and II <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(124)</ref>. Earlier comparisons of the catalytic mechanism of P450s to peroxidases led to development of the proposal of oneelectron transfer by this laboratory, in collaboration with Macdonald <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">131)</ref>, and by Ortiz de Montellano <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125)</ref>.</p><p>The development of the case for the involvement of oneelectron transfer in the N-dealkylation of amines is presented elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">133,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">156,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b157">158)</ref> and will not be Scheme 55.

The same principles apply to S-dealkylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b357">(358,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b358">359)</ref>. P450s are capable of both one-electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer when they oxidize substrates; the mechanism is probably dependent upon the geometry (and the use of FeO 3+ instead of peroxy forms). In this section, several other issues related to P450catalyzed one-electron oxidations are considered.</p><p>If the premise of one-electron oxidation by P450s is accepted, on the basis of the experimental evidence, then one issue is how strong an oxidant is P450 (i.e., FeO 3+ ; the FeOO -/FeOOH forms would probably be weaker oxidants). No exact value can be measured, but there is precedent in measurements of the analogous electronic states of peroxidases and biomimetric models. For horseradish peroxidase, E 1/2 estimates for both the complex compound I T compound II and compound II T ferric are ∼1.0 V <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(124)</ref>. The reported potentials for the analogous metalloporphyrin models are in the range of 1.0-1.8 V <ref type="bibr" target="#b359">(360)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b360">(361)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b361">(362)</ref>. They are strongly influenced by the solvent and ligands, as well as the metal (Cr, Mn, Fe). We would expect the potentials of P450 FeO 3+ complexes to fall in this range. In some work on the application of Marcus theory to P450 2B1-catalyzed N-dealkylation reactions with p-substituted N,N-dimethylanilines we were able to fit our results to a model with an E 1/2 of ∼1.8 V (164). This model includes a number of assumptions and, even if these are valid, there is considerable room for error in this value. One point included in the discussion of that work <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(164)</ref> is that the effective E 1/2 is a function of the distance (r) between the site of oxidation on the substrate and the FeO 3+ complex (outer-sphere model) and also effective dielectric constant (D). The E 1/2 increases with decreases in r and D. Thus E 1/2 may vary among P450s and among the reactions catalyzed by a particular P450, overcoming arguments such as those of <ref type="bibr">Eberson (363)</ref> against the ability of P450s to transfer electrons, which is inherently feasible in light of the known abilities of peroxidases to abstract electrons even from PAHs <ref type="bibr" target="#b363">(364,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b364">365)</ref>. One-electron oxidation can probably be considered a possibility whenever substrates with E 1/2 of &lt;1.0-1.5 V are considered. The list of substrates for which evidence for one-electron oxidation exists includes amines, sulfides, strained alkanes, anisoles, and polycyclic hydrocarbons. A case can probably be made for some other compounds as well.</p><p>Ortiz de Montellano and Stearns examined some strained cycloalkanes, which are known to have low E 1/2 values <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(160,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b365">366)</ref>. Of particular note was quadricyclane, E 1/2 ) 0.9 V (159). The P450-catalyzed oxidation was accompanied by a rearrangement that could be only rationally explained by a one-electron oxidation (159, 160) (Scheme 24). These studies with strained cycloalkanes complement the work done with amines, which have similar E 1/2 values <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">128)</ref>.</p><p>One group of chemicals long considered as substrates for one-electron oxidation is the PAHs. PAHs are major components of tobacco smoke, soots, tars, and pyrolyzed food and many induce tumors in experimental animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b366">(367)</ref>. The most generally accepted mechanism for activation of PAHs involves the formation of diol-epoxides, particularly in the so-called bay and fjord regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b367">(368,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b368">369)</ref>. Some alternate possibilities for activation of PAHs include (i) hydroxylation (particularly at alkyl side chains) and attachment of leaving groups such as sulfate <ref type="bibr" target="#b369">(370,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b370">371)</ref>, (ii) formation of quinones by sequential oxidations <ref type="bibr" target="#b371">(372)</ref>, and (iii) one-electron oxidation to radical cations (Scheme 59). Pathway i can be demonstrated in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b373">(374,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b374">375)</ref> but the in vivo evidence for its significance is limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b370">(371)</ref>. Pathway ii may follow iii; the quinones are probably not bound well to DNA but may be involved in the formation of reactive, partially reduced oxygen species through futile redox cycling. Mechanism iii, one-electron oxidation, has been considered not only in the context of generating reactive cation radicals but as a part of the generation of quinones and even epoxides.</p><p>A case for reactive PAH cation radicals (Scheme 59) is not new and goes back to work in the 1960s by Fried, Ts'O, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b375">(376)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b376">(377)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b377">(378)</ref>. Oxidations of PAHs by model oxidants were described <ref type="bibr" target="#b378">(379)</ref>.

Cavalieri and Rogan have continued to study the issues of PAH cation radicals and their biological relevance <ref type="bibr" target="#b372">(373,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b381">382)</ref>. The incubation of PAHs with peroxidases (and H 2 O 2 ) in the presence of DNA yields adducts characterized to be the same as those also generated by electrochemical oxidations (373, 382) (Scheme 60). Some of these are found in vivo, although alternate pathways (than formation of cation radicals) to these adducts (e.g., guanyl-N 7 -PAH adducts) cannot be unambiguously ruled Scheme 60. DNA-PAH Adducts Attributed to P450 1-Electron Transfer Products (384)</p><p>out. Another issue is the instability of PAH radical cations (t 1/2 in the millisecond range) <ref type="bibr" target="#b384">(385)</ref>. If these were generated by P450s in the endoplasmic reticulum, could they really move to the nucleus? [Perhaps a reference point in this regard is aflatoxin B 1 exo-8,9-epoxide, which has a t 1/2 of 1 s in H 2 O yet modifies DNA extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref>.]</p><p>We have explored the basic question of whether P450s can oxidize PAHs (Scheme 61). The simplified models are 9-alkylanthracenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b385">(386,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b386">387)</ref>. A series of studies were done with P450 2B1, horseradish peroxidase/H 2 O 2 , and a biomimetic model and the major experiments involved the incorporation of 18 O from H 2 O into the products <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(188)</ref>. Even with these simple models, the products were complex. One conclusion is that formation of cation radicals does not seem to be an obligatory step on the pathway to epoxides or phenols. Reasonable schemes could be developed for the observed products, even those involving demethylation of 9-methylanthracene. However, unambiguous distinction between one-electron transfer and "direct" hydroxylation (e.g., via hydrogen atom abstraction) was not possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">(188)</ref>. One problem was the potential for H 2 O generated within the P450 active site to react with cations before exchanging with the medium.</p><p>To resolve the issue of whether P450s could oxidize low E 1/2 aromatic compounds by one-electron transfer, we turned our attention to "polyanisoles" (polymethoxybenzenes), which had been used extensively in the peroxidase literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b387">(388,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b388">389)</ref>. Formation of cation radicals of these compounds is easily demonstrated with peroxidases because (i) the radicals are rather stable at the low pH values used with many peroxidases, (ii) the radicals can be detected by their visible or ESR spectra, and (iii) peroxidases form few other products from these compounds. We demonstrated that several P450s could oxidize 1,2,4,5-tetramethyoxybenzene (Scheme 62, E 1/2 0.83 V) to a cation radical (λ max 450 nm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b389">(390)</ref>. The cation radical is hydrolyzed to o-and p-quinones in both peroxidase-and P450-catalyzed reactions (Scheme 63) <ref type="bibr" target="#b389">(390)</ref>. These experiments establish that P450s are capable of catalyzing one-electron oxidation of low E 1/2 compounds, and most PAHs have similar potentials <ref type="bibr" target="#b390">(391)</ref>. However, the stability of these radicals at neutral pH and their roles in carcinogenesis remain to be established.</p><p>The generality of one-electron oxidation in the oxidation of anisoles and related phenylalkyl ethers remains to be better established. We had tended to consider the E 1/2 values of such compounds to be outside the range for efficient one-electron oxidation. However, in recent work we found that low E 1/2 values had been established for phenacetin (N-acetylphenetidine) <ref type="bibr" target="#b391">(392,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b392">393)</ref> and could repeat these results. The low E 1/2 is of interest in the consideration of low kinetic hydrogen isotope effects for the O-dealkylation of phenacetin but high isotope effects for acetol hydroxylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b236">(237,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b238">239)</ref>, even though both reactions are formally C-hydroxylations. These results have been extended to more p-alkoxyacylanilides <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">(239)</ref>. Horseradish peroxidase can catalyze O-dealkylations of these substrates (but not acetol formation), although the rates are low. 2 Further studies on the role of one-electron transfer in these reactions are in progress.</p><p>4.10. Coupling Reactions. This section describes oxidative couplings, either intra-or intermolecular, catalyzed by mammalian P450 enzymes. These are distinguished from what is termed a "ring formation" in section 3.5, where a stable product rearranges to yield a new ring system (e.g., pulegone). These are fairly rare reactions and only two examples are provided.</p><p>One reaction is the intramolecular ring formation involved in the synthesis of morphine <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b393">394)</ref>. Mammals synthesize low concentrations of morphine alkaloids, apparently starting from dopamine. Examination of the pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b394">395)</ref> indicates the presence of several oxidation steps, the putative P450s for which have not been identified yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b395">(396)</ref>. P450s (microsomes) catalyze cyclization of (R)-reticuline to salutaridine (Scheme 64) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b396">397)</ref>.</p><p>Another possible example is a structure identified as 6H-oxazolo[3,2-a:4,5-b′]diindole (Scheme 65), derived from the oxidation of indole by several P450s <ref type="bibr" target="#b397">(398)</ref>. A mechanism has been proposed for the coupling (Scheme 66). The dye indigo is formed by the nonenzymatic oxidation and coupling of two indoxyls (3-hydroxyindole); in a Scheme 63. Products of 1,2,4,5-Tetramethoxybenzene Oxidation Catalyzed by Rabbit P450 1A2 a a Products labeled with the letters a, b, c, and d were identified (390).</p><p>similar manner indirubin is formed from the coupling of indoxyl and isatin <ref type="bibr" target="#b397">(398)</ref>. It is possible that P450s can facilitate these couplings, although the nonenzymatic efficiency is high. However, indoxyl (and indigo) did not form 6H-oxazolo[3,2-a:4,5-b′]diindole nonenzymatically, so some P450s appear to have binding sites large enough to bind two indole rings and facilitate couplings.</p><p>Wakabayashi and his associates have reported the coupling of norharman and aniline in an NADPHdependent reaction (Scheme 67) (399). This reaction, which is tentatively attributed to P450, generates a compound that can be further oxidized to a mutagenic hydroxylamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b398">(399)</ref>. Neither norharman nor aniline is mutagenic itself following incubation with microsomes and NADPH. The coupling process is a formal twoelectron oxidation. It is difficult to propose a reaction product of either norharman or aniline that is stable enough to migrate from a P450 and be reactive enough to couple with aniline, or vice versa. An alternative proposal is presented in Scheme 68, in which the two amines are present together in a P450 and the reaction begins with an ipso attack on the aniline (see section 4.8). Alternatively, radical mechanisms are possible. Thromboxane and prostacyclin synthases are P450s 5 and 8, respectively (400-402) (Scheme 69). These P450s have specialized functions and are localized primarily in platelets (P450 5) and endothelial cells (aorta) (P450 8). Current knowledge does not indicate any other natural substrates for these P450s other than prostaglandin H 2 , an unstable hydroperoxide that would probably have to be made in the same cell to be a substrate. However, Ullrich and his associates <ref type="bibr" target="#b402">(403)</ref> have shown that the enzyme can catalyze monooxygenation reactions on a prostaglandin H 2 analogue in a reaction supported by the oxygen surrogate iodosylbenzene.</p><p>Thromboxane synthase (P450 5) converts prostaglandin H 2 to a ∼1:1:1 mixture of thromboxane A 2 , hydroxyheptatrienoic acid (HHT), and malondialdehyde <ref type="bibr" target="#b401">(402)</ref>. P450s 1A2 and 3A4 have appreciable catalytic activity in converting prostaglandin H 2 to HHT and malondialdehyde (∼10 min -1 ), although there is considerable species variation in the P450 1A2 rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b403">(404)</ref>. The chemical mechanism of the rearrangement to form HHT and malondialdehyde by these P450s is presumed to be similar to that postulated for the thromboxane synthase (Scheme 69). These findings may be of relevance in tissues or tumor cells that express both cycloxygenase (which generates prostaglandin H 2 ) and P450s that a The indicated carbon atoms (•) in reticuline are linked to form salutaridine. Desaturation yields allene oxides, major products with plant P450 74A. Allene oxides are highly unstable and undergo rapid rearrangement to other products (leading to jasmonic acid in plants). Allene oxide products have not been detected yet in mammalian systems but the possibility cannot be dismissed <ref type="bibr" target="#b405">(406)</ref>.</p><p>Another seemingly unusual variation on this theme is another plant P450 reaction, the formation of divinyl ethers from a fatty acid hydroperoxide, recently demonstrated by Howe <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">(408)</ref>. P450 74D1, a plant enzyme, catalyzes what can be considered a formal dehydration of a 9-hydroperoxydiene (formed from linoleic acid) to colneleic acid (Scheme 72). The trienoic acid formed from linolenic acid yields colnelenic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b407">(408)</ref>. These products may have biological activities in plants; analogous reactions in mammals are yet unknown.</p><p>4.12. Isomerization. A P450-catalyzed allylic double bond topoisomerization has already been alluded to in the work by Nelson related to pulegone oxidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b326">(327)</ref> and is shown in Scheme 50.</p><p>An unusual reaction reported recently is the trans to cis isomerization of 4-hydroxytamoxifen Scheme 73) (409). 3 The isomerization occurs with 4-hydroxytamoxifen but not tamoxifen itself, with liver microsomes or with several recombinant P450s, particularly (human) P450 1B1. 3 The reaction is of interest in that an estrogen receptor antagonist is converted to an agonist. This reaction does not involve a change in the oxidation-reduction state but the requirement for NADPH argues that either Fe 2+ or an activated iron-oxygen complex should be involved (the requirement of O 2 has not been investigated). A possible mechanism (Scheme 74) involves an ipso attack at the 4-hydroxy position and conversion of the olefin to a carbocation, which could invert before collapse to regenerate FeO 3+ . The FeO 3+ might dissipate to Fe 3+ and H 2 O as a result of electron input (Scheme 2), or conceivably a change in the juxtaposition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen could occur and be followed by another hydroxylation (e.g., R-hydroxylation to give the known 4,R-dihydroxytamoxifen product).</p><p>4.13. Phospholipase D Activity. One of the more unusual reactions observed with P450s is the phospholipase D-type hydrolysis seen with phosphatidylcholine <ref type="bibr" target="#b409">(410)</ref>.

This appears to be a hydrolytic cleavage of the ester linkage, in contrast to the oxidative mechanism described under item 3.3. NADPH is not required, and the reaction products are choline and phosphatidic acid (Scheme 75). Thus, the oxidative ester cleavage mechanism (section 3.3) does not seem operative [this would yield 2-(N,N,Ntrimethyl)aminoacetaldehyde, not choline]. The reaction could be demonstrated with several P450s purified from liver or recombinant sources. Antibodies inhibit a significant fraction of the phospholipase D activity of human liver microsomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b409">(410)</ref>. It is a relatively slow reaction (∼0.2 min -1 ) and probably only accounts for part of the phospholipase D activity known to be in liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b410">(411)</ref>. In contrast to other phospholipase D activities, there was no effect of divalent cations on the P450-catalyzed activity.</p><p>Exactly how P450s catalyze this reaction is not known. One of the most active of the P450s examined was human P450 1A2, and several mutants had altered activity. One dramatic effect of the mutants was substitution in the N-terminus. Some His residues in the N-terminal region could conceivably be involved in base-catalyzed hydrolysis of the phosphoester (410).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>P450 enzymes catalyze many reactions, and even the major mammalian P450s generally devoted to the metabolism of xenobiotics have been shown to be capable of most of these. One can view P450 reactions as being very diverse <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> or very unified <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">(131)</ref>. In this review, an attempt has been made to show that most of the reactions can be understood in the context of some relatively restricted chemical paradigms.</p><p>Most of the P450 reactions are oxidations. The vast majority of these can be rationalized by utilizing an FeO 3+ species, at least on paper. This may be a generally useful way to approach an oxidation that has been demonstrated to occur and for which there is at least a suggestion of P450 involvement. As discussed earlier, rationalization of a reaction in terms of a "classic" FeO 3+ abstraction/rebound paradigm does not necessarily prove that this is the operative mechanism in the absence of further evidence. The reduction reactions seem to be mechanistically straightforward, involving the transfer of an electron from the iron, although the competition of the substrate with O 2 is still surprising in many cases. More complex and unpredictable are the P450-catalyzed rearrangements. Some of these involve the intermediacy of high-valent FeO complexes and internal electron transfers, either formally one-or two-electron (e.g., section 4.11). Even more difficult to rationalize and certainly to predict are the rearrangements that occur without the FeO complex, e.g. the dehydration of aldoximes to nitriles (section 4.7) and the highly unusual phospholipase D reaction (section 4.13).</p><p>In looking at the total collection of P450 reactions that have ever been observed, we can rationalize the vast majority of them in the context of what we do know about Scheme 74. Possible Mechanism of trans/cis Isomerization of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen Scheme 75. P450-Catalyzed Phospholipase D Reactions (410)</p><p>the chemistry of iron-oxygen complexes. However, rationalization in the terms of inorganic biochemistry does not necessarily lead to reliable predictions of regioselectivity in proteins. Although some homology modelers might disagree, predicting the course of new P450 reaction is still not very accurate. Even ligand-free protein structures of the P450s have been a limited guide to prediction of what the ligand-bound structures should be. We have the dilemma (discussed earlier, section 3.3) of deciding whether catalytic specificity is the result of (i) only the influence of protein structure on substrate docking or (ii) an influence of protein structure on substrate docking, the nature of the iron-oxygen intermediate, and the interaction of the substrate with the intermediate. Another issue is rate-limiting steps, which has been discussed (section 3.3) and which are generally not known in P450 reactions. Our own work in this area (section 3.3), 2 suggests that the mammalian P450 enzymes utilize a landscape of barriers of similar free energy in the catalysis of reactions of interest in this field, and small changes may have dramatic effects in terms of influences on product distribution due to tampering with the transition state barriers (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b238">(239)</ref>. Another general concern has been raised by some of the reports of stimulation of P450 catalytic activities by added compounds in the context of kinetic cooperativity, especially with P450 3A4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b411">(412)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b412">(413)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b413">(414)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b414">(415)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b415">(416)</ref> but also with P450s 1A2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b416">(417)</ref> and 2D6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">(238)</ref> and possibly others. Are we dealing with a system of "induced fit" here? Comparisons of three-dimensional structures of archebacter P450 119 with and without 4-phenylimidazole may be used as evidence in favor of this view <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. If this is the case, efforts to use structures and models to predict the course of new reactions will remain problematic.</p><p>In conclusion, we will probably remain in an empirical mode of dealing with P450 reactions for some time. Recombinant DNA technology, high-throughput systems, and progress in analytical chemistry and spectoscopy provide experimental approaches to analysis of new chemical entities in regard to P450 reactions. The characterization of the chemistry of the iron-oxygen complexes and P450 kinetics is far from complete and should provide more insight into the details of the reactions that have been discussed. Finally, in regard to the issue of toxicology, new methods are being developed to rapidly provide information about bioactivation in rapid-throughput screening of chemicals, as well as in the prediction of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Scheme 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Scheme 1.
