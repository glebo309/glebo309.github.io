<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The development of novel enzymes for biocatalytic processes requires knowledge on substrate profile and selectivity which can be derived from separate databases and publications. Often, these data sources lack the time courses of substrate or product, and an unambiguous link between experiment and enzyme sequence. The lack of integrated, original data hampers the comprehensive analysis of enzyme kinetics and the evaluation of sequence-function relationships. To accelerate enzyme engineering, BioCatNet integrates protein sequence, structure, and original experimental data for a given enzyme family. BioCatNet explicitly assigns the enzyme sequence to an experiment, which consists of information on reaction conditions and time course data. BioCatNet facilitates the consistent documentation of reaction conditions, the archiving of measured time course data, and the efficient exchange of original experimental data among collaborators. Data integration is demonstrated for three case studies using the Thiamine diphosphate-dependent Enzymes Engineering Database (<ref type="url" target="https://teed.biocatnet.de">https://teed.biocatnet.de</ref>).</p></div>

The development of new enzymes aims at desired properties such as optimized catalytic activity, solvent stability, chemo-, regio-or stereoselectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[2]</ref> . The efficient development of new enzymes by computational methods such as data mining and molecular modeling is based on a profound knowledge of sequencestructure-function relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[3]</ref> Consequently, data on protein sequences, structures, and the effects of mutations on biochemical properties have become precious raw materials for successful protein design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[4]</ref> Comprehensive online repositories such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Protein Database, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref> UniProt, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[6]</ref> DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[7]</ref> and Protein Data Bank (PDB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[8]</ref> enable systematic analyses of sequences and structures of biocatalysts, while the experimental results from mutational studies are reported in scientific papers and are accessible by repositories such as NCBI PubMed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[9]</ref> Web of Science, <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref> Google Scholar <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref> or SciFinder. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref> This article is protected by copyright.

Each experimental data set refers unambiguously to the protein sequence of the respective enzyme. BioCatNet has been designed as a tool for experimenters to store, organize, retrieve, and analyze their own experimental data or data from collaborative projects. Experimental data include the reaction conditions as suggested by the STRENDA Consortium <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref> ,</p><p>as well as time-dependent data of substrate and product concentrations or of derived properties such as enantiomeric excess (ee values), conversions, or yields (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p><p>As an initial example of an enzyme family database, the TEED <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref> was migrated to BioCatNet (<ref type="url" target="https://teed.biocatnet.de">https://teed.biocatnet.de</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[46]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reporting of Experimental Data</head><p>The minimal requirements for submission of experimental measurement data to BioCatNet constitute a compromise between completeness and usability (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Therefore, BioCatNet distinguishes between mandatory and optional attributes for data submission. Since the description of the reaction under investigation was considered as indispensable to map sequence-function relationships, the involved substrates and products as well as the reaction stoichiometry are mandatory inputs. To describe the reaction conditions, the specification of the reaction buffer is mandatory, while additional information such as pH and temperature are optional but recommended inputs. All additional information on preparation of enzymes, analytical methods and other laboratory routines are considered not to be mandatory, but are usually documented in laboratory journals or by a laboratory information management system (LIMS).</p><p>Before experimental measurement data can be uploaded, BioCatNet requires the distinct protein sequence of the respective enzyme, which guarantees an unambiguous distinction between the biocatalytic properties of enzyme variants or homologues. We recommend the mentioning of source organism and expression host for a given enzyme. The usage of the SMILES code (simplified molecular-input line-entry system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[47]</ref> is recommended as unambiguous identifier of a substrate or product, which facilitates the search for experimental data by compounds.

Nevertheless, in many publications the respective enzyme is specified ambiguously by naming its enzymatic function and its source organism, e.g.</p><p>'pyruvate decarboxylase from Acetobacter pasteurianus'. A search for this term in the NCBI protein database matches 30 protein entries, which differ not only in length but also in positions distributed over the entire protein sequence (Supporting Information Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S2</ref>).</p><p>While highly similar sequences commonly fold into similar threedimensional structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref> and usually resemble each other in their catalytic function, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref> single mutations might affect the activity and specificity, even if the mutated positions are outside the active site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref> Specifically, the effect of protein fusion tags for affinity chromatography on activity, stability, and selectivity of an enzyme is often neglected scientific publications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref> Thus, protein sequence, structure, and experimental results have to be assigned consistently in order to enable a comprehensive investigation of the sequencefunction relationships of a biocatalyst.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Representation of Biochemical Data</head><p>It has been widely recognized that detailed results from biocatalytic experiments are an invaluable source of data for many fields of research, including protein design, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[4]</ref> synthetic biochemical pathway construction, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[58]</ref> reaction optimization and process design. Therefore, guidelines for reporting enzymatic <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[34]</ref> and biocatalytic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[35]</ref> have been proposed. Guidelines have also been proposed in other fields of research such as systems biology <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref> and crystallization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[60]</ref> Storing Michaelis-Menten equation is only valid under specific conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref> and excludes enzyme inhibition or inactivation by substrate or product.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">data</formula><p>The lack of time course data results from difficulties in data generation, especially in former studies when methods like high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or fluorimeters where yet unavailable. We suggest to make time-resolved data accessible, whenever they have been determined. Besides time course data, ratios like conversion, yield and enantiomeric excess allow for computational comparison of potential enzyme candidates, as previously shown for data on activity and selectivity for cyclododecanone monooxygenase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[61]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>The availability of original time course data enables researchers to determine kinetic parameters and to explore different enzymatic mechanisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> Kinetic modeling provides a link between individual biochemical experiments, and bioprocess design facilitates the search for productive reaction conditions to improve the performance of a biocatalyst and the overall process in a bioreactor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[62]</ref> In this context, the BioCatNet system supports both the design of enzymes and the optimization of reaction parameters by linking sequence, structure and biochemical data of an enzyme family within collaborative projects. While the current version of BioCatNet describes reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme, the data model will be extended in the future to describe more complex reaction schemes such as pre-incubation or cascade reactions.</p></div>

Providing consistently linked data on sequence, structure, and experimentally determined biochemical properties of enzyme variants will result in an invaluable information resource for directly deriving sequence-function relationships. Experimental characterization of enzymes and designed variants results in a large quantity of highly heterogeneous data, which is usually reported as plain text, tables or figures in publications or laboratory notebooks. It would be desirable if the information on the enzyme, the reaction conditions, and the biochemical properties were integrated and accessible to an automated analysis. In most studies systematic experiments have been performed by varying the sequence of the biocatalyst, the substrate scope, or the reaction conditions, and by measuring the respective catalytic activity, chemo-, regio-or stereoselectivity, but only a subset of most relevant data was selected for publication, which results in a substantial loss of information.

The two experiments were grouped into a single 'experiment set'. Reaction conditions and experimental results are visualized as tables in the web interface (Figure 4). A summary of the experimental setup can be displayed as full-text for a comprehensive documentation of the biocatalytic experiments. Excel files for the two experiments were created by filling in the Excel template (Supporting Information example1a.xlsx, example1b.xlsx) and can be downloaded from the documentation page (http://wiki.biocatnet.de/). Experiments with Measured Time Courses of Substrate and Product Concentration Time-dependent substrate and product concentrations upon selfligation of benzaldehyde to benzoin catalyzed by benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfBAL) were measured for</figDesc></figure>

While a publication usually contains only mean values and standard deviations, BioCatNet keeps all original time courses in a readable format for future analyses. The storage of original time course data allows for a model-based analysis of multiple data sets to study the effect of reaction conditions (pH, temperature) on the reaction kinetics, which might later serve as a basis for reaction optimization process design. Excel files of the experiment set are available as supporting information (example3a.xlsx, example3b.xlsx, example3c.xlsx, example3d.xlsx) and can be downloaded from the documentation page (http://wiki.biocatnet.de/).</figDesc></figure>

In BioCatNet, biocatalytic data is represented either as time courses of substrate or product concentrations or as time-dependent ratios such as conversion, yield or enantiomeric excess, depending on the desired type of experiment. The availability of original data circumvents the limitation of data retrieved manually from scientific papers and facilitates documentation of results. For many published kinetic parameters, the underlying original data or the detailed reaction conditions are not available, hindering in-depth analysis of kinetic properties by different kinetic models.
