  "_abstract": "In vitro recombination is a powerful tool for the tuning and optimization of proteins. It promotes the combination of traits from multiple parents onto a single offspring, thus exploiting information obtained in previous rounds of selection  [1] [2] [3]  . Recombination plays a key role in the natural evolution of proteins, notably in the generation of diverse antibodies, synthases and proteases 4 . In these examples, crossovers occur at well-defined domain boundaries. The role of recombination in evolution is less well understood when the domain structure of a protein is not obvious. Here, we introduce a computational algorithm to divide a protein structure into pieces that can be swapped by recombination and compare the predictions with data generated by in vitro recombination experiments. Ever since the first protein structures were elucidated, researchers have attempted to divide their otherwise complicated topologies into well-defined domains, defined variously as secondary struct"
