<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In vitro recombination is a powerful tool for the tuning and optimization of proteins.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> Illustration of schema disruption. a, Black lines in the structure represent peptide bonds, and the red dotted lines are interactions between amino acid side chains. Two hybrid proteins are shown. When the last four residues come from one parent and the remaining residues come from the other parent, three interactions are disrupted. When the last eight residues come from the same parent, then there is no disruption. According to our schema theory, achieving folded hybrid proteins is more likely when the fewest interactions are disrupted. b, The schema profile of this structure calculated with a window size w = 6. a b (a 'schema') <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . Solutions in which recombination divides a schema such that an offspring inherits fractions of it from different parents are generally less fit. To identify the equivalent of schema in proteins, we have developed a computational algorithm, SCHEMA, which can predict fragments that must be inherited from the same parent. Therefore, schemas will be the building blocks from which novel proteins can be assembled by recombination.</p><p>SCHEMA calculates the interactions between residues and then determines the number of interactions that are disrupted in the creation of a hybrid protein. A disruption occurs when an interaction is broken when different amino acids are inherited from each parent (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). In the simplest implementation, two residues are considered interacting if any of their atoms (exclud-ing hydrogen atoms) are within a cutoff distance d c = 4.5 Å, which corresponds to 5-8 interactions per residue. Ideally, an algorithm would search all possible crossover combinations and determine the associated disruption for each. Analyzing multiple crossovers by this method leads to combinatorial difficulties both in the calculation and the visualization of the data. SCHEMA overcomes this limitation by scanning the protein structure with a defined window size. Calculating how many interactions are disrupted when a crossover is made generates a schema profile S; if S is large for residue i, then the residue is involved in a more compact schema (see Methods). Crossovers that correspond to minima of the schema profile preserve the maximum number of internal interactions and, therefore, are favored. a b Fig. 3 β-lactamase schema. a, Schema disruption profile for recombination of β-lactamases TEM-1 and PSE-4. Nearly identical results are obtained when the calculation is run on the TEM-1 (gray line) and PSE-4 (black line) structures. The orange and purple regions mark large basins of disruption minima. Crossovers are predicted to be acceptable throughout these basins. b, The predicted schema mapped onto the three dimensional structure of TEM-1 β-lactamase. This figure was generated using MolMol 40 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlation with in vitro recombination</head><p>The SCHEMA calculation was tested against five experiments in which the genetic information from several parents was recombined to create random libraries of hybrid proteins. In each experiment, a subset of the crossovers survives the screen or selection by retaining (or improving) function. We compared the locations of the functional crossovers with the calculated schema profiles for functional hybrids of cephalosporinases <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> , subtilisins <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> , cytochromes P450 (ref. 23) and glycinamideribonucleotide transformylases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Nearly all of the observed crossovers appear in regions corresponding to minima in the schema profiles. The recombination techniques used in these experiments vary significantly, demonstrating the robustness of the predictions. We find that the window size that best predicts the locations of crossovers in selected libraries is 14, which results in domain sizes of ∼20-30 residues. Typically, three types of schema are observed: (i) bundles of α-helices (ii) an α-helix combined with β-strands and (iii) β-strands connected by a hairpin turn. Although the algorithm finds these schemas often, there are numerous interesting exceptions. For example, crossovers are frequently predicted to occur in the center of α-helixes. In addition, there are schema composed of complicated topologies with little discernable secondary structure.</p><p>The regions where crossovers are predicted to be deleterious are also noteworthy. For example, crossovers in loops can be highly disruptive if they divide interacting units of secondary structure. A common motif that demonstrates this effect is a single α-helix that is connected by a loop to a β-strand. A single crossover in the loop will disrupt interactions between these secondary structural elements. By the same reasoning, recombining isolated units of secondary structure can be disruptive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Designing ␤-lactamase hybrids</head><p>Although there is good agreement between the schema profile and the positions of crossovers found during in vitro recombination experiments, this agreement does not tell us the degree to which the total amount of schema disruption can be tolerated in a given hybrid. To test this aspect, we recombined two β-lactamases (TEM-1 and PSE-4) that share only 40% amino acid sequence identity but have highly similar structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> and compared the hybrid activities with their calculated disruption. The calculated schema profile of β-lactamase (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>) was used to divide the structure into schemas (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>); the degree to which the schemas interact was then calculated (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Based on the calculations, we designed hybrid proteins that have increasing disruption (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>) but show no correlation with the size of the recombined fragment or with the number of effective mutations corresponding to the recombination event (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). We then constructed this series of hybrid β-lactamases by piecing together DNA fragments of TEM-1 and PSE-4 by PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> (see Methods). In addition, we constructed the sequence mirrors of several hybrids. For example, for a two-crossover hybrid (three fragments), we constructed the hybrid in which the first fragment Fig. 4 Interschema interactions. The number of interactions between schema are averaged between the PSE-4 and TEM-1 structures. The thickness of each line is proportional to the number of interactions between two schemas, as calculated using Eq. 1. The thickest lines represent highly interacting schemas (&gt;8 interactions). Medium lines = 5-8 interactions, and thin lines = 2-4 interactions. Note that the purple and orange fragments are not true schemas; rather, they represent extended minima in the schema profile (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>). This figure was generated using MolMol <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> .</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> Designed β-lactamase hybrids. Structures of the designed hybrids of β-lactamase TEM-1 (red) and PSE-4 (blue), shown in order of increasing disruption (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>is from PSE-4 (labeled 'A'), as well as that having the first fragment from TEM-1 (labeled 'B').</p><p>We tested each hybrid protein for activity by measuring the minimum concentration of ampicillin required to inhibit cell growth, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (see Methods). Wild type TEM-1 and PSE-4 are highly active towards ampicillin (MIC ∼ 2,560 µg ml -<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">foot_2</ref> ) and have similar activities towards various β-lactam substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> . The MIC value is a complex combination of effects, including expression, stability and activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> . Here, we use the antibiotic resistance merely to determine whether a hybrid β-lactamase is folded and functional and not to rank the individual enzyme activities. By measuring the MIC conferred by each hybrid, we found a sharp transition in disruption, beyond which hybrids are nonfunctional (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref>). This transition does not correlate with the number of mutations that effectively occur when the hybrid is constructed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The transition divides the graph into two regions: 'tolerated' (nondisruptive) and 'dead' (highly disruptive). The region just before the transition may be the optimal level of disruption to target in creating libraries of hybrids. In this way, diversity is maximized while the fraction of the library that is nonfunctional or unfolded is minimized.</p><p>The eight hybrids that show activity (1A-5B) have interesting characteristics. Many have at least one crossover at a buried position. Additionally, a crossover occurs in the middle of a helix for two hybrids (2A and 2B) and at the end of a β-strand in hybrid 1A. Finally, six of the hybrids (2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 5A and 5B) have crossovers near the active site. Notably, several hybrids that were nonfunctional (7A and 8A) have crossovers that occur in a loop on the surface, with only a few residues recombined at the termini. Crossovers in loops are often considered to be nondisruptive, yet our algorithm correctly identified a crossover as strongly disruptive in this context. Finally, we constructed two hybrids (4A and 7A) that differ only by 12 residues near the N-terminus. Hybrid 4A was found to be functional, whereas hybrid 7A was not. This distinction would be hard to predict based on visualizing the differences mapped onto the three-dimensional structure alone. <ref type="bibr">Go 8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13</ref> discovered a correlation between the location of introns and isolated geometrical domains, a correlation that has held for a wide range of proteins. This correlation has been interpreted as evidence for the 'introns-early' theory of evolution, which states that the first large proteins were constructed from smaller domains through recombination and gene duplication <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . The merging of genes resulted in the separation of the coding DNA by regions of noncoding DNA (introns). Over evolutionary time, the introns disappeared where they were no longer necessary or were disadvantageous -for example, in the restricted genome sizes of prokaryotes. Proponents of this theory have argued that if introns appeared late in evolution, their locations would appear random with respect to structural domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . Our results indicate that the correlation between introns and domains could occur as a result of natural selection, even if the introns appeared late.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The natural selection of intron locations</head><p>Of the many proposed functions of introns, one is that they facilitate the swapping of exons <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . If the probability of a crossover is equal across the gene, then a long region of noncoding DNA will bias the crossovers toward a specific region of the fully spliced gene. Cycles of recombination and selection can bias the location of introns if the ability of an intron to promote shuffling contributes to the fitness of an organism. If, in a population of these organisms, introns were randomly distributed throughout the gene, there would be a selective advantage to Below the transition, the recombination events are nondisruptive. Above the transition, the hybrids are nonfunctional. The region just before the transition may be optimal for creating hybrid protein libraries: here diversity is maximized while structure disturbance is minimized. The color of the points indicates the parent of the first fragment: red is PSE-4 ('A'), blue is TEM-1 ('B') and purple indicates that the red and blue points overlap.</p><p>Table 1 Designed TEM-1-PSE-4 hybrid ␤-lactamases Crossover 1 Crossover 2 1 Hybrid<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> Number Context<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">foot_4</ref> Number Context 3 m<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">foot_5</ref> E αβ MIC 1A<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">foot_6</ref> 163 loop, surface 179 strand, core 7 6 2,560<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">foot_7</ref> 2A 189 helix, core 216 loop, surface, as 18 15 1,280 2B 189 helix, core 216 loop, surface, as 18 15 40 3A 130 loop, core, as 163 loop, surface 13 21 20 3B 130 loop, core, as 163 loop, surface 13 21 320 4A 65 loop, surface 42 25 320 5A 70 loop, core, as 216 loop, surface, as 83 26 320 5B 70 loop, core, as 216 loop, surface, as 83 26 20 6A 70 loop, core, as 130 loop, core, as 41 27 10<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">foot_8</ref> 6B 70 loop, core, as 130 loop, core, as 41 27 10 7 7A 53 loop, surface 42 33 10 7 8A 254 loop, surface 23 37 10 7</p><p>those individuals whose introns appeared in regions that are the most likely to result in successful shuffling events. We have observed this directly in in vitro recombination experiments.

Therefore, if introns promote recombination, they will most likely reside in lowdisruption regions after selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Crossovers that lead to folded, functional hybrid proteins occur at positions that minimize the number of disrupted interactions.</p><p>A simple model of interacting residues can capture this and correctly predict acceptable crossover locations. An important application of this approach will be to accelerate molecular optimization by laboratory evolution methods through the use of computational tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> . Combinatorial libraries with targeted crossovers can dramatically improve an evolutionary search by significantly reducing the number of mutants that must be screened to obtain specific functional changes. The elucidation and experimental verification of evolutionary dynamics will allow the design of a new generation of evolutionary methods that maximize our ability to discover new biological molecules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Calculating the schema profile. The schema disruption of a hybrid protein is the number of interactions that are broken when a certain pattern of fragments is inherited from each of the parents. If a hybrid protein is constructed from two parents where fragment(s) α is/are inherited from parent A and fragment(s) β is/are inherited from parent B, then the disruption, E αβ , of this hybrid can be calculated by (1)   where c ij = 1 if residues i and j are within distance d c ; otherwise, c ij = 0. Eq. 1 calculates the exact disruption caused by a particular hybrid construction (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6</ref>).</p><p>The probabilities P ij account for the fact that there is no disruption if the amino acid identities of the residue pair i,j in the set of potential hybrids are the same as in any of the parents. An alignment of the parental amino acid sequences is used to calculate the likelihood that novel combinations of amino acids will be inherited for a given residue pair. To determine the probability, the number of novel combinations is divided by the total number of combinations, p(p -1), where p is the number of parents.</p><p>Eq. 1 can be used to calculate the disruption of any particular hybrid construction. However, when analyzing data from in vitro recombination experiments, the number of possible hybrid combinations prohibits the calculation of the disruption of all possible hybrids and the condensation of this information into a useful format. To compare recombination results with the schema disruption theory, we have developed an algorithm that searches for the most likely regions for crossovers to be nondisruptive. The inputs into the SCHEMA program are the coordinates of the three-dimensional structure and an alignment of the parental sequences. The structure of only one parent is required under the assumption that the parents must share similar structures for in vitro recombination to be successful. A window of residues w is defined, and the number of internal interactions within this window is counted. In choosing the window size, the assumption is made that the probability that two or more crossovers occurring in the window is small. The window is then slid along the protein structure and a profile is generated where the schema profile of each residue in the window is incremented by the amount of disruption created by a crossover in that region. The numerical value of the schema profile function S at residue i is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(2) Σ Σ Σ c P i i j + w -2 j + w -1 j=i-w+1 k=j l=k+1 S = kl kl Σ Σ c P αβ i∈α j∈β E = ij ij</formula><p>If a residue has a large S i , then it probably participates in a compact schema. A low S i indicates that a crossover is probably tolerated at that position. For all of the calculations presented in this manuscript, the parameters are d c = 4.5 Å and w = 14 residues. The qualitative features of the profiles, such as the location of the minima, are relatively insensitive to the specific values of these parameters (data not shown).</p><p>Sequence alignments. Sequence alignments were performed using the BLAST algorithm with the BLOSUM 62 (ref. 35) similarity matrix and open gap / extension gap penalties of 11 / 1. In general, the sequence identity between the parents is &gt;60%, reducing the ambiguity of the alignment. For the β-lactamase TEM-1/PSE-4 system (40% identity), the availability of both structures made a structural alignment possible (using the SwissProt software package: <ref type="url" target="http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/sprot-top.html">http://www.expasy.ch/sprot/sprot-top.html</ref>).</p><p>Recombination data sets. For cephalosporinase, the schema profile was calculated based on the structure of cephalosporinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> .</p><p>The crossovers that led to improved moxalactam antibiotic resistance were located in regions of low schema disruption 3 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). Further, an independent experiment was performed by Levesque and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> in which a fragment was taken from the β-lactamase TEM-1 gene and inserted into the PSE-4 gene. The resulting hybrid protein was found to have wild type activity towards various antibiotics. When this fragment is mapped onto the cephalosporinase structure, it corresponds to a low-disruption region.</p><p>For the subtilisin families, Minshull and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> recombined a set of 26 subtilisin genes by DNA shuffling and screened the recombinant mutants for improved thermostability, high and low pH activity, and activity in organic solvent. When aligned, the 26 genes fall into four well-defined families. Within each family, the genes have ∼99% sequence identity. Crossovers between parents that have this high degree of sequence identity are impossible to analyze by schema disruption. However, the sequence identity between parents from different families ranged from 10 to 24%. It is possible, then, to compare the crossovers between families with the schema profile. In the experiments, crossovers were allowed in the region between residues 60 and 224. The remaining portions of the sequence (1-60 and 224-269) were taken from the Savinase gene. The structure of Savinase was used to calculate the schema profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). Nearly all of the sequences of the 26 parental genes are unavailable. To overcome this, we ran a BLAST search and selected a Bacillus halodurus serine protease (SwissProt entry P41363), which is 65% identical to the Savinase sequence. The probabilities required by Eq. 1 were estimated based on an alignment of these two sequences.</p><p>For cytochromes P450, a recombination experiment was performed on two P450c17 genes (rat and human) sharing 68% sequence identity, and a variety of functional hybrid proteins were discovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> . The structure of c17 is unknown; however, a structure of a homologous mammalian membrane-bound P450 2C5 has been solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38</ref> . The equivalent locations for the crossovers were determined by aligning the parental sequences used in the experiment with the 2C5 sequence (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).</p><p>For glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, Benkovic and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> recombined PurN and GART glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase and selected functional hybrid proteins. In this experiment, recombination was restricted to occur between amino acid positions 50 and 150. The schema profile was calculated from the structure of PurN 39 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hybrid gene construction.</head><p>The oligonucleotide fragments corresponding to the peptide schemas were made via PCR amplification, where the primers at either end contain a short piece of DNA that overlaps with the preceding gene fragment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> . This overlap ensures that the fragments will re-anneal to produce a full-length gene. The promoter for PSE-4 in the PMON vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> was used for the 'A' fragments, and the promoter for TEM-1 in the PSTBlue-1 vector (Novagen) was used for the 'B' fragments. The PCR protocol is to initially heat the template vectors and primers at 95 °C and then perform 25 cycles of heating at 94 °C for 45 s, cooling at 52 °C for 45 s and extending at 72 °C for 1 min. The fragment is then gel purified and concentrated either through ethanol precipitation (for fragments &lt; 100 bp) or using a Zymoclean-5 gel extraction kit (Zymo Research) (for fragments &gt; 100 bp). Once the oligonucleotide fragments are isolated, they are re-annealed to create a complete gene fragment through a second PCR amplification step. The forward and reverse primers have the sequences for the restriction sites of EcoRI and HindIII, respectively, so that the complete genes can be inserted into the PMON vector modified to contain these restriction sites. The times and temperatures are identical to the previous amplification round. A pre-PCR step can be used to improve the purity of the amplified genes. This PCR protocol is 25 iterations of 95 °C for 30 s, 5 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 2 min. A final extension of 10 min at 72 °C is done after the cycles are complete. The fragments are purified using the Zymoclean-5 gel extraction kit. Finally, the fragments are ligated into the PMON vector, which has kanamycin resistance. The vectors containing the hybrid genes are transformed into XL1-BLUE supercompetent (&gt;10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> ) cells (Stratagene) and grown on plates that contain 10 µg ml -1 kanamycin. Colonies are isolated the vector is extracted and sequenced. Some of the recombinant genes contained point mutations after the construction process (∼0.06% nucleotide changes per gene).</p><p>MIC screening. Each hybrid β-lactamase is tested for its activity towards the degradation of the antibiotic ampicillin. To rapidly screen for this property, agar plates are made with following expo-nentially increasing concentrations of ampicillin: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1,280 µg ml -1 . Aliquots of transformed cells are spread on the plates and allowed to grow at 37 °C for 24 h. More active hybrids will grow on plates with greater concentrations of ampicillin. The activity is measured as the MIC -that is, the lowest concentration of ampicillin that kills the cells. The XL1-BLUE cells naturally have a MIC of 10; thus, β-lactamase activity cannot be measured below this point. The wild type TEM-1 and PSE-4 enzymes have MICs of 2,560.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 2 Fig. 3 β</head><label>23</label><figDesc>Fig.2Schema disruption profiles compared with in vitro recombination data.
