  "_abstract": "The development of efficient and environmentally friendly methods for the synthesis of amides is of significance because they constitute the key functional group in a wide variety of biological and synthetic structures, including peptides, pharmaceuticals, polymers and pesticides [1]. Generally, the chemical synthesis of amides is performed in organic solvents and requires acyl halides and harsh conditions. To fulfil the increasing demand for green chemistry procedures (minimising the use of organic solvents), enzymes have been investigated for C-N bond formation activity in water [2]. The application of enzymes offers the advantages of high selectivity, mild reaction conditions and catalyst biodegradability. For instance, C-acyltransferase from Pseudomonas protegens has been identified not only as catalysing C-C bond formation in a Friedel-Crafts-type acylation [3] but also as exhibiting promiscuous N-acetylation activity, transforming aniline derivatives into the corresponding acetan"
