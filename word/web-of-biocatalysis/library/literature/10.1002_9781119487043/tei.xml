<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The development of efficient and environmentally friendly methods for the synthesis of amides is of significance because they constitute the key functional group in a wide variety of biological and synthetic structures, including peptides, pharmaceuticals, polymers and pesticides [1]. Generally, the chemical synthesis of amides is performed in organic solvents and requires acyl halides and harsh conditions. To fulfil the increasing demand for green chemistry procedures (minimising the use of organic solvents), enzymes have been investigated for C-N bond formation activity in water [2]. The application of enzymes offers the advantages of high selectivity, mild reaction conditions and catalyst biodegradability. For instance, C-acyltransferase from Pseudomonas protegens has been identified not only as catalysing C-C bond formation in a Friedel-Crafts-type acylation [3] but also as exhibiting promiscuous N-acetylation activity, transforming aniline derivatives into the corresponding acetanilides (Scheme 5.1) [4].</p><p>Semipreparative transformations were performed starting with 0.25 mmol of substrate. Anilines were converted into the corresponding acetanilides using phenyl acetate as acetyl donor within 24 hr and the products were isolated by column chromatography with high yields. Whilst aniline derivatives bearing an OH group in the para-or ortho-position were not converted, meta-substituted hydroxyaniline led to 96% product yield 2a. Aniline, including anilines with various substituents in the para-position (Cl, i-Pr, Et), was well accepted, reaching yields up to 99%. Furthermore, anilines with an ethyl group in either the meta-or the ortho-position were accepted, with the para-substituted substrate reacting fastest (2e; 99%), followed by the meta-substituted one (2f; 98%) [4].</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Enantioselective Enzymatic Hydroaminations for the Production of Functionalised Aspartic Acids</head><p>Haigen Fu, Jielin Zhang and Gerrit J. Poelarends * Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Biology, Groningen Research Institute of Pharmacy, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands Optically pure functionalised aspartic acid derivatives are highly valuable as tools for biological research and as chiral building blocks for pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and agrochemicals <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. Despite their broad applications, the direct asymmetric synthesis of functionalised aspartic acids remains a challenge. Current chemical strategies for the synthesis of enantioenriched N-alkyl-substituted aspartic acids are mainly based on the aza-Michael addition of appropriate amines to maleic acid, fumaric acid or their derivatives (ester, amide or monoalkali salt) <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>, followed by laborious purification and resolution to achieve the desired single enantiomer, and therefore lead to unsatisfactory product yields (&lt;50%). Biocatalysis provides a valuable alternative method for the production of chiral unnatural amino acids <ref type="bibr">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr">8]</ref>. We recently reported a biocatalytic route for the asymmetric synthesis of various N-(hetero)cycloalkyl-substituted L-aspartic acids using ethylenediamine-N,N'-disuccinic acid (EDDS) lyase as biocatalyst <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. EDDS lyase is a homotetrameric protein that belongs to the aspartase/fumarase superfamily and exploits a deamination mechanism involving general base-catalysed formation of a carbanion stabilised as its aci-carboxylate form <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. The enzyme naturally catalyses a reversible sequential two-step deamination of (S,S)-EDDS 1, converting 1 via the intermediate (S)-N-(2-aminoethyl)aspartic acid (AEAA) 3 into ethylenediamine 4 and two molecules of fumaric acid 2 (Scheme 5.2a) <ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. In this section, we describe the expression and purification of the enzyme EDDS lyase, as well as its synthetic application in the enantioselective addition of heterocycloalkylamines 5a,b to fumaric acid 2 to produce N-heterocycloalkyl-substituted L-aspartic acid derivatives 6a,b (Scheme 5.2b).</p></div>

E. coli TOP10 cells containing the pBADN (EDDS lyase-His) plasmid were collected from an LB plate and used to inoculate sterile LB medium (10 mL), containing ampicillin (100 μg.mL -1 ), in a 50 mL conical-bottom centrifuge tube. 2. After overnight incubation at 37 ∘ C and 200 rpm, the pre-culture was used to inoculate the rest of the LB medium (990 mL) containing ampicillin (100 μg.mL -1 ) in a 3 L Erlenmeyer flask. The cells were grown at 37 ∘ C and 200 rpm for about 4 hr until OD 600 reached 0.8∼1.0. Then, arabinose (0.05% w/v) was added to induce enzyme expression.</p><p>Cultures were grown at 20 ∘ C for 18 hr with shaking (200 rpm) on a rotary shaker. 3. The cells (4 g) were harvested by centrifugation (20 min at 6000× g and 4 ∘ C). Cells harvested from 1 L of culture were resuspended in lysis buffer (15 mL, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). 4. Cells were disrupted by sonication for 4 × 40 sec (with a 5 min interval between each cycle) at a 60 W output. After centrifugation (45 min at 10 000× g and 4 ∘ C), the soluble fraction (supernatant) containing EDDS lyase was separated from the insoluble part (pellet). 5. The supernatant was filtered through a pore filter (diameter 0.45 μm) and incubated with Ni sepharose 6 fast-flow resin (1 mL slurry in a filter cartridge used as column) at 4 ∘ C for 18 hr, which had previously been equilibrated with lysis buffer. 6.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.5">Conclusion</head><p>The enzyme EDDS lyase can be readily produced and purified, with about 60 mg being obtained from 1 L of cell culture.

We have showcased how EDDS lyase can accept the non-natural amine substrates 5a,b in the enantioselective hydroamination of fumarate, yielding the corresponding N-heterocycloalkyl-substituted L-aspartic acids 6a,b with high conversions (84-91%), good isolated yields (41-67%) and excellent stereoselectivity (&gt;99% ee) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.1).</p><p>In addition, we previously reported that EDDS lyase can accept a panel of homo-and heterocycloalkyl amines (comprising four-, five-and six-membered rings) in the selective addition to fumarate, giving the corresponding N-(hetero)cycloalkyl-substituted L-aspartic acids with excellent optical purity (&gt;99% ee in all cases) <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>. Except for the broad cycloalkylamines scope, we recently demonstrated that EDDS lyase can also accept a wide variety of structurally distinct amines for stereoselective addition to fumarate, providing (chemo)enzymatic access to various aminocarboxylic acids, including the natural product toxin A and aspergillomarasmine A <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>, difficult-to-synthesise N-arylated aspartic acid derivatives <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> and substituted pyrazolidin-3-ones <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref>.

The formation of new carbon-carbon bonds by biocatalytic Michael addition reactions has been demonstrated in both natural metabolic pathways <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref> and the biocatalytic synthesis of more complex target compounds <ref type="bibr">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4]</ref>. Lipase B from Pseudozyma antarctica has been investigated for the catalysis of carbon-carbon <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> bond-forming Michael addition reactions, whereby a Ser 105 Ala mutant favoured the Michael addition reaction 100 times and at the same time suppressed the hydrolysis reaction more than 1000 times. Biocatalysts are also of much interest for the construction of new carbon-nitrogen bonds by the addition of nitrogen nucleophiles to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds in aza-Michael addition reactions, which can be considered hydroaminations of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Aza-Michael addition reactions represent an important and well-studied class of reactions in synthetic organic chemistry, which offer great opportunities for new resource-efficient and sustainable chemistry, especially in cases where lengthy synthetic routes can be replaced by one step, protection-group free routes with high atom economy using highly enantioselective catalysts to avoid tedious purification of stereoisomer mixtures. Various lipases have been demonstrated to catalyse carbon-nitrogen bond-forming Michael addition reactions of various primary and secondary amines with a series of unsubstituted and substituted acrylic acid esters <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7]</ref>, as illustrated by the generalised reaction at the top of Scheme 5.3. High chemoselectivity and good yields were achieved in lipase-catalysed aza-Michael addition reactions by careful choice of the lipase and the reaction conditions; however, in the case of the substituted acrylic acid esters, enantioselectivity was not reported <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. As the catalytic asymmetric aza-Michael addition is an attractive reaction for the construction of new chiral centres and enzymes are inherently chiral catalysts by nature, it is worthwhile to search for enzymes capable of catalysing the direction of synthesis or degradation. Enzymes from EC class 4.3, the C-N-lyases, known to catalyse the cleavage of carbon-nitrogen bonds, can also be utilised to catalyse the formation of carbon-nitrogen bonds in the reverse direction. Such C-N Lyases are therefore excellent catalysts for enabling the highly regio-and stereoselective addition of nucleophiles containing terminal amino groups to conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds, as demonstrated recently by a number of examples from a great variety of aminocarboxylic acids <ref type="bibr">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr">12]</ref>. A selection of preparative applications of biocatalytic aza-Michael addition reactions using lipases and ethylenediamine-N,N ′ -disuccinic acid lyase (EDDS lyase) are illustrated in Scheme 5.3.</p></div>

Chemically competent BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells (100 μL; 100 μL aliquots were stored at -80 ∘ C until usage) were transformed with 5 μL of the derived plasmid by using standard procedures <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> and plated on LB agar supplemented with 50 μg.mL -1 kanamycin for selection. Selected E. coli transformants were used for expression tests, in which different media, induction times and temperatures were optimised.

The base can be used as is or as part of a riboside. Often, the use of this reaction is constrained by the need to shift the equilibrium towards the desired product. This is usually achieved by introducing into the reaction mixture an excess of one of the starting components or by selective removal of the poorly soluble target nucleosides (e.g. in case of Fludarabine) from the reaction medium <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. However, even under those conditions, the maximum possible conversion of the starting nucleosides into target compounds is not higher than 50-60%. We found that the use of salts of ortho-arsenic acid during the transglycosylation reaction shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of the target arabinonucleosides <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. The arsenolysis reaction can be expanded to obtain purine 3'-deoxyribosides. The shift of equilibrium towards the target product occurs due to the removal of ribose from the reaction: ribose arsenate obtained in the active centre of the enzyme is extremely unstable in solutions and decomposes, forming ribose and arsenate (Scheme 5.5). As a result, the equilibrium shifts towards the formation of the target nucleosides with conversion of 80-95%. Arsenate can be added both at the start of the reaction and after establishment of equilibrium. • High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Waters Breeze, column Nova-Pack C 18 , 4.6 × 150 mm, 4 μm) • Flash column (30 × 170 mm, Separon CGX C 18 , 60 μm, Tessek Ltd) • Rotary evaporator (Büchi) 5.4.1.2 Procedure 1. 3'-dI (100 mg, 0.38 mmol), 6-O-methylguanosine (50 mg, 0.17 mmol) and KH 2 PO 4 (27.4 mg, 2 mmol) were dissolved in H 2 O (170 mL) in a 0.25 L Schott bottle with screw cap. pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 3 M KOH (aqueous). 2.

The conversions of the preparative-scale enzymatic reactions were determined using the HPLC methods presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.3. 2. When the enzymatic reactions reached the stationary conversions (after ∼30 hr at c = 49% in the case of rac-p-CH 3 -phenylalanine, and after ∼48 hr at c = 86% in the case of p-Br-cinnamic acid), the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 1.5 by dropwise addition of aqueous H 2 SO 4 (10%, 50% w/v). The pH of the mixture was verified using pH paper. 3. The precipitate and cell debris were removed by centrifugation of the acidified reaction mixture in 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes with polyethylene screw caps at 10 000 rpm (10 947× g), 4 ∘ C for 20 min. 4. After discarding the precipitate, the produced or remaining cinnamic acid (p-CH 3 -cinnamic acid 2a or p-Br-cinnamic acid 2b, correspondingly) was recovered by extracting the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate (3 × 40 mL) using a separatory funnel (500 mL). After drying of the organic phase with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and concentration by distillation under reduced pressure, the cinnamic acid (2a or 2b) was recovered. 5. The amino acid (D-1a or L-1b) found within the extracted aqueous phase was purified by ion-exchange chromatography using Dowex ® 50WX2 resin (15 mL in 10% H 2 SO 4 ). First, Dowex ® 50WX2 resin (15 mL) was activated by washing the resin with 10% H 2 SO 4 (100 mL), and then the extracted aqueous phase was loaded. 6. The column was washed with H 2 SO 4 (10% -3 × 10 mL), then with distilled water (dH 2 O), until pH of 6-7 was reached (monitored by pH paper) 7. For the elution of the amino acid (D-1a or L-1b), 100 mL 2 M NH 4 OH solution was used. 8. The column was further washed with distilled water (dH 2 O) until a pH of 6-7 was again established. 9. The resin was washed with 10% H 2 SO 4 (50 mL) and stored in 10% H 2 SO 4 for further use. 10. The fraction eluted with the 2 M NH 4 OH solution was concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure, affording the pure amino acid (D-1a or L-1b).  11. The purity of the isolated products and their enantiomeric excess (ee) values (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.5) were assessed by HPLC, using the methods from Tables 5.3 and 5.4.</p></div>

Corrado, 1 Marcelo F. Masman, 1 Tanja Knaus 1 and Francesco G. Mutti *1 1 Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences, HIMS-Biocat, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands Amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs) are NADH/NADPH-dependent enzymes that catalyse the reversible conversion of ketones and aldehydes into enantiomerically pure amines at the sole expense of ammonia and a hydride source. The latter is required for co-factor recycling and can usually be formate or glucose <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2]</ref>. A second enzyme such as a formate dehydrogenase (FDH) or a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) catalyses the co-factor recycling. The AmDH-FDH (or GDH) system offers elevated atom economy, as the buffer of the reaction (HCOONH 4 ) directly provides the source of nitrogen and the reducing equivalents. Thus, only a catalytic amount of NAD(P)H is needed, whilst carbonate and water are the byproducts (Scheme 5.7). There are currently 14 AmDH family members. They have either been created by enzyme engineering starting from L-amino acid dehydrogenases (L-AADHs) <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> or been discovered as native (nat-AmDHs) using metagenomic data <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The substrate scope of these AmDHs already covers a significant range of structurally diverse carbonyl compounds, giving access to approximately 80 α-chiral amines in high optical purity. This section describes the detailed procedure for the preparation and application of four engineered AmDHs: (i) Bb-PhAmDH, engineered from Bacillus badius phenylalanine dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5]</ref>; (ii) cFL1-AmDH, a chimera obtained by domain shuffling from two first-generation AmDH variants <ref type="bibr">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6]</ref>; (iii) Rs-PhAmDH, engineered from Rhodococcus sp.

This spectrum served as a 'blank'. 2. Pooled concentrated enzymatic solution (20 μL) was added into the phosphate buffer (980 μL, 50 mM, pH 8.0; final dilution 1 : 50).

At this point, the dilution of the enzyme (e.g. 50×) should be taken into consideration by multiplying the obtained value (M) by the dilution factor (e.g. 50). The mg.mL -1 of the enzyme can be calculated by multiplying the calculated M by the molecular weight of the enzyme.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.6.6">Conclusion</head><p>AmDHs enable the one-step conversion of ketones and aldehydes into amines, as shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.6. The reductive amination of ketones resulted in enantiomerically pure α-chiral amines (&gt;99% ee) possessing R configuration, the only exception being LE-AmDH-v1 with substrate 35a, which afforded the corresponding S-configured amine (&gt;99% ee). Substrates 20a (89% ee (R)) and 24a (94% ee (R)) were obtained with imperfect stereoselectivity. LE-AmDH-v1, Rs-PhAmDH, Bb-PhAmDH and cFL1-AmDH show complementary substrate scopes. On the one hand, LE-AmDH-v1can be used for the preparation of acetophenone (10a), acetophenone derivatives (9a, 11a, 13a, 14a) or bulky-bulky ketones such as 32-34a, in which the carbonyl moiety is adjacent to the phenyl group. Similarly, LE-AmDH-v1 can give access to 4-aminochromane (from 16a), 1-aminotetralin (from 17a) and 1-aminoindan (from 37a). On the other hand, Rs-PhAmDH, Bb-PhAmDH and cFL1-AmDH accept similar types of substrates, but Rs-PhAmDH is the preferable biocatalyst for the preparation of amphetamines (1-6a). Notably, Rs-PhAmDH is active towards ketone substrates in which the carbonyl moiety is located two or three carbons away from the phenyl group (e.g. 27-31a). Finally, cFL1-AmDH is the preferable biocatalyst for the reductive amination of linear or branched aliphatic ketones possessing from five to eight carbons (e.g. 20-26a).</p><p>Large-scale reductive amination resulted in amine products possessing excellent chemical and optical purities, simplifying the workup procedure. In fact, the unreacted ketone can first be extracted under acidic conditions; after the change in pH to basic, the enantiomerically pure amine is extracted. The members and diversity of the AmDH family are expected to grow in the coming years, increasing their applicability towards the synthesis of more complex α-chiral amines. Further information about the enzyme sources can be found in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.7.</p><p>5. Knaus, T., Böhmer, W. and Mutti, F. G. (2017) Green Chemistry, 19, 453-463. 6.

Campopiano * School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK</p><p>Although an abundantly used chemical conversion, current methods for amide bond formation from carboxylic acids are inefficient. They suffer from poor atom economy with stoichiometric amounts of coupling agents, harsh conditions and the production of waste <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. However, the high polarity, stability and conformational diversity make them desirable functional groups <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>. Enzymatic routes for amide bond formation bypass these restraints through the favoured reaction conditions of an aqueous environment with benign components. One such enzyme class is the amide bond synthetases (ABSs), a subgroup of which are members of the adenylating enzyme superfamily (ANLs). This diverse family of enzymes activate carboxylic acids for nucleophilic attack through a two-step catalytic reaction. First, a reactive acyl-adenylate intermediate is formed by condensing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) with the carboxylic acid. This intermediate is subsequently captured by the incoming amine nucleophile to form the desired amide product <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr">[10]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>.2 shows the differences between the chemical and biocatalytic methods of amide bond formation, emphasising the requirement for an additional coupling reagent in the case of the chemical reaction. Using a biocatalyst as an alternative synthetic strategy has its own drawbacks, however, with the rigid substrate specificity limiting the enzymatic applications. Recent investigations into our enzyme of interest, Pseudoalteromonas tunicata TamA, a member of the ANL superfamily, have shown significant promiscuity with respect to the fatty acid (FA) and amine substrates, making this enzyme an ideal new member of the biocatalyst toolbox <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr">12]</ref>. Here, we describe the experimental details that show how TamA can be used to screen a range of FA and amino acid substrates and to prepare a series of N-acyl amides such as the N-C 4. The reactants were shaken at 37 ∘ C and 250 rpm for 24 hours. 5. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile with TFA (1 mL) -use 0.1% TFA for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis or 0.01% TFA for liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC ESI-MS) analysis. 6. The samples were centrifuged at 13 300 rpm for 10 min. 7. The samples were analysed by HPLC and LC ESI-MS (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ref>.9 shows some of the accepted carboxylic acids and amines). 1. Dodecanoic acid (20 mg, 0.1 mmol) in a 4% w/v DMSO solution, ATP (132 mg, 0.24 mmol), MgCl 2 (190 mg, 2 mmol) and L-histidine (155 mg, 1 mmol) in a 100 mM solution of sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0 (50 mL) were added to a 250 mL flask to a final volume of 100 mL. 2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the TamA ANL enzyme (1 mg, 1 mL). 3. Enzyme was continually added at 1 mg.hr -1 until a total of 5 mg had been added. 4.

The TamA ANL biocatalyst displays a broad FA substrate scope for chain lengths C 10 -C 14 , presumably via the corresponding acyl-adenylate intermediate. The experimental data also confirms the ability of the enzyme to accept a range of amino acid substrates, including L-and D-histidine, which provides evidence to support the hypothesis that the second step of the mechanism (reaction of amine with</p></div>			</div>
