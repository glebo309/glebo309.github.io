<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Enantiomerically pure chiral amines are of increasing value in organic synthesis, especially as resolving agents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> chiral auxiliaries/chiral bases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and catalysts for asymmetric synthesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> In addition, chiral amines often possess pronounced biological activity in their own right and hence are in demand as intermediates for agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Current methods for the preparation of enantiomerically pure chiral amines are largely based upon the resolution of racemates, either by recrystallization of diastereomeric salts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or by enzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolution of racemic substrates using lipases and acylases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> To develop more efficient methods, attention is turning towards asymmetric approaches or their equivalent, for example, the asymmetric hydrogenation of imines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> or the conversion of ketones into amines by using transaminases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> Attempts to develop dynamic kinetic resolutions, which employ enzymes in combination with transition-metal catalysts, have unfortunately been hampered by the harsh conditions required to racemize amines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Recently we reported a novel catalytic method for the preparation of optically active chiral amines by deracemization of the corresponding racemic mixture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The deracemization approach relies upon coupling an enantioselective amine oxidase with a nonselective reducing agent to effect stereoinversion of the S to R enantiomer via the intermediate achiral imine.</p><p>The S enantiomer selective amine oxidase used for the deracemization of (R/S)-a-methylbenzyl amine was identified from a library of variants of the wild-type enzyme, from Aspergillus niger, by using a high-throughput colorimetric screen to guide selection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> The library of variants was generated by randomly mutating the plasmid harboring the amine oxidase gene by using the E. coli XL1-Red mutator strain. Using (S)-a-methylbenzylamine as the target substrate we were able to identify a variant (Asn336Ser) that possessed significantly improved catalytic activity (47 fold) and enantioselectivity (sixfold) towards this particular substrate compared to the wild type enzyme. To explore the opportunities for using this variant amine oxidase to deracemize other racemic chiral amines we decided to undertake a more detailed study of its substrate specificity. Herein we show that the Asn336Ser variant possesses broad substrate specificity and high enantioselectivity towards a wide range of chiral amines.</p><p>Prior to carrying out further studies with the Asn336Ser amine oxidase, an additional mutation was introduced into the sequence (Met348Lys) that resulted in a variant enzyme (hereafter referred to as Asn336Ser) with higher specific activity and expression levels although its substrate specificity appeared unchanged (data not shown). Incorporation of an N-terminal histidine tag into the amine oxidase allowed facile purification of both the wild-type and Asn336Ser variant in one step, by a nickel-affinity column, to yield protein of &gt; 90 % purity as evidenced by gel electrophoresis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, see Experimental Section). Solutions of the amine oxidases prepared in this manner were used for all the subsequent substrate specificity studies.</p><p>A panel of amine substrates 1-51, with broad structural features, was selected to characterize both the wild-type amine oxidase and Asn336Ser variant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Each substrate was screened individually, at 10 mm substrate concentration, against the partially purified wild-type and mutant amine oxidase in 96-well microtitre plate format using a UV/Vis plate-reader. The rate of oxidation was monitored by measuring hydrogen peroxide production by using a coupled enzyme assay. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> For each substrate the k cat and K m values were calculated but for clarity only the relative activities are shown. These values have been calculated by  setting the activity of the Asn336Ser variant towards amethylbenzylamine as 100 % and reporting all other rates as relative values. In addition, for a number of the chiral racemic substrates which gave positive assay results, the individual R and S enantiomers were also examined to determine the enantioselectivity of the reaction. The wild-type amine oxidase was found to be inactive towards most of the amines shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Of the 51 substrates examined, only nine gave relative activities of over 5 %. The wild-type enzyme is most active towards simple straight-chain amines (e.g. pentylamine (11)) and generally shows poor activity towards more sterically demanding branched amines. By comparison, however, the Asn336Ser variant amine oxidase showed a quite different substrate profile with significant activity (^5 %) towards more than half of the substrates examined (33 out of 51). Eight of the substrates tested (3, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 31, and 36) were more reactive than a-methylbenzylamine itself with 1-cyclohexylethylamine (10) reacting approximately nine-times faster. The Asn336Ser variant amine oxidase showed high reactivity towards certain classes of chiral amines, particularly substituted phenethylamines (2, 3, 5-8) and 1-alkylethylamines (12-17, 19, 20). Secondary amines reacted more slowly (cf. 42 versus 1) although 2-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline 44 was oxidized with a relative activity of 20 % and the dimethoxy derivative 45 with a relative activity of 8 %. Other substrates of interest that showed good activity were 2-phenyl-2-aminoethanol (27; rel. activity = 50 %), endo-1-amino-norbornane (36; 183 %), and 3-amino-3-phenylpropanol (29; 20 %).</p><p>The enantioselectivity of the Asn336Ser variant towards 11 selected chiral amine substrates was then examined and the results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. The enantiomeric ratio E <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for a-methylbenzylamine was very high (E = 199) and was in general maintained with most of the other chiral amines. Such E values translate to ee values of around 97!99 %. Only 1-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline (44) and 1cyclohexylethylamine (10) gave significantly lower values (both E = 13) although even these values would equate to an ee value of about 85 %. Significantly, in all cases the Asn336Ser variant amine oxidase was found to be selective for the S enantiomer of the amine substrate (note that for 27 the R enantiomer is oxidized owing to the change in priority of the substituents).</p><p>For secondary amine substrates, for example, 42, 44, 45, 49, and 50 the possibility arose as to the regioselectivity of oxidation with respect to the amine functionality. Thus 44 could, in principle undergo oxidation to yield either imine A or B, or a mixture of both (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). To establish that the former pathway operated at least to some extent, we carried out the Asn336Ser amine oxidase catalyzed oxidation of (S)-44 in the presence of the reducing agent ammonia•borane which we have previously shown to be effective for reduction of the intermediate imine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Analysis of the chiral HPLC profile clearly showed that after 90 h significant production of (R)-44 had occurred. The formation of (R)-44 from (S)-44 can only occur via the achiral imine A and not the chiral imine B (see Experimental Section).</p><p>In summary, we have shown that a directed evolution approach, based initially upon screening a library of mutant amine oxidases for activity against one enantiomer of a specific substrate ((S)-a-methylbenzyl amine), has lead to the identification of an enzyme possessing much broader substrate specificity whilst retaining high enantioselectivity. The Asn336Ser variant shows highest activity towards substrates containing a primary amine group flanked by a methyl group and a bulky alkyl/aryl group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). In all cases so far examined the variant enzyme is selective for the S enantiomer of the chiral amine substrate. Other groups have also reported the identification of highly enantioselective enzymes by screening against single enantiomer substrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref> Although the A. niger Asn336Ser amine oxidase is suitable at present for small-scale deracemization reactions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> we are continuing to evolve this enzyme to develop an enzyme that has the required characteristics (e.g. stability, activity, selectivity) to be used for large-scale applications.</p><p>The development of enzymes possessing broad substrate specificity combined with high enantioselectivity remains an important goal in biocatalysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that directed evolution can be used to alter the substrate specificity and enantioselectivity of enzymes and moreover such variant enzymes often possess broader specificity when compared with the wild-type enzyme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref> The results described herein represent the most in-depth study to date of how the substrate specificity of an enzyme can be dramatically altered by a point-mutation. The ability to select for such enzymes, using appropriate high-throughput screens, is critical to success in this area and highlights the need for new methods to enable the detection of a wider range of enzyme activities than is currently possible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>   [a] The numbers reported refer to the enantiomeric ratio (E) for the individual substrates.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

A 100-mL aliquot was removed and analyzed by HPLC as a t = 0 sample. amine oxidase (0.215 mg) in 500 mL of 25 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.8, containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF and 300 mm NaCl was added to the remaining 500 mL of the (S)-44 solution. The mixture was shaken at 30 8C and after t = 90 h a 100 mL aliquot was removed and analyzed by HPLC. Some precipitation was observed over the course of the reaction.</p><p>HPLC sample preparation: An aliquot (100 mL) of the reaction mixture was extracted with hexane (2 150 mL). The combined hexane extracts were analyzed directly by HPLC: Chiracel OD-H column 46 cm, eluent hexane:ethanol 98:2 (v/v), flow rate = 0.5 ml min À1 , column temperature = 0 8C; retention times, imine A = .
