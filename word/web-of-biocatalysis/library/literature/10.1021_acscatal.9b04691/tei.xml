<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>By using structure-guided directed evolution, the substrate scope of the Fe II and -ketoglutarate dependent halogenase Wi-WelO15 from Westiella intricata HT-29-1 was engineered to enable chemo-, regio-and diastereoselective chlorination of unactivated C(sp 3 )-H bonds using NaCl as chlorine source. While Fe II dependent enzymes are often oxygen sensitive, variants of this halogenase could be screened in lysates under aerobic conditions. The developed biocatalysts offer a route to mild, late-stage chlorination on mg-scale of non-natural hapalindoles containing a ketone instead of an isonitrile functionality, thereby unlocking them for preparative biocatalysis.</p></div>

Two challenges exist with this enzyme class, first, competing pathways of hydroxylation versus halogenation, and second, early characterized members act on substrates covalently bound to a carrier protein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Only recently, aliphatic halogenases acting on free-standing molecules were discovered in the biosynthesis of hapalindoles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> a natural product class with a broad range of biological properties from antibacterial, antimycotic to anticancer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Although their molecular mode of action and the exact role of the chloride is unknown, it is truly the late stage chlorination performed by Fe II and KG dependent halogenases that drew our interest from a biocatalytic point-of-view. This reaction was shown for three enzymes from different biosynthetic hapalindole gene clusters, i.e. WelO5, AmbO5, and Hw-WelO15 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> Due to the novelty of the sequence, homology modeling to predict the active site residues failed until a crystal structures of WelO5 was released. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> By creating chimeras, the natural substrate scope of WelO5 was expanded to that of AmbO5 albeit with reduced activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> However, all natural sub-strates contain an isonitrile functionality, which is a major limitation considering that they are sensitive and rarely to never occur as synthetic intermediates or functional groups in drugs.</p><p>Herein, we report the directed evolution of an Fe II and KG dependent halogenase Wi-WelO15 from Westiella intricata HT-29-1 for the mild chemo-, regio-and diastereoselective chlorination of unactivated C(sp <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> )-H bonds of non-natural substrates devoid of any isonitrile functionality and we demonstrate that this enzymatic late-stage C(sp 3 )-H chlorination can be performed on preparative mg-scale (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). We initiated our study by synthesizing a simplified derivative of 12-epi-hapalindole C, which is a natural substrate of Fe II /KG dependent halogenases. The vinyl group was replaced by a methyl (1) and, more importantly, the isonitrile group was replaced with a keto moiety (2). These changes simplified the synthesis of screening compound 2 by several steps, while additionally the ketone functionality opens new routes to novel chemical diversification of this alkaloid class.</p><p>Initially, we cloned Hw-WelO15 from Hapalosiphon welwitschii IC-52-3 and a new fourth homolog, Wi-WelO15 from Westiella intricata HT-29-1. The two chlorinases have 94 and 99% sequence identity to the characterized WelO5, respectively. Transformation of compound 1 yielded 91-93% chlorinated R-1a with both recombinantly expressed enzymes, Hw-WelO15 and Wi-WelO15, revealing that the vinyl to methyl exchange appears to have little effect on substrate recognition. The isonitrile group was suggested to play a major role in native substrate recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> which we replaced with a carbonyl group in 2, keeping the H-bond acceptor feature. This functional group change abolished the activity of Hw-WelO15 and Wi-WelO15, under our initial reaction conditions, confirming the importance of the isonitrile for substrate binding in the wild type enzymes. By mass spectrometry, we could exclude enzyme inactivation by self-oxidation, a common problem for many related Fe II /KG dependent dioxygenases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> With the goal to create a collection of engineered enzymes for mild and asymmetric chlorination in organic synthesis, compound 2 was selected as our lead structure. Residues selected for mutagenesis are shown in green (1 st sphere, generation 1-3) and cyan (2 nd sphere, 4 th generation). Grey residues did not yield active variants in the 1 st generation.</p><p>To gain structural insight, a wild-type like variant of Wi-WelO15 (Wi-0) was crystallized. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Wi-0 differs by two surface mutations from Wi-Wel015, one at each terminus which originate from primer design. This has no effect on activity and expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> and <ref type="figure">S8</ref>). It has to be noted that while our work was in progress, a crystal structure of WeIO5 in complex with 12-epi-fischerindole U was reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The structure of Wi-0 was solved by molecular replacement using WelO5. In comparison to the structure by Liu, Boal and coworkers, the enzymatical lid of Wi-0 is shifted downwards, underlining the flexibility of these enzymes. Using YASARA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> compound 2 was docked into the active site of Wi-0 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) as well as in the open and closed forms of WelO5. The information obtained by the docking studies was used as starting point for structure guided enzyme evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> Next, we implemented an aerobic and lysate-based screening protocol, using 2 as screening substrate, for HPLC screening (see Supporting Information for details), and started a structureguided directed evolution campaign of Wi-0 using strategies reported by Reetz and Bäckvall. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> Based on their vicinity to the docked compound 2, seven active site residues were initially selected for single-site saturation mutagenesis (1 st generation, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). As a result, obtained hits from the HPLC assay showed primarily hydrophobic or small amino acids as new residues. In the 2 nd generation, the active site was reshaped by multi-residue libraries, allowing for cooperative effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> Small, targeted, libraries were designed by using reduced amino acid alphabets compiled from the single-site saturation results of generation 1. We used the DC analyzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> to reduce codon redundancy. The library sizes (screening effort) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> were designed using statistical guidance allowing for a 95% chance to find 1 out of the top 3 variants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> Wi-5 (A82L/V90P) and Wi-7 (V81T/A82M/A88V/ V90P) were identified as the best variants in the 2 nd generation. Meanwhile, we found N74R at the end of the active site tunnel having subtle positive effects on production of 2a. Hence, 1 st and 2 nd generation hits were rationally fine-tuned by adding the mutation N74R, creating the 3 rd generation. Variants showed a broad spectrum of positive and negative effects on the production of 2a, with Wi-8 (N74R/V81T/A82M/A88V/V90P) being the best hit.  <ref type="table">S5</ref> and <ref type="table">S6</ref>.</p><p>After screening generation 1-3, 12 hits were characterized with optimized reaction conditions as lysates obtained from OD600 normalized cell suspensions (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). Reaction optimization included the substitution of dithiothreitol (DTT) with ascorbic acid for Fe II recycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> and using higher sodium chloride (100 mM) concentration. We tested screening compound 2 and derivatives 3-5 with substituents introduced into the indole part of the substrate. Under these controlled conditions, Wi-5 and Wi-8 were identified as the most promising variants producing up to 60% of the chlorination products 2a-5a with &gt;99.9% regio-and stereoselectivity.</p><p>To further increase activity, Wi-5 and Wi-8 were selected as templates for another round of evolution (4 th generation). Learning from the effect of N74, we selected 2 nd sphere residues N74, S93, S103 and A175 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>) for a multi-site library and again used tailored reduced alphabets. Screening yielded variant Wi-11 (N74R/V81T/A82M/A88V/ V90P/S93L/S103A) and Wi-12 (N74R/A82L/V90P/S93D) as top variants producing chlorinated 2a.</p><p>Next, we verified the catalytic activities of the obtained hits with isolated and purified variants. Selected chlorinases were tested with compounds 1-8. First, we decided to probe the impact of the isonitrile/ketone substitution. As a result, the engineered Wi-WelO15 variants still chlorinate the isonitrile 1 with an expected reduced efficiency (Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>). Under optimized reaction conditions, Wi-0 hardly transformed the ketones 2-5 (&lt;1% yields), whereas Hw-WelO15 produced moderate amounts of chlorinated ketones 2a-5a, with 3 being the best substrate obtaining 3a in 33% yield. All natural hapalindoles contain either isonitriles or isothiocyanates, but our work demonstrates that some of the wild types, i.e. Hw-WelO15, might be more versatile than anticipated.</p><p>Using 2 mol% purified Wi-11 or Wi-12, 91% of 2a was obtained (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). When exploring the tolerance of indole ring substitutions, we found that the simple methylation at C5 or C6 reduced chlorination to 14% or 26% production at the best for 3a or 5a with purified variants Wi-5 and Wi-11, respectively. It is often recognized that certain enzymes/processes work better in lysate than as purified enzymes, benefiting from the presence of various cell components. Using lysates instead, containing a comparable amount of catalyst, production improved to 34% (3a) and 50% (5a) Wi-4 and Wi-8. Highest product formation from either purified enzyme or cell lysate reactions is given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p><p>Introducing the H-bond acceptor OMe at C5 recovered activity giving 42% 4a with purified Wi-5 and 54% with lysate of Wi-8. Products were found to be chlorinated on C13 with Rconfiguration, showing identical absolute stereochemistry as related 12-epi-hapalindole E. In summary, our chlorinase panel allows late-stage chlorination and access to 1a-5a with regioand diastereoselectivities &gt;99.9%.</p><p>Small structural changes in the terpene ring of 6-8 proved to be more challenging. Elimination of a methyl group at C12 (6) or sp 2 hybridization (8) abolished detectable chlorination, deducing that C12 position requires a quaternary carbon center for corrected substrate positioning prior to chlorination. Nevertheless, substrates 6-8 are transformed with moderate activity into several new products. LC-MS analysis assigned most of them to be hydroxylated compounds. Hydroxylation was not observed during screening, but the higher activities under optimized reaction conditions revealed minor hydroxylation of 2-5, too. Yet, our panel allows chlorination of 2-5 with excellent chemoselectivities of 96-99% (Tables <ref type="table">S5</ref> and <ref type="table">S6</ref>). Achieving such a high selectivity is exceptional because non-natural substrates for Fe II /KG dependent halogenases are predominantly reported to be hydroxylated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> Interestingly, despite their low activity, Hw-WelO15 wild type and Wi-WelO15 variants carrying I84H start shifting chemoselectivity towards 30% hydroxylation of 2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S16</ref>), an indication that chemoselectivity can also be controlled solely by substrate binding site mutations.  <ref type="table">S5</ref> and <ref type="table">S6</ref>) for 8 h and 30 °C in 200 µL with 0.5 mM 1-8 with either [a] 2 mol% (10 µM) purified enzyme or [b] cell lysate (prior to lysis normalized to OD600 = 5.0). Absolute stereoconformation was assigned by NOESY and crystal structures of 1-3 (CCDC 1839575-1839577). A detailed overview is provided in Tables <ref type="table">S5</ref> and <ref type="table">S6</ref>. [c] Yield after HPLC purification. [d] Total conversion, &lt;1% chlorination. Chemical synthesis of chlorinated hapalindoles and their ketone precursors involve early-stage chlorination. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> In sharp contrast, using lysates of our Wi-5 variant, we here demonstrated late-stage chlorination of 2-5 on mg-scale in a single step, producing 4.5 to 8.5 mg (7-48% yield) after HPLC purification of the new hapalindole derivatives. This late-stage chlorination opens new synthetic routes to structurally diverse chlorinated hapalindoles and will accelerate their exploration in pharmacology.</p><p>Finally, kinetics for the chlorination of 2 were performed (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). The 4 th generation variants Wi-11 and Wi-12 show the best vmax, with a 131 to 276-fold improvement compared to Wi-1. The mutations affect turnover and binding differently. Despite having a similar catalytic efficiency, Wi-11 is the fastest, but Wi-12 binds compound 2 more strongly. Variant Wi-5, which proved to be a valuable variant for scale up (Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>), was found to show highest catalytic efficiency with 2. The kinetic data reveals that our evolved chlorinases are as efficient biocatalysts for preparative synthesis as the engineered and mechanistically related oxygenase TauD <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> and the engineered flavin dependent halogenases PrnA <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> and RebH 56 with non-natural substrates.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.

All enzymes contain V6I/D284N. [b] no detectable chlorination.</p><p>In conclusion, the power of structure-guided directed evolution was demonstrated by evolving a member of the challenging class of Fe II /KG dependent chlorinases. It was possible to exchange the isonitrile, present in natural substrates, by a common carbonyl group. This mild, late-stage chlorination using NaCl as halogen source provides the unique possibility to functionalize unactivated, aliphatic C(sp <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> )-H bonds in the presence of more electron-rich functional groups, which is a remaining challenge in today's synthesis toolbox. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> We also demonstrated that our WelO15 variant panel can be used for late-stage chlorination on mg-scale with perfect regio-and stereoselectivity (&gt;99.9%) and excellent chemoselectivity (96-99%) under mild reaction conditions. With our findings, further engineering projects can be pursued towards substrates that have broader purposes. While this manuscript was under review, Hayashi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> demonstrated comparable evolutionary success with a martinelline-derived fragment, and Neugebauer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> identified a new family member acting on amino acids. Hayashi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> confirmed the importance of V81, A82 and A88 for the adaptation of this enzyme class towards non-natural substrates. Their and our residues might be considered as an important starting point for future engineering studies to improve the turnover number and binding constant of new non-natural substrates. We expect that structural investigations with our variants will reveal the ketone binding mode and ultimately lead to a deeper insight into the structure-function relationship for this enzyme class.</p></div>
