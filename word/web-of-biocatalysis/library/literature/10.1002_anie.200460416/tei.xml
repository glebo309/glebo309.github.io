<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The realization that many enzymes have broad substrate specificity fueled much of the growth in biocatalysis over the last twenty years, especially in organic synthesis. Identifying a few enzymes that show high stereoselectivity toward a broad range of synthetically useful molecules enabled organic chemists to rapidly develop new synthetic applications for these enzymes.</p><p>One current frontier for biocatalysis is reaction specificity. Can a single active site catalyze more than one distinct chemical transformation? Can small changes in the active site enable new chemistry in that active site? Over the last few years evidence has mounted that such catalytic promiscuity exists not just among a few enzymes but is rather common. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> This Minireview will focus on catalytic promiscuity related to biocatalysis-enzyme-catalyzed reactions that are or might be useful in organic synthesis. We will give examples of individual proteins with several catalytic abilities and also examples in which small changes (typically metal-ion substitutions or sitedirected mutagenesis) introduce new catalytic activity. The most successful examples are carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, oxidations catalyzed by hydrolytic enzymes, and glycosyl transfer reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Classifying Catalytic Promiscuity</head><p>Catalytic promiscuity in enzymes is the ability of enzyme active sites to catalyze distinctly different chemical transformations. The chemical transformations may differ in the functional group involved, that is, the type of bond formed or cleaved during the reaction and/or may differ in the catalytic mechanism or path of bond making and breaking. Most examples of catalytic promiscuity include both changes. For example, adding a vanadium ion to a phosphatase converts it into an oxidase capable of the enantioselective oxidation of sulfides (this is discussed in more detail in Section 4.2). These two reactions involve different functional groups-breaking the OÀO bond in hydrogen peroxide instead of the PÀO bond in a phosphate ester. In addition, the reaction mechanism differs significantly because one reaction is a hydrolysis while the other is an oxidation.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> catalytic promiscuity is organized according to differences in the functional groups involved and differences in the mechanisms of catalysis (for selected examples see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The placement of a reaction on this graph is subjective because the degree of similarity of functional groups and reaction pathways, whose details are likely unknown, is a subjective judgment. Nevertheless, this classi-Biocatalysis has expanded rapidly in the last decades with the discoveries of highly stereoselective enzymes with broad substrate specificity. A new frontier for biocatalysis is broad reaction specificity, where enzymes catalyze alternate reactions. Although often underappreciated, catalytic promiscuity has a natural role in evolution and occasionally in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Examples of catalytic promiscuity with current or potential applications in synthesis are reviewed here. Combined with protein engineering, the catalytic promiscuity of enzymes may broadly extend their usefulness in organic synthesis.</p><p>fication helps distinguish different types of catalytic promiscuity.</p><p>The largest group of reactions involves functional group analogues. For example, many proteases also catalyze ester hydrolysis. The bonds broken in the two cases (CÀN vs. CÀO) differ, but the catalytic mechanism is likely very similar. Several metalloproteases also catalyze the hydrolysis of PÀ O <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> or PÀF <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[3]</ref> bonds. Conversely, several esterases cleave the CÀN bond in b-lactams, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4]</ref> and proteases can cleave the SÀO <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[5]</ref> in sulfites or the SÀN bond in sulfinamides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[6]</ref> On a commercial scale, BASF uses a lipase, which normally cleaves CÀO bonds in triglycerides, to resolve amines by enantioselective acylation, which forms a CÀN bond. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[7]</ref> Asparaginase, which cleaves the primary amide in the side chain of asparagine, also cleaves a nitrile in an analogous substrate, b-cyanoalanine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[8]</ref> Pyruvate kinase, which catalyzes phosphoryl group transfer, can also catalyze sulfuryl group transfer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[9]</ref> Some phosphatases also catalyze sulfate ester hydrolysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[10]</ref> Enzyme inhibitors such as phosphonate inhibitors of serine hydrolases will not be included because they rarely involve a complete catalytic turnover.</p><p>Other reaction classes must involve changes in mechanism. For example, removal of a catalytically essential amino acid residue dramatically slows the reaction but does not eliminate it. The remaining, less efficient reaction must follow a different path. For example, a Cys-to-Asp mutation in a phosphatase retains some activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[11]</ref> Another group of reactions involve substrate-assisted catalysis, where the only substrates converted are those that restore the missing functional group so that it can actively participate in catalysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[12]</ref> In some reactions stereochemistry reveals alternate paths. For example, epoxide hydrolase converts one enantiomer by inversion of the stereocenter, while the other reacts by retention. <ref type="bibr">[13]</ref> These pathways must differ, even though the details are not clear.</p><p>Binding proteins can sometimes catalyze reactions, which is clearly a change in mechanismfrom no bond breaking to some bond breaking. For example, bovine serum albumin catalyzes Kemp elimination, b-elimination of 3-ketobutyl umbelliferyl ethers (a useful reaction in enzyme assays), <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref> and moderately enantioselective oxidation of amines to amine oxides with sodium periodate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[15]</ref> Myoglobin (an oxygencarrying iron heme protein) catalyzes slow oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[16]</ref> Site-directed mutagenesis to shift the position of the distal histidine (Leu29His/ His64Leu) increased the rate of reaction more than 20-fold and enantioselectivity significantly. Oxidation of thioanisole yielded the sulfoxide with 97 % ee, and oxidation of cis-bmethylstyrene gave the epoxide in 99 % ee. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[17]</ref> All catalytic antibodies are examples of binding molecules that can catalyze a reaction. Interestingly, a catalytic antibody that catalyzes an aldol addition by nucleophilic catalysis (formation of an imine between the substrate carbonyl and a lysine residue) also catalyzes the Kemp elimination, which  requires the lysine to act as a base. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[18]</ref> Another catalytic antibody that catalyzes decarboxylation also catalyzes ester hydrolysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[19]</ref> In principle, changes in substrate specificity cause subtle changes in the electron distribution in the transition state and could be considered as examples of catalytic promiscuity. However, these differences are usually much smaller than the examples considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Catalytic Promiscuity within the Same Protein</head><p>A classic example of catalytic promiscuity is yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, which not only decarboxylates pyruvate but also links acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde (a lyase activity) to form (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol, a precursor for ephedrine manufacture (Scheme 1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[20]</ref> This acyloin condensation involves an additional step-formation of a carbon-carbon bond-that does not occur in the natural reaction. Although Neuberg and Hirsch discovered this reaction in whole yeast cells in 1921, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[21]</ref> researchers more recently identified pyruvate decarboxylase as the responsible enzyme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[22]</ref> This reaction also demonstrates that the alternate substrates (acetaldehyde plus benzaldehyde) can be much larger than the natural substrate (pyruvate only). More recently, a single amino acid substitution in the more stable pyruvate decarboxylase from Xymomonas mobilis, which does not catalyze the lyase reaction, added this lyase ability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[23]</ref> The pyridoxal-dependent enzymes are another classic example of catalytic promiscuity. In most pyridoxal-dependent enzymes the additional functional groups in the active site Scheme 1. Pyruvate decarboxylase, a thiamine-dependent enzyme, also catalyzes the enantioselective acyloin condensation of acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde. Angewandte direct the aldimine intermediate toward a single pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[24]</ref> But in some cases, the aldimine can react by multiple paths. For example, serine hydroxymethyltransferase also catalyzes threonine retroaldol reaction, decarboxylation of aminomalonate, and racemization of alanine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[25]</ref> Site-directed mutagenesis of alanine racemase decreased its racemase activity and enhanced its minor transamination activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[26]</ref> Another carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction is an aldol addition of hexanal catalyzed by lipase B from Candida antarctica (Scheme 2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[27]</ref> Although the reaction was not enantioselective, the diastereoselectivity differed from that of the spontaneous reaction. The authors hypothesized that the aldol addition did not require the active site serine, and indeed, replacement with alanine (Ser105Ala) increased the aldol addition approximately twofold.</p><p>One reaction that forms several new types of bonds is a Michael addition with alternate nucleophiles catalyzed by Oacetylserine sulfhydrylase (Scheme 3). The normal role of this pyridoxal-containing enzyme is cysteine biosynthesis from Oacetylserine by the elimination of acetate to give an amino acrylate intermediate. Michael addition of the nucleophile sulfide to this intermediate yields cysteine. However, other nucleophiles also react including thiols, selenols, azide, cyanide, and some aromatic N-heterocycles yielding unnatural amino acids. Thus, besides catalyzing formation of a C À S bond, this enzyme can also catalyze formation of CÀSe, CÀC, and CÀN bonds using a similar mechanism. <ref type="bibr">[28]</ref> Recently, Maier engineered an E. coli strain for these unnatural reactions. Normal fermentation produced the starting material O-acetylserine and the enzyme; addition of nucleophile yielded the unnatural amino acids in 45-91 % yield. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[29]</ref> Lipases also catalyze Michael addition of various nucleophiles to 2-(trifluoromethyl)propenoic acid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[30]</ref> Lipase <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[31]</ref> and trypsin <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[32]</ref> catalyze the condensation of silanols and alkoxysilanes, respectively, which involves formation of Si À O À Si bonds. Trypsin catalyzed the hydrolysis and condensation of trimethylethoxysilane to hexamethylsiloxane in water (Scheme 4). Al-though silanols and alkoxysilanes are inherently reactive and can undergo spontaneous condensation or peptide-promoted condensation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[33]</ref> the trypsin-catalyzed reaction was at least ten times faster than the spontaneous reaction. The condensation involves the trypsin active site because addition of trypsin-specific inhibitors eliminated catalysis and because not all trypsins catalyze this reaction: porcine trypsin was effective, but trypsin from Atlantic cod was not.</p><p>Oxynitrilase, which catalyzes addition of cyanide to aldehydes, also catalyzes the addition of cyanide to imines with moderate stereoselectivity (3:1-4:1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[34]</ref> A case of mistaken identity due to catalytic promiscuity is an enzyme originally identified as a N-acyl amino acid racemase. <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> Gerlt and co-workers recently discovered that this enzyme is 1000 times more efficient as a catalyst for a dehydration to form o-succinylbenzoate, suggesting that succinylbenzoate formation is its true role (Scheme 5). By changing the N-acyl amino acid from N-acetyl methionine (the previous best substrate for racemase activity) to Nsuccinyl phenylglycine, which better resembles the succinyl- Scheme 2. Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CAL-B) catalyzes an aldol addition of hexanal. Although this side reaction is &gt; 10 5 times slower than the normal reaction (hydrolysis of triglycerides), it is at least ten times faster than aldol additions catalyzed by a catalytic antibody with aldolase activity. The calculated transition-state structure for enolate formation is on the right. Scheme 3. Michael addition of alternate nucleophiles by O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase to give an amino acrylate intermediate yields unnatural amino acids. Scheme 5. An enzyme discovered as an N-acyl amino acid racemase is 1000-fold more efficient in the dehydration to form o-succinylbenzoate. Both reaction mechanisms involve a similar anionic intermediate.</p><note type="other">Enzyme Catalysis Angewandte Chemie benzoate precursor</note><p>, the efficiency of the racemization reaction increased 1000-fold, making it similar to the succinylbenzoate reaction.</p><p>Esterases and lipases, which catalyze hydrolysis of esters, have overlapping catalytic activities with non-heme haloperoxidases, which catalyze oxidations by hydrogen peroxide via a peroxycarboxylic acid (Scheme 6). For example, esterase from Pseudomonas fluorescens, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[36]</ref> a lactonase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[37]</ref> and many lipases, <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref> show low peroxidase activity in the presence of a carboxylic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Conversely, at least one haloperoxidase shows low esterase activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[39]</ref> The overlapping catalytic activity of these enzymes stems from common transition states and acyl enzyme intermediates in both reactions (Scheme 7). In esterases, the acyl enzyme intermediate undergoes hydrolysis, while in haloperoxidases, it undergoes perhydrolysis to yield a peroxycarboxylic acid. The subsequent oxidation of halide to hypohalous acid by this peroxycarboxylic acid may not be enzyme catalyzed. In spite of this overlap, esterases and lipases are more efficient at ester hydrolysis, while haloperoxidases are more efficient at generating peroxycarboxylic acids. Detailed structural analysis of a related haloperoxidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[40]</ref> and an esterase <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[41]</ref> showed only subtle differences in the two active sites and did not reveal why one is a better haloperoxidase and the other a better esterase.</p><p>Catalytic promiscuity has a natural role in the biosynthesis of several secondary metabolites. For example, the synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin C in eukaryotes uses a single enzyme with a single active site to catalyze two different oxidative reactions-an oxidative ring expansion of the fivemembered ring to a six-membered and a hydroxylation of a methyl group (Scheme 8). Single amino acid substitutions can inactivate either activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[42]</ref> In contrast cephalosporin synthesis in prokaryotes uses separate enzymes for the two steps, but both of these enzymes are closely related to the bifunctional one in eukaryotes.</p><p>These non-heme iron(ii) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxidative enzymes can even have trifunctional roles. Gibberellin 20-oxidase catalyzes three successive oxidations of the C20 methyl group to the alcohol, aldehyde and finally to the carboxylate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[43]</ref> Clavaminic acid synthase catalyzes a hydroxylation, an oxidative cyclization, and desaturation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[44]</ref> Scheme 7. Mechanisms for ester hydrolysis and peroxidation by non-heme haloperoxidases both involve an acyl enzyme intermediate. In esterases (X = H), the H 2 O attacks this intermediate to complete a hydrolysis. In haloperoxidases (X = OH), the acyl enzyme intermediate comes from acetate added to the reaction mixture. Hydrogen peroxide attacks this intermediate to form a peracid. R = Ph for esterase, H for haloperoxidase. Scheme 8. A non-heme iron(ii) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent cephalosporin C synthase in eukaryotes catalyzes two different catalytic steps with the same active site.</p><p>Other non-heme diiron oxidative enzymes also catalyze a wide range of oxidations. For example, the plant steroyl acyl carrier protein D 9 desaturase normally catalyzes the desaturation of stearic acid to oleic acid but also catalyzes sulfoxidation of 9-thia or 10-thia stearate analogues <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[45]</ref> and the hydroxylation of 9-fluoro analogues. <ref type="bibr">[46]</ref> Methane monooxygenase, another non-heme diiron enzyme, catalyzes methane hydroxylation as well as a wide range of other oxidations including epoxidation, N-oxide formation, dehalogenation, and desaturation of benzylic substrates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[47]</ref> Degradation enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 enzymes, which contain a heme iron, also catalyze a wide range of oxidations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Natural Evolution of New Catalytic Activity</head><p>Divergent evolution is a natural process that creates different species from a common ancestor. This process also works on a molecular scale to create enzymes with new catalytic activities. New enzymatic activities arise by gene duplication followed by evolution of new activity for the copy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[48]</ref> Two examples of divergent evolution are the a/bhydrolase-fold superfamily <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref> and the enolase superfamily. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[50]</ref> The a/b-hydrolase-fold enzymes all involve nucleophilic catalysis but include a wide range of substrates and reaction types including ester or peptide hydrolysis (serine nucleophile), dehalogenase, and epoxide hydrolase (aspartate nucleophile). The enolase enzymes have similar active sites and catalyze divalent-metal-assisted general-base-catalyzed removal of a proton a to a carboxylic acid to form an enolic intermediate. Examples of different reactions catalyzed by the enolase superfamily include racemization (mandelate, Nacyl amino acids) and b-eliminations (o-succinyl benzoate synthase). An example of a "misassigned" enolase enzyme was mentioned in Section 3.</p><p>One example of a surprisingly rapid natural evolution of new catalytic activity is an atrazine chlorohydrolase (Scheme 9). <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[51]</ref> Researchers initially found that atrazine, an herbicide widely used since the late 1950s, did not readily degrade in soils, but since 1993 a number of groups have reported rapid degradation. The key enzyme in this biodegradation-atrazine chlorohydrolase, which cleaves the CÀCl bond-differs by only eight amino acid substitutions from melamine hydrolase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of a CÀN bond in melamine. Melamine hydrolase has low atrazine chlorohydrolase activity, but the new enzyme has no detectable melamine hydrolase activity. Directed evolution further expanded the substrate range of this atrazine chlorohydrolases to include C À S and C À O bond cleavage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[52]</ref> Another example of rapid natural evolution is the evolution of a phosphotriesterase that degrades the insecticide paraoxon. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[53]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Changing the Metal Ion</head><p>Metal substitutions can also change catalytic activity. One of the earliest examples from 1976 shows that replacement of the Zn 2+ ion in the active site of a carboxypeptidase with a Cu 2+ ion converted this peptidase into a slow oxidase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[54]</ref> Replacement of the Zn 2+ ion in the active site of thermolysin with much larger ions such as tungstate, molybdate, and selenate created enzymes that catalyze oxidation of thioethers to sulfoxides with hydrogen peroxide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[55]</ref> Replacing the active-site serine in subtilisin with selenomethionine resulted in peroxidase activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[56]</ref> Other examples of overlapping catalytic activity are acid phosphatases and vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases. <ref type="bibr">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">58]</ref> The amino acid sequence, three-dimensional structure, and active site are similar in both classes of enzymes. Vanadate binds to the same site as a phosphate ester presumably because it readily adopts a five-coordinate structure that resembles the transition state for phosphate ester hydrolysis. The vanadate ion catalyzes peroxidation by binding peroxide to the vanadium center, thereby increasing its electrophilicity. Further support for the similarity of the two active sites is the ability of vanadate to inhibit phosphatases and the ability of phosphate to inactivate vanadate-dependent haloperoxidases by displacing the vanadate. This exchange of active sites also exchanges the catalytic activity of these two classes of enzymes. Several acid phosphatases show low haloperoxidase activity upon addition of vanadate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[59]</ref> and conversely, apohaloperoxidases show low phosphatase activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[60]</ref> Sheldon and co-workers reported an enantioselective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides using a vanadate-substituted phytase. <ref type="bibr">[61]</ref> However, the altered enzymes were much less effective catalysts than the true enzyme: the turnover numbers were 10 3 -10 4 times lower for the haloperoxidase activity of a vanadate-containing phosphatase than for a true haloperoxidase, or for the phosphatase activity of apo-haloperoxidase as compared to that of a true phosphatase. This large difference shows that each enzyme is optimized for the reaction it catalyzes. However, like the esterase/non-heme haloperoxidase case mentioned above, even with the available X-ray crystal structures, it is not clear which structural features are responsible for the different optimized activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Engineering of Enzymes</head><p>A number of groups mimicked divergent evolution by using site-directed mutagenesis. By comparing related enzymes with different catalytic activity, they identified substitutions that change the catalytic activity. Making these changes in one of the enzymes altered the catalytic activity. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Angewandte Chemie</head><p>For example, four amino acid substitutions in a fatty acid desaturase by their equivalents in a fatty acid hydroxylase yielded an efficient hydroxylase (Scheme 10). <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[62]</ref> In another example, single amino acid changes in l-Ala-d/l-Glu epimerase introduced ortho-succinoyl benzoate synthase activity or muconate-lactonizing enzyme activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[63]</ref> Within the family of glutathione transferases, mutations changed a transferase that catalyzes a Michael addition into one that catalyzes a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[64]</ref> Similarly, a glutathione transferase with peroxidase activity gained steroid isomerase activity after five mutations to mimic the active site in a related steroid isomerase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[65]</ref> Mutations within an oxidosqualene cyclase changed the site of proton loss, thereby yielding different steroids. <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref> A much more challenging task is converting a noncatalytic protein into a dehydratase with low activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[67]</ref> 4.4. Glycosynthases, Thioglycoligases, and Thioglycosynthases Retaining b-glycosidases normally catalyze the hydrolysis of b-glycosidic links, but they also catalyze glycoside exchange under conditions of low water concentration. The reaction involves a starting b-glycoside (sugar-OR) reacting with an incoming nucleophile (HOR', Scheme 11). The incoming nucleophile is water in the case of hydrolysis and a second glycoside in the case of glycoside exchange. Retaining glycosidases use a double displacement mechanism with a catalytic acid/base and a catalytic nucleophile. In the initial step an a-linked covalent intermediate is formed by attack of the catalytic nucleophile on the starting b-glycoside. The catalytic acid assists this step by protonating the leaving group. In the second step this covalent intermediate is released by the catalytic-base-assisted attack of the incoming nucleophile-water or a new glycoside.</p><p>By disabling key steps in the mechanism, Withers and colleagues made three new catalysts (Scheme 12). The first, glycosynthase, results upon removing the catalytic nucleophile (e.g., a Glu-to-Ala mutation). <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[68]</ref> This removal prevents formation of the key covalent intermediate, dramatically altering the mechanism. Normal glycosides no longer react, but a-glycosyl fluorides do react, likely by a direct displacement mechanism. Glycosynthases, like the starting enzyme, form b-glycoside links. However, glycosynthases no longer catalyze hydrolysis of product, which is a nonactivated glycoside, and thus give higher yields. Five different glycosynthases have been reported with differing glycosyl fluoride specificity and differing regioselectivity (formation of b-1,3 vs. b-1,4 links). The second type of new catalyst, thioglycoligase, results upon removing the catalytic acid/base. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[69]</ref> One role of this catalytic acid/base is activation of the incoming nucleophile. Absence of this activator precludes reaction with normal incoming nucleophiles and requires strong nucleophiles such as thiols. Introducing single amino acid mutations into b-glycosidases from Agrobacterium sp. Abg (mutation: E171A) created a variant that formed S-glycosidic linkages in high yield (Scheme 13). The wild-type enzyme gave no product, possibly due to steric hindrance caused by the larger sulfur atom. Finally, removing both the catalytic nucleophile Scheme 10. Both desaturases and hydroxylases have a diiron center and oxidize C12 of oleic acid. Mutating four amino acids in a desaturase turned it into a hydroxylase. Scheme 11. Glycoside exchange using retaining b-glycosidases involves a double displacement. A glycosyl donor (b-sugar-OR) forms an alinked glycosyl enzyme, which then reacts with an incoming nucleophile or acceptor (HOR') to make a new b-glycosidic link (sugar-OR').</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Angewandte</head><p>and the catalytic acid/base creates a thioglycosynthase, which requires both an a-glycosyl fluoride and a thiol acceptor. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[70]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and Outlook</head><p>Catalytic promiscuity in enzymes is more common than generally appreciated. The dense collection of catalytic groups in an active site can accept alternate functional groups in the substrate and follow alternate reaction pathways. Small modifications in an active site can further dramatically expand the range of alternative pathways. In most, but not all, cases these alternate reactions are slower than the natural reactions. We hope that this review will encourage others to both search more extensively for catalytic promiscuity in existing enzymes and to use the current tools of protein engineering and directed evolution to extend the useful applications of enzymes.</p><p>Scheme 13. A thioglycoligase lacking the catalytic acid/base no longer catalyzes hydrolysis. However, using an activated glycosyl donor overcomes the lack of a proton donor for the leaving group, and using a nucleophilic thiol overcomes the lack of base to activate the incoming nucleophile. Thus, the mutant now catalyzes formation of an S-glycosidic link.</p><note type="other">Enzyme Catalysis Angewandte Chemie</note></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
