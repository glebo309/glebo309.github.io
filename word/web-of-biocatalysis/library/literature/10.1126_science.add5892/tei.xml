<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Therapeutic oligonucleotides have emerged as a powerful drug modality with the potential to treat a wide range of diseases, however the rising number of therapies now poses a considerable manufacturing challenge. Existing synthetic methods rely on iterative coupling, capping, oxidation and deprotection to achieve stepwise extension of sequences immobilized on solid supports and are limited by their scalability and sustainability. Here, we report a transformative biocatalytic approach to efficiently produce oligonucleotides in a single operation, where polymerases and endonucleases work in synergy to amplify complementary sequences embedded within catalytic self-priming templates. This approach uses unprotected building blocks, aqueous conditions and can be used to produce diverse oligonucleotide sequences containing a range of pharmaceutically relevant modifications. Our methodology is showcased through the synthesis of a range of clinically relevant molecules.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Main Text: Nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) are short oligonucleotide sequences (typically ~20 nucleotides) which selectively bind to target mRNA to modulate the production of disease related proteins. Drug specificity is defined by the base sequence, while chemical modifications to the phosphate backbone, ribose sugar and nucleobases confer improved efficacy, metabolic stability and bioavailability (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).(1,2) Until recently, marketed NATs were limited to the treatment of rare diseases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> However the recent approval of Inclisiran as a therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which affects approximately 30 million people in the USA alone, marks a transition in the field from low volume drugs to oligonucleotide therapies for the treatment of population based disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> This emergence of NATs for common diseases creates a significant manufacturing challenge as existing methods of chemical synthesis are not suitable for large scale applications.</p><p>Traditional approaches to oligonucleotide synthesis rely on solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry, involving iterative coupling, capping, oxidation and deprotection steps for each nucleotide addition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> Although powerful, this approach suffers from fundamental limitations which make it unsuitable for large scale manufacturing. The use of solid-supports limits production to &lt;10 kg batches. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> An excess of densely protected monomers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>) is needed to ensure efficient coupling which compromises atom efficiency and leads to the formation of by-products which must be seperated using washing steps. Moreover, final products require chromatographic purification, which necessitates the use of prohibitively large volumes of acetonitrile (1000 kg per kg of oligonucleotide) and contributes to large Process Mass Intensity (PMI) ratios (~4000 kg waste per kg product for a 20 nucleotide sequence). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> Due to the limitations of existing synthetic methods, currently marketed therapies are produced in &lt;50% yield with modest purities (~90%) and phosphorothioate (PS) modified sequences are produced as complex mixtures of stereoisomers. In light of these challenges, a number of elegant approaches to oligonucleotide production have been developed, including the use of nucleoside 3′oxazaphospholidine derivatives, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> phosphorus V reagents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> chiral phosphoric acid catalysts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and enzymatic approaches employing terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> While these strategies offer improvements in stereocontrol, step economy and/or reduced solvent consumption they all share the same fundamental approach of stepwise chain extension using sequential coupling and deprotection steps. Alternative strategies to construct oligonucleotides in a convergent fashion by ligating smaller fragments have been developed by Biogen, Almac, GSK and Ajinomoto. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> These methods have great potential for improving the speed of oligonucleotide synthesis and generating products with improved purity, but currently rely on fragments produced using phosphoramidite chemistry. Here we report a biocatalytic platform to produce modified oligonucleotides from unprotected nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) building blocks in a single operation. The process operates under aqueous conditions and does not require solid supports or large volumes of acetonitrile, thus addressing scalability and sustainability challenges associated with existing methods. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An Enzyme Cascade for Scalable Oligonucleotide Synthesis</head><p>Our strategy uses a DNA polymerase and NTP building blocks, to extend a catalytic self-priming hairpin template (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). An Endonuclease V (EndoV) then selectively cleaves a single strand of the resulting duplex DNA downstream of an inosine base built into the hairpin sequence, releasing the product and regenerating the template. Given that the polymerase is larger than the extended DNA the endonuclease is unable to bind to the template until the polymerase is released, thus avoiding premature cleavage of partially amplified sequences. The process is designed to operate under isothermal conditions above the product melting temperature (Tm), to facilitate scale-up and to ensure effective dissociation of the cleaved product from the template. In this way, repeated cycles of polymerase extension and endonuclease cleavage result in accumulation of the desired oligonucleotide product. Our approach has some similarities to alternative DNA amplification methods such as those used in biosensing, bioimaging and genome sequencing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref> but is specifically tailored towards the large-scale production of short modified oligonucleotides typical of those used as therapeutics. Unlike alternative methods our system does not require stoichiometric primers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> delivers unscarred products, and does not generate oligonucleotide by-products which complicate purification and compromise process efficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref> To evaluate the potential of the proposed cascade, we first assessed the extension and cleavage steps in isolation. The B-family polymerase from Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 (KOD) efficiently extended a self-priming template (T1) with deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to afford the double stranded product (E1) in quantitative conversion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1A</ref>). The cleavage reaction performed using an endonuclease from Thermotoga maritima (TmEndoV) also proceeded to completion providing the 18mer product (P1) and template (T1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1B</ref>). With the individual steps working as intended, we performed a one-pot cascade using KOD polymerase, TmEndoV endonuclease, T1 <ref type="bibr">(20 µM)</ref> and dNTPs (250 µM each). Encouragingly, under these conditions the target sequence (28 µM) was produced as the sole product, which correlates with 78% consumption of the limiting dTTP reagent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S1C</ref>).</p><p>To intensify the process, we next investigated the effect of increased substrate (dNTP) loading on the individual steps. While KOD polymerase was able to efficiently extend T1 in the presence of 30 mM dNTPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2A</ref>), TmEndoV endonuclease mediated hydrolysis was inhibited at dNTP concentrations &gt;2.0 mM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2B</ref>). To address this limitation, we evaluated a panel of thermophilic TmEndoV homologs and identified an endonuclease from Thermotoga neapolitana (TnEndoV) that operates effectively at high dNTP concentrations, catalyzing complete hydrolysis of E1 <ref type="bibr">(20 µM)</ref> in the presence of 20 mM dNTPs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S2C</ref>). Following optimization of buffer conditions, hairpin sequences and reaction temperature (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>), 330 cycles of template extension and product cleavage were achieved in analytical scale reactions (20 µL) under isothermal conditions, affording 0.33 mM P1 as the sole product (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). Next, a reaction was performed on a 5 mL scale which provided 0.44 mM P1 (equivalent to 2.5 g/L), consuming 69% of the available dNTP starting materials. Following removal of the proteins and membrane filtration, P1 was isolated in 88% purity (11.5 mg, 2.1 µmol) without chromatographic purification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). Although in this instance we did not attempt to separate the catalytic template (&lt;1mol%) from P1, there are numerous opportunities for template removal and/or recycling (vide infra). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> Finally, to demonstrate that our processes can be readily scaled without compromising efficiency, we performed a biotransformation on a 50 ml scale, delivering 123 mg P1 (22.2 µmol) with 89% purity following protein precipitation and membrane filtration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6</ref>).</p><p>Using the metrics of our 50 mL scale reaction, a process mass intensity (PMI) analysis was performed to evaluate the material efficiency of the process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). Even at this early stage of development, the enzymatic approach compares favourably to traditional phosphoramidite chemistry (530 Kg compared to ~4000 Kg raw material per Kg product <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>). This improvement in PMI was primarily achieved by alleviating the need for multiple washing steps and chromatographic purification. While the template used in our enzymatic approach is currently produced using phosphoramidite chemistry, this is only required in catalytic quantities (&lt;1%) and thus has substantially reduced economic and environmental impact compared with producing large quantities of DNA products chemically. Moreover, there is the potential to generate catalytic templates using enzymatic methods in the future, which would provide further improvements in green chemistry metrics. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Biocatalytic Synthesis of Modified Sequences</head><p>To manufacture therapeutic oligonucleotides, we require polymerases and endonucleases with activity towards modified nucleic acids. To this end, eight thermophilic polymerases were selected for evaluation and used to extend a hairpin template encoding the sequence TCAGTCAG (T2) using a mixture of 3 unmodified dNTPs and one modified NTP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Polymerases able to transcribe the template and incorporate two copies of a modified NTP resulted in full length extension. Control reactions were also performed in the absence of modified NTP. From this preliminary screen, several polymerases were identified with good activity towards NTP substrates containing Sp-PS (Sp-2), 2'fluoro (3), and a combination of Sp-PS and 2'-fluoro (4) modifications, including KOD and TfPol* polymerases, as evidenced by PAGE analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> &amp; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S7</ref>). More modest activity towards 2'-MeO-NTP substrates (5) was observed with several polymerases including SFM4-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, TfPol* and Dpo4*, while KOD DGLNK <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> and SFM4-6 display modest activity with LNA modified substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. No activity was observed towards Rp-stereoisomers of α-PS modified dNTPs (Rp-2) with any of the polymerases tested. 2'-O-Methoxyethyl (2'-MOE) modified NTPs are not commercially available and were not evaluated in this study; however, a variant of Tgo polymerase has recently been reported that has activity towards 2'-MOE-NTPs, making us optimistic that our methodology will be extendable to this class of substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> Similarly, therapeutic oligonucleotides containing nucleobase modifications (e.g. 5'-methylated pyrimidines) should also be accessible with our technology, as polymerases have been shown to accept a wide range of base modified NTPs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Having identified promising polymerases, we next explored sequential incorporations of modified NTPs by extending templates (T3-T6) encoding eight copies of a single nucleobase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). Consistent with the initial screen, LC-MS analysis shows that selected polymerases were highly active towards substrates 1-4, with reactions proceeding to completion within 1 hour (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S8</ref>). While single nucleotide overextension products are often observed with these substrates, overextension is dramatically reduced in cascade processes in the presence of EndoV endonucleases (vide infra). Reactions with each of the four 2'-MeO (5) and LNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> modified NTPs gave rise to mixtures of partially extended products (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">S8</ref>), consistent with modest polymerase activity towards these modifications. We anticipate that efficient production of these sequences can be achieved through further enzyme engineering.</p><p>With suitable polymerases in hand, we next evaluated the panel of EndoV endonucleases for activity towards extended templates containing 2'-fluoro (E3), 2'-methoxy (E5) and 2'-O-methoxyethyl (E7) ribose modifications, LNAs (E6 &amp; E8) and PS linkages (E2) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S9</ref> &amp; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S10</ref>). Hydrolysis of E3, E5 and E7 proceeded to &gt;90% conversion, and pleasingly endonuclease TnEndoV, which tolerates elevated NTP concentrations, performs consistently well across the substrate range (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). Interestingly, while cleavage of an LNA modified 18mer (E6) was sluggish, sequences containing a single LNA 3' of the cleavage site (E8) were efficiently hydrolysed. The modest activity observed with E6 likely arises from distorted secondary structure of the LNA-DNA duplex <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. However, we note that therapeutic oligonucleotides rarely contain more than 3 sequential LNAs in their sequence. Endonuclease catalyzed cleavage of stereorandom PS modified DNA Rp/Sp-(E2) stalled at 50% conversion. The most likely explanation for this behaviour is that the endonucleases are sensitive to the stereochemistry at the phosphorothioate centre undergoing hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis we synthesized a stereodefined extended template using KOD polymerase and Sp-dNTPαS. Several polymerases have been shown to incorporate Sp-dNTPαS into oligonucleotides with inversion of stereochemistry, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> meaning that the oligonucleotide product is expected to contain Rp linkages. In this case, endonuclease TnEndoV mediated cleavage proceeded to completion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref> &amp; S11) suggesting that endonucleases are Rp-selective and can be used to cleave enzymatically synthesized products. Cascade reactions were performed using KOD and TnEndoV. B) Oligonucleotides with varying sequence and chemical modifications were produced in one-pot biotransformations using the most suitable polymerase (Pol.) and TnEndoV. For comparison, under optimized conditions the unmodified product P1 was produced following 330 cycles (37% conv.). The percentage conversion (% conv.) describes the conversion of NTP starting material to product. Cycles refers to the number of moles of product formed per mole of template. For specific reaction conditions see Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>.</p><p>Next, attention turned to one-pot cascade reactions to produce modified sequences. First, we took advantage of polymerase specificity to produce 6-mer and 7-mers containing a single PS linkage as single diastereomers (&gt;99% d.e.). These sequences can be produced using either pure Sp-dNTPαS or Rp/Sp-dNTPαS mixtures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S12</ref>). To highlight the versatility of our approach, we successfully amplified a range of 8mer oligonucleotide products (P2-P16) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">S13</ref>) with different base sequences and a variety of 2'F, 2'-MeO, Rp-PS, Rp-2'F-PS and LNA modifications. In favourable cases, up to 238 cycles of template extension and product cleavage were achieved (238 moles of product per mole of template), consuming 76% of the NTP starting materials. The NTP concentrations used in these reactions are lower than those used earlier with unmodified dNTPs due to the lower concentrations of modifed NTPs currently available from commercial suppliers. We anticipate that substantially improved turnovers will be achieved by increasing NTP concentrations and through specific optimization of reaction conditions for the target sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Production of Clinically Relevant Oligonucleotides</head><p>To further showcase the utility of our methodology, we produced a range of clinically relevant oligonucleotide sequences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">S14</ref>). First, we synthesized Prexigebersen, an unmodified liposome-incorporated oligonucleotide currently under evaluation in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. Prexigebersen was produced in 0.44 mM (equivalent to 2.4 g/L), which is comparable to the product titres achieved in earlier experiments with P1 demonstrating the transferability of the technology to different sequences. We also produced selected fragments of the FDA approved aptamer Pegaptanib (2'-MeO and 2'-F modifications), and gapmers Mipomersen (PS modifications) and Inotersen (PS modifications). These fragments could potentially be integrated into convergent ligation based oligonucleotide assembly strategies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref> Finally, we synthesized the PS modified oligonucleotide therapies Fomivirsen, Alicaforsen, Trabedersen and Aganirsen, as single stereoisomers. Subsequent production of Fomivirsen, a 21mer that was the first approved antisense oligonucleotide therapy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), on a preparative scale (0.75 mL) demonstrates how reaction intensification can deliver improved conversions. Following concentration of commercial Sp-dNTPαS stocks and optimization of reaction parameters, the target sequence was produced (0.26 mM, equivalent to 1.7 g/L, 195 nmol) following 65 cycles of template extension and product cleavage, which correlates to consumption of 90% of the available Sp-dNTPαS starting materials. Product isolatation was achieved following protein precipitation, DNAse catalyzed template degradation and filtration steps to provide Fomivirsen (0.73 mg, 108 nmol) as an all-Rp single diastereoisomer in 87% purity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">S15</ref>). The biophysical and biochemical properties of enzymatically synthesized Fomivirsen were compared to stereorandom material produced by chemical synthesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref> Thermal denaturation studies showed that the all-Rp stereoisomer has higher binding affinity to the target RNA compared to the stereorandom mixture (Tm 69 ± 0.8°C and 64 ± 0.3°C respectively). Assays with RNase H non-specific endonucleases show that E.coli RNase H activity is unaffected by oligonucleotide stereochemistry, while the human enzyme is ca. 2-fold more active with stereorandom Fomivirsen compared to the all-Rp stereoisomer (Fig <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">S16</ref>). Investigations into Fomivirsen stability showed that phosphodiesterase from Crotalus adamanteus preferentially degraded the all-Rp oligonucleotide, whereas stereorandom Fomivirsen was more rapidly degraded by S1 nuclease from Aspergillus oryzae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">S17</ref>). A third endonuclease from Staphylococcus aureus showed comparable activity with either sample, showing that the rate of oligonucleotide degradation is strongly dependent upon the specific nuclease. crude HPLC traces are shown in Figure S14. For specific reaction conditions see Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>. B) Preparative scale synthesis of Fomivirsen as a single stereoisomer. LC-MS trace and image of the isolated product.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>This study offers a new paradigm in therapeutic oligonucleotide manufacturing, where iterative rounds of chain extension, oxidation, capping and deprotection are replaced by a single biotransformation. Our approach provides access to a diverse array of oligonucleotide sequences, which will be further expanded through the discovery and/or engineering of biocatalysts with extended substrate scope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref> For example, the development of polymerases with activity towards Rp-dNTPαS will enable production of libraries of stereochemically defined PS modified oligonucleotides for biological evaluation, ultimately leading to therapeutics with improved safety and efficacy. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the stereopreference of polymerases and cyclic guanosine-adenosine synthase (cGAS) can be altered by exchanging the Mg 2+ cofactor and protein engineering. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref> Similarly, directed evolution will generate more robust biocatalysts specifically engineered to meet target process parameters. Translation of our approach into oligonucleotide manufacturing processes will also be facilitated by the development of scalable and low-cost routes to the required NTP building blocks. These NTPs will likely be accessed from the corresponding nucleoside, a common intermediate in phosphoramidite production, using enzymatic phosphorylation methods which have been previously demonstrated at scale.( <ref type="formula">46</ref>) Thus the biocatalytic platform described within has the potential to transform the way that nucleic acid therapeutics are manufactured, addressing imminent scalability and sustainability challenges associated with the production of this emerging class of therapeutics.</p></div>

Fig. S8: Polymerase activity towards sequential incorporation of modified NTPs continues next page  Fig. S8: Polymerase activity towards sequential incorporation of modified NTPs. Templates (T3-T6, 20 µM) encoding eight copies of a single nucleobase, were extended using the complementary NTP (1 mM) and the most suitable polymerase (0.2 µM) identified from the preliminary substrate scope (Figure S7). KOD was used to incorporate unmodified dNTPs, Sp-dNTPαS and Sp-2'F'-NTPαS, and Tfpol* was used to incorporate 2'F-NTPs, reactions were incubated for 1 hour. Dpo4* was used to incorporate 2'MeO-NTPs and KOD DGLNK for LNA-NTPs, reactions were incubated for 4 and 12 hours respectively. A) Denaturing PAGE analysis showing the extended products; Reaction products were compared to standards including the starting template (T2) and the extended product (Ext. prod). B) LC-MS analysis of the extended products. Some reactions give rise to mixtures of partially extended products (&lt;8 nucleotide additions) due to low polymerase activity, while others lead to overextension (&gt;8 nucleotide additions). Overextension is significantly reduced when the EndoV is present in the reaction (Figure S4-6 &amp; S15). The peaks labelled in the UV spectra were assigned by MS analysis, additional peaks could not be assigned. The table provides the expected mass (Exp. mass), observed mass (Obs. mass) and corresponding number of nucleotide bases incorporated by the polymerase (Nt. additions).

Product and side-product masses were confirmed by mass spectrometry. T: template, *: phosphorothioate linkage, f: 2'-fluoro, m: 2'-methoxy, P: 5' phosphate group, HO/OH: 5'/3' hydroxyl group). Sequences printed in bold correspond to the correct product. Bases highlighted in red correspond to non-templated overextension. . Incubating a standard of the product in reaction buffer leads to 5'-dethiophosphorylation confirming that the side reaction is not enzyme catalysed. The target product contains a 5'-hydroxyl, so any remaining 5'thiphosphate groups were removed during the reaction work-up using an alkaline phosphatase.  </p></div>

The deconvoluted mass for each 18mer product (P) and the template (T) is provided in the tables. EndoV cleavage of the phosphorothioate modified oligonucleotide E2 provided the expected product (PA) and a 5'dethiophosphorylated product (PB). Incubating a PA standard (20 µM) in the reaction buffer at 70 °C leads to 5'-dephoshorylation confirming that the side reaction is not enzyme catalysed.</figDesc><graphic coords="34,97.52,72.00,402.72,516.85" type="bitmap" /></figure>

TnEndoV (2 µM) mediated cleavage of the enzymatically synthesized products (20 µM) was compared to the cleavage of the corresponding stereo-random oligonucleotides (20 µM). PAGE analysis shows A) Polymerase catalyzed extension of templates T1, and T12-T14 (lanes 3-6)(20 µM) proceeds to completion. Each template encodes an 18mer oligonucleotide product with a different nucleobase at the first position (1: ladder, 2: E/T/P standard). B) TnEndoV (2 µM) mediated cleavage of stereodefined oligonucleotides with Rp-linkages (lane 9-12) proceeds to completion, whilst the cleavage of the corresponding stereorandom oligonucleotides stalls at 50% conversion (lane 13-16).
