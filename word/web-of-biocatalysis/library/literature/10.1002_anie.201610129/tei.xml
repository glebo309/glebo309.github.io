<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Xenobiology (XB) aims to design biological systems endowed with unusual biochemistries, while enzymology concerns the study of enzymes, the workhorses of biocatalysis. Biocatalysis employs enzymes and organisms to perform useful biotransformations in synthetic chemistry and biotechnology. During the past years, the effects of incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into enzymes with potential applications in biocatalysis have been increasingly investigated. Here we provide an overview of the effects of new chemical functionalities that have been introduced into proteins to improve various facets of enzymatic catalysis. We also discuss future research avenues that will complement unnatural mutagenesis with the standard protein-engineering toolbox for producing novel and versatile biocatalysts with applications in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Biocatalysis and directed evolution</head><p>Humankind has traditionally used enzymes and microorganisms in common chemical biotransformations relevant to baking, brewing and other fermentation processes. Modern biocatalysis produces chemicals with high added values including medicines, vitamins, food ingredients, additives, biofuels, fragrances, polymers and many other useful products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Currently, biocatalysis has become a priority in the chemical industry. Its importance can be historically documented in three research waves, which are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[2]</ref> In the first wave, which dates back to more than a century ago, it became possible to scientifically articulate the fact that living organisms catalyze useful biotransformations, and subsequently apply whole cells and celluar extracts for the production of chemicals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[3]</ref> At this stage biocatalysts still suffered from a substrate scope limited to natural substrates. During the second wave (1970s-1980s), the first proteinengineering methods were developed, which enabled the overexpression and isolation of enzymes to better control both the quality and quantity of the biocatalyst. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">4]</ref> However, significant issues of enzyme stability and their limited substrate scopes especially towards nonnatural substrates were still a bottleneck. In the third and current wave (since the 1990s), which started with the pioneering work of Stemmer <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[5]</ref> , Arnold <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref> , Reetz <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[7]</ref> and Bornscheuer <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref> many of the previous problems have been solved by directed evolution. Directed evolution consists of iterative rounds of gene mutagenesis, followed by screening (or selection) where the generated enzyme mutants are evaluated based on their performance in model reactions. This method is commonly used to improve protein activity, binding, allostery, substrate scope, enantioselectivity and stability, among other properties. <ref type="bibr">[1a, 1g, 1h, 7, 9]</ref> Moreover, directed evolution along with computational chemistry enables the creation of de novo designed enzymes to access non-natural transformations including the Kempelimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref> , Diels-Alder <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11]</ref> and retro-Aldol <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref> reactions, which previously belonged exclusively to synthetic chemistry laboratories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref> Directed evolution is nowadays one of the most powerful approaches in protein engineering, yet it is limited to the 20 canonical amino acid (cAA) building blocks. In the past decade, the field of xenobiology (XB), and, in particular, the subfield of genetic-code reprogramming, has developed rapidly to allow the efficient introduction of hundreds of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) and prosthetic groups into protein structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref> In this regard, the fundamental question is whether proteins, particularly enzymes, remain functional or even have their catalytic properties improved with newly added chemistries such as unnatural cofactors and ncAAs. In this review, we summarise the advances in this research area and discuss the potential of unnatural building blocks in biocatalysis. The regio-and stereosectivity of the newly introduced hydroxylßgroups are marked in red on the presented structures. The first engineering wave started early in the last century when it was realized that whole-cell or cell lysates from organisms such as fungi could catalyze important chemical biotransformations like steroid hydroxylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[3]</ref> In the second wave, the rise of molecular biology and employment of tools in microbiology enabled a more precise control of protein function, as exemplified by the site-directed mutagenesis of a mouse CYP for the hydroxylation of steroids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[4]</ref> At the beginning of the third wave, control over stereo-and regioselectivity via directed evolution was achieved, as illustrated by the ISM-based CASTing of Cytochrome P450 derived from Bacillus megaterium (P450BM3) towards testosterone hydroxylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[15]</ref> Currently, the third wave is dedicated to the optimization of virtually any biocatalyst to fit the process specifications, as well as the creation of enzymes that do not exist in nature using de novo design and directed evolution.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Xenobiology with a focus on protein reprogramming</head><p>Nature uses a very limited set of chemicals when compared to the exceptionally rich and wide synthetic organic chemistry repertoire. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[19]</ref> This fact precludes a wide range of (bio)chemical transformations and their biotechnological applications. The emerging field of XB <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[20]</ref> aims to fill this gap by designing biological systems endowed with a chemistry absent in natural organisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[21]</ref> XB is highly diverse, with various emerging research directions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[22]</ref> The first direction encompasses the development of alternative nucleic acids (xenonucleic acids, XNAs) based upon new base pairs, sugars and backbones. A particular goal of this research is to provide different or additional letters to the existing genetic code <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[23]</ref> . <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[24]</ref> Another XB research direction is based on the concept of biocontainment, first proposed by Marliere and Herdewijn <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[25]</ref> and further elaborated by Schmidt, de Lorenzo and Budisa. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">26]</ref> Biocontainment implies that a synthetic organism can only survive in natural environments by using a human-supplied synthetic building blocks that has no biochemical source otherwise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[27]</ref> Ravikumar and Liu recently highlighted the latest studies on biocontainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[28]</ref> based on two recent reports by Church <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[29]</ref> and Isaacs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[30]</ref> . Similarly, Budisa and Süssmuth just reported an alternative approach towards biocontained cell factories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[31]</ref> These approaches are tightly bound to the third XB research direction, which aims to explore the impact of new chemical functionalities in proteins and proteomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[32]</ref> Organic chemistry can provide a great diversity of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) and unnatural cofactors that can be introduced into microorganisms as building blocks by experimental evolution. For example, E. coli was recently evolved to recruit thienopyrrole instead of indole and affords complete tryptophan substitution with thienopyrrole-alanine (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[33]</ref> in the genetic REVIEW code (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Fluorinated amino acids have been also used to engineer the proteomes of E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[34]</ref> and B. subtilis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[35]</ref> For a comprehensive analysis of these studies the reader is further referred to the contemporary literature. <ref type="bibr">[14a, 14c, 36]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>. Tryptophan has been recently substituted by thieno [3,2]pyrrolealanine in the E. coli proteome. All the developments in the third XB direction confronted us with the fundamental question whether proteins, in particular, enzymes, remain functional or even improve their catalytic properties with newly added chemistries such as unnatural cofactors and ncAAs. An analysis of this issue is provided later in section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">NcAAs</head><p>The incorporation of ncAAs into proteins has become a rich field of research that has contributed to a better understanding of many biological phenomena and processes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[37]</ref> The interdisciplinary nature of this research will enable the acceptance of a uniform terminology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr">38]</ref> NcAAs can be defined as amino acids that are not genetically encoded by natural living beings. For this reason, they are also known as non-proteinogenic <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[39]</ref> or unnatural amino acids. <ref type="bibr">[14b]</ref> However, the term noncanonical encompasses in a more general way all those amino acids of natural (terrestrial and extraterrestrial) or synthetic (i.e. man-made or anthropogenic) origin that are excluded from the canonical genetic-encoding mechanism. <ref type="bibr">[14e]</ref> NcAAs used in XB are ideally divided in two main classes: those structurally similar to cAAs are called analogues whereas those that highly differ from canonical structures are dubbed as surrogates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40]</ref> NcAAs enable the manipulation of protein structures with unprecedented precision at the single-atom level. Such "atomic mutations" (e.g. S→CH2 or H→OH) are easily performed when replacing a cAA by an analogue that differs only slightly in the side-chain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[41]</ref> Likewise, elements normally missing in cAA side chains can be substituted, for instance, Se in place of S or F (and the other halogens) in place of H, redox-sensitive groups and heavy atoms. <ref type="bibr">[14a, 42]</ref> In addition, new molecular fragments or electron withdrawing/donating substituents like nitro-(NO2) or methoxy-groups (OCH3) for tuning redox-reactions can be introduced. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[43]</ref> In particular, small-sized ncAAs prone to very rapid chemoselective reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref> are especially attractive as tags for various biological applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[45]</ref> Perhaps, the most simple and popular example is the terminal alkyne and organic azido pair that provides suitable bioorthogonal reactive handles for click-chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[46]</ref> This reaction enables screening for various specific protein-protein interactions as well as performing protein-immobilization or site-specific derivatization of proteins with synthetic moieties such as polyethylene glycol molecules, sugars, oligonucleotides or fluorophores. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[47]</ref> Furthermore, ncAAs containing UV-sensitive groups allow specific transformations such as controlled release of the functional moieties from so-called photo-cages, induction of interactions by photoreactive groups and conformational changes by photoswitches. <ref type="bibr">[14g, 48]</ref> In molecular and cellular biology, ncAAs have proven useful to study protein behavior with much higher accuracy than before. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[49]</ref> In particular, it is possible to study protein conformation by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[50]</ref> and to follow intracellular protein localization (using ncAAs as fluorophores) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[48]</ref> or to determine protein structures in vivo by means of 3D X-ray crystallography (using ncAAs carrying heavy atoms) or <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19</ref> F-NMR (using fluorine-labelled ncAAs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[51]</ref> This provides valuable chemical information that can be used to optimize or even uniquely redesign or stabilize biocatalysts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[52]</ref> However, it should always be kept in mind that the incorporation of ncAAs can alter the biophysical and biochemical properties of proteins such as pKa <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[53]</ref> , hygroscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[54]</ref> , polarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[55]</ref> , stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[56]</ref> and spectroscopic properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57]</ref> .</p><p>Proteins containing ncAAs are named alloproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[58]</ref> or xenoproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[59]</ref> (and allo-/xenoenzymes, accordingly). They are mainly produced by two different strategies, whose choice highly depends on the structure of ncAAs to incorporate. Indeed, current microbiological methods limit which of these can be incorporated. Both currently used methods are based on 'misacylation' of transfer RNA (tRNA) with ncAAs (see Scheme 1). One strategy exploits mischarged native tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) from the organisms chosen as protein expression hosts, whereas the other method relies on so-called 'orthogonal pairs' (o-pairs) composed of tRNAs and AARSs that suppress stop codons and usually originate from evolutionarily distant organisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[60]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">SPI: protein reprogramming using native tRNAs and AARSs</head><p>The simplest approach for incorporating ncAAs into proteins is via selective pressure incorporation (SPI). <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[61]</ref> Although the historical roots of this method date back to the 1950s (see early</p><p>10.1002/anie.201610129 Angewandte Chemie International Edition This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p><p>review by Richmond <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[62]</ref> ). it became popular after an early selenomethionine (Sem, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) incorporation experiment of Cowie and Cohen <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[63]</ref> , which was rediscovered by protein crystallographer W. A. Hendrickson in 1990's. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[64]</ref> Later, the potential of SPI in protein engineering was independently recognized by the Budisa <ref type="bibr">[14a]</ref> and Tirrell <ref type="bibr">[38b]</ref> labs (Scheme 1A).</p><p>Firstly, a bacterial culture is grown in minimal medium with a limited amount of the cAA to be replaced. After cAA depletion, the desired ncAA is added to the medium along with a specific inducer (e.g., IPTG) for overexpressing the target gene. Optimized fermentation and recombinant expression usually yield a high-level of cAA→ncAA substitution. <ref type="bibr">[38a]</ref> Of course, the microbial strain should not be able to produce the target cAA metabolically (akin to essential amino acids in humans), i.e., it should be an auxotrophic strain. SPI enables incorporation of analogues that are structurally similar to their cAA counterparts, because these must be up-taken by native cell-membrane transporters and processed in the protein translation machinery. Upon entering the cell, the endogenous AARS loads these ncAAs onto the "cognate" tRNA molecules. Consequently, the target cAA is globally replaced by the analogue during xenoprotein biosynthesis. Scheme 1. Methods for incorporating ncAAs into proteins. A) The selective pressure incorporation (SPI) method exploits the endogenous translational machinery to load ncAAs onto cognate tRNAs prior to protein overexpression. B) The stop codon suppression (SCS) approach endows the host with a new orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) and suppressor tRNA (AARS:tRNA sup ) pair (o-pair) to introduce a given ncAA at one or more locations in a target protein. The o-pair originates from natural sources and can be adjusted for the specific incorporation of the desired ncAA surrogate structure using positive and negative genetic selection procedures. <ref type="bibr">[42a]</ref> The SPI method is straightforward because it does not alter the native cellular translational components, rather, it exploits the relative promiscuity of AARSs <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[65]</ref> . For example, Szostak and coworkers found that more than 50 analogues can be enzymatically charged onto "cognate" tRNAs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[66]</ref> They concluded that ~70% of codons (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>) can be reassigned by exploiting the substrate tolerance of AARSs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[67]</ref> This so-called "poly-substrate specificity" is also a feature of many orthogonal AARSs (vide infra). <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[68]</ref> With SPI, multiple variants of the same protein can be produced by feeding the culture with different analogues. Because 30-40 sense codons are sufficient to encode the genetic information of an organism, a large number of sense codons (&gt;20) may be available for recoding with ncAAs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[69]</ref> Although this method can provide proteins containing analogues of virtually any cAA, the most dramatic effects (either favorable or detrimental) arise with substitution of cAAs that are critical for function and folding (e.g., Pro, Met, His or Trp).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">SCS: Protein reprogramming using orthogonal pairs</head><p>Due to its simplicity, SPI was initially the method of choice for producing xenoproteins, but the need for an alternative method to incorporate other ncAAs clearly emerged. Since the natural AARS:tRNA pairs discriminate between amino acids based on their structure, much effort was directed to develop novel AARS:tRNA pairs that could recognize ncAAs with structures very different from the 20 cAAs. Nature itself uses some amino acids outside of this set that can be genetically encoded into proteins, such as N-formylmethionine, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine (Sec and Pyl, respectively; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>Due to their rare appearance in proteins from specific organisms, Sec and Pyl are classified as special canonical amino acids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[58]</ref> Although, their decoding mechanisms are quite different <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[70]</ref> , these natural orthogonal incorporation systems can be taken as the starting points to engineer stop codon suppression (SCS, Scheme 1B). In the case of Pyl, for instance, the AARS and of the corresponding tRNA should be modified by creating AARS libraries in which the enzyme active site is engineered via directed evolution. By using genetic methods, a mutant enzyme that specifically recognizes a given ncAA structure can be isolated (black box, Scheme 1B). The novel AARS will thus not interfere with the translation of cAAs. The desired ncAA must be charged exclusively onto its cognate tRNA, whose anticodon has been ensured to correspond to a special codon (e.g., in E. coli the least used amber stop codon UAG). This approach would then create a site-specific incorporation of ncAA at the genetically predefined positions in the target sequence (e.g. an in-frame stop codon), in contrast to SPI where the replacement occurs in a residue specific manner.</p><p>The mutated tRNA is referred to as the suppressor tRNA (tRNAsup) and it should not act as a substrate for any of the 20 canonical AARSs. Therefore, the combination of an engineered AARS and its tRNAsup is what is called an orthogonal pair (opair). Not only the Pyl incorporation system, but also AARS:tRNA pairs of organisms evolutionary distant <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[71]</ref> from the expression hosts (i.e., from other domains of life) have been used as starting platforms for the directed evolution of new opairs. The most used systems for SCS in E. coli are the o-pairs derived from tyrosine of the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (TyrRS:tRNA Tyr ), pyrrolysine of the archaeon Methanosarcina species (PylRS:tRNA Pyl ) as well as phenylalanine of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PheRS:tRNA Phe ). <ref type="bibr">[14f]</ref> In recent years, numerous ncAAs have been site-specifically incorporated into proteins using a wide range of expression hosts including bacteria, yeasts, and mammalian cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[60]</ref> , and even multicellular organisms like the worm Caenorhabditis elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[72]</ref> and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. <ref type="bibr">[14d, 73]</ref> The engineering of orthogonal pairs based on Sec incorporating machinery appears to be far more complex and thus it still remains a challenge for contemporary research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[74]</ref> Both the SPI and the SCS methods have advantages and disadvantages, and these are summarized below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">SPI vs. SCS method</head><p>The existence of two methods in XB determines the limits for the set of ncAAs that can be ribosomally inserted into proteins. The choice of the method is not trivial and requires a number of considerations that should be taken into account:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1)</head><p>SPI employs native expression systems readily available in the organism, whereas SCS uses non-native o-pairs, which often require laborious optimization to achieve optimal specificity (usually via directed evolution).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2)</head><p>SPI allows the simultaneous incorporation of multiple ncAAs into the same protein. This number is limited only by the number of amino acid auxotrophies in the strain. <ref type="bibr">[53b]</ref> Proper metabolic configuration of the expression host is essential to achieve full ncAA labelling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[75]</ref> In the case of SCS, the current development of the method allows for one or a few ncAA structures to be incorporated into one protein sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[76]</ref> 3) SPI does not increase the amino acid alphabet size, thus one ncAA replaces one cAA. In contrast, in SCS the ncAAs are added to the 20 cAA repertoire. For this reason SCS is often referred to as genetic code expansion. <ref type="bibr">[14b]</ref> 4)</p><p>SPI performs global ncAA incorporation, i.e., it is not possible to choose target cAA positions for substitution; thus, it represents residue-specific incorporation. <ref type="bibr">[14a]</ref> Conversely, SCS allows the site-specific incorporation of ncAAs at virtually any position defined by insertion of a stop codon via mutagenesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[60]</ref> 5)</p><p>SPI is restricted to a pool of ncAAs that are similar to the initial cAAs (analogues). SCS allows for the incorporation of a variety of surrogates that are distinctly different from the 20 cAAs, but it is limited by the availability of suitable o-pairs and tolerance of the translation machinery components. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[76]</ref> 6) SPI requires strict fermentation conditions (time and medium composition), while there is no medium limitation for SCS. However, in this case the cell viability can be affected by the interference with some important stop codons in the genome. This as well as competition with release factors (RFs) for the stop codons and so-called "context effects" (vide infra) can lead to reduced protein yields with the SCS method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7)</head><p>Although, an auxotrophic strain is used in the SPI method, alternative metabolic sources of cAAs (e.g. protein recycling, salvage pathways) are not always excluded. This provides a source for the cAA contamination in the produced protein. In the SCS method, the source of heterogenicity is often presence of natural suppressors (Tyr, Gln, Leu, etc.).</p><p>Importantly, the SPI and SCS methods can be combined for the production of the very same xenoprotein. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[77]</ref> Such simultaneous substitution has been demonstrated, in particular by global replacement of Met/Pro using SPI <ref type="bibr">[53b]</ref> and Asp/Asn substitution with suitable amino acid surrogates via SCS on model proteins expressed in E. coli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[78]</ref> </p></div>

These strains were used to produce recombinant proteins containing single and multiple ncAAs via SCS method in higher yields. Yet the empirical observations suggest the existence of so-called mRNA "context effects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[83]</ref> in SCS. These are practically manifested as low yields of target proteins and truncated products even if the efficiency of ncAA incorporation is believed to be improved with RF-free engineered strains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[84]</ref> Recently Ignatova and others provided an experimental description and conceptual framework for understanding these phenomena. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[85]</ref> In other words, the insertion of a stop codon in a particular sequence can cause large deviations from natural mRNA folding and subsequently affect the binding site interaction strength within the ribosome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[86]</ref> These SCS issues could be remediated by applying computational design to the mRNA sequences. About a decade ago, Tirrell and co-workers proposed to use incorporation of ncAAs at rare sense codons <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[87]</ref> as an alternative to SCS. In this sense, we and others addressed the degeneracy of the genetic code and attempted to improve ncAA incorporation by emancipating rare sense codons from their prior coding roles and reprogramming them to permanently code for certain ncAAs. <ref type="bibr">[36f, 87a]</ref> Scheme 2. In vivo metabolic production of the ncAA Aha in E. coli. <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[88]</ref> One challenging task in SPI experiments is to achieve a high intracellular concentration of the ncAA and at the same time depletion of the proteinogenic cAA to be replaced, without compromising cell viability. Also, ncAA supply may become expensive as the xenoprotein expression process scales up. A solution to this issue comes from recent advances in metabolic 10.1002/anie.201610129 engineering.</p><p>For instance, Ma et al. engineered azidohomoalanine (Aha) production in a methionine (Met) auxotrophic E. coli strain by feeding it with O-acetyl-homoserine and inorganic azide for recombinant xenoprotein expression (Scheme 2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[88]</ref> Although chemical synthesis is still the main source of ncAAs, their market availability, price and purity are serious bottlenecks for industrial biotechnology. A more useful, broadly applicable chemical handle would be an ncAA that is intracellularly produced from low-cost chemical precursors added to the growth medium. For example, Exner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44]</ref> reported very recently an engineered PylRS varinat capable of activating and tRNA charging with S-allylcysteine (Sac) generated in situ from a cheap precursor allyl mercaptan, using the cysteine biosynthesis pathway.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Activity: turnover and catalytic efficiency</head><p>The first goal pursued by enzyme engineering with ncAAs was the improvement of catalytic properties on common model substrates. In many cases, catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM), turnover (kcat) and substrate affinity (KM) are defined by classical enzyme kinetics. <ref type="bibr">[91]</ref> Typically studied enzymes are lipases, which catalyze both the hydrolysis of esters and transacylation reactions, finding therefore a large variety of applications. <ref type="bibr">[92] [93]</ref> A systematic study using SPI-based engineering was conducted on a lipase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus (TTL) using polyauxotrophic E. coli strains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[94]</ref> Five different amino acids (Trp, Phe, Tyr, Met and Pro) were subjected to global replacement by ncAAs. These residues were chosen due to either their presence in the hydrophobic core (Trp, Phe, Met), or their involvement in peptide bond cis-trans isomerization (Pro), or their high concentration in either the substrate binding pocket (Phe, Tyr) or the lid domain that regulates the access of the substrate to the active site (Tyr, Met, Pro). Overall, the substitutions were expected to affect the protein fold and thus to change the temperature dependence of the enzyme activity. Indeed, one important feature of TTL is that the enzyme must be pre-incubated at elevated temperatures to shift its basal catalytic activity to the maximal catalytic activity. This process, known as heat activation, triggers a conformational rearrangement that opens the lid domain on top of the active site. The activity of the wild type (WT) and of the variant enzymes was measured via a spectrophotometric reaction with 4-nitrophenyl palmitate as the model substrate (Scheme 3). Scheme 3. Enzymatic hydrolysis of para-nitrophenyl palmitate used to characterize TTL reaction velocity. The production of para-nitrophenolate can be followed spectroscopically.</p><p>The fresh variants harboring para-and metafluorophenylalanine (pFF; mFF, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) exhibited already a high fraction of their maximal activity, whereas the WT was only weakly active before heat activation. Especially intriguing was the observation that, after activation, TTL[mFF] is 25% more active than the WT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[94]</ref> Another remarkable finding was that replacement of Met by its nonoxidizable analogue norleucine (Nle, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) resulted in a fully active variant without heat activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</p><p>The superfamily of cytochromes P450 (CYP) is another important class of biocatalysts, which catalyze the transfer of an oxygen atom from molecular oxygen (O2) to an organic substrate upon donation of electrons, in most cases obtained from external electron donors, e.g., coenzyme NAD(P)H (Scheme 4). <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">[95]</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>. Thermoanaerobacter thermohydrosulfuricus lipase (TTL), its lid domain (cyan) and the 11 Met residues substituted by Nle in the SPI experiment (black). The most prominent feature of the TTL[Nle] variant is a ten-fold higher activity in the absence of heat activation, whereas the WT lipase is almost inactive without thermal treatment. <ref type="bibr">[94a]</ref> CYPs can perform a wide range of reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[93]</ref> , thus finding applications in drug development, bioremediation and in the synthesis of fine chemicals, fragrances and other useful compounds. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">[96]</ref> Scheme 4. CYPs act primarily as monooxygenases. Here exemplified with hydroxylation of non-activated C-H bonds. Among all CYPs known, one of the most appealing for industrial applications is the one derived from Bacillus megaterium (P450BM3) because it possesses one of the highest known catalytic turnovers. P450BM3 has been engineered towards a broad range of substrates including alkanes, various drug scaffolds, terpenes and steroids. <ref type="bibr">[1g, 97]</ref> The groups of Arnold and Tirrell used SPI to replace Met by Nle in P450BM3 to test whether the enzyme stability was hampered by Met oxidation over the course of the reaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">[98]</ref> The peroxygenase activity of the resulting CYP variant was tested on the hydroxylation reaction of para-nitrophen-oxycarboxylate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Scheme 5); C12 of the substrate is specifically hydroxylated and paranitrophenolate is released, which has an absorption maximum at 398 nm. Although the variant P450BM3[Nle] does not show improved stability, but rather is more thermolabile than the Met parent, it exhibits an almost two-fold increase in catalytic activity compared to the WT enzyme.</p><p>Remarkably, Kolev et al. reported a P450BM3 variant that oxidizes (+)-nootkatone (Scheme 6) with the highest turnover number (kcat) reported to date for an engineered CYP on a complex molecule. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[99]</ref> This was achieved by substitution of Leu75 with para-aminophenylalanine (pAmF, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) by SCS in the active site of the enzyme, which resulted in a five-fold increase in the turnover number, whereby the product distribution (90% epoxide) remained the same. Scheme 6. Oxidation of (+)-nootkatone performed by P450BM3.</p><p>Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a detoxification enzyme that conjugates one molecule of glutathione to xenobiotic compounds in order to increase their hydrophilicity and thus facilitate their degradation. Parson et al. replaced four Trp residues of rat M1-1 GST (two located within the active site) by 5-fluorotryptophan (5FW, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) via SPI. As a result, a four-fold increase in kcat and a two-fold increase in kcat/KM was observed for the xenoproteins compared to the WT GST. <ref type="bibr">[89a]</ref> Dominguez et al. statistically replaced the four Phe residues of the restriction endonuclease PvuII with oFF, mFF and pFF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) using the SPI method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[100]</ref> PvuII cleaves DNA in correspondance of CAG|CTG sequences. The PvuII[oFF] and PvuII[pFF] variants had the same specific activity of the WT while PvuII[mFF] variant exhibited two-fold higher activity compared to the WT. Despite the fact that none of the exchanged Phe residues belonged to the active site, the effect on enzyme activity was caused by overall conformational differences between the final folded structures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[100]</ref> Transaminases catalyze the transfer of an amino group between amino acids and α-keto acids. They are appealing biocatalysts involved in the production of optically pure α-amines either through chiral resolution of cheap racemic amines or by asymmetric synthesis starting from prochiral ketones. <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[101]</ref> Deepankumar et al. globally replaced Tyr by metafluorotryrosine (mFY, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) in ω-transaminase (ω-TA) using the SPI method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[102]</ref> The resulting variant ω-TA[mFY] exhibited almost two-fold higher activity than the WT in the conversion of acetophenone into (S)-1-phenylethylamine (Scheme 7) in presence of 20% DMSO. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[102]</ref> Scheme 7. Transamination reaction performed by ω-TA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">[103]</ref> For better solubility of the reacting components the residual catalytic activity was monitored in the presence of 20 % DMSO. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[102]</ref> The Marx group engineered an N-terminally truncated version of DNA polymerase I from Thermus aquaticus (KlenTaq). DNA polymerase I catalyzes 5' → 3' DNA synthesis by selecting nucleotides complementary to the template DNA strand. It also performs proofreading of the newly synthesized DNA and is endowed with exonuclease activity in order to correct nucleotide mismatches. KlenTaq is a highly thermostable polymerase and has no nuclease activity. These two features make it particularly appealing for application in molecular biology. Global substitution of Met with trifluoromethionine (Tfm, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) was performed by SPI. The resulting variant retained almost the same activity as the WT at high temperatures (up to 70 °C). <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[104]</ref> In another study from the same group using the same method, the crucial Tyr671 in the KlenTaq enzyme was replaced by 2,3,5-trifluorotyrosine (F3Y, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). The substitution dramatically reduced the activity yet it revealed the importance of the pKa of the Tyr residue for H-bond interaction with the target DNA. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[105]</ref> E. coli nitroreductase (NTR) reduces the nitro group of various compounds. NTR is currently used as a local prodrug activator for cancer therapy, though it has the limitation of a high KM towards the substrate CB1954 (Scheme 8). Structural studies had suggested Phe124 could be critical for the establishment of a π-stacking interaction with the aryl ring of the CB1954 or with the NADH cofactor. Jackson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">[106]</ref> performed replacement of the Phe124 residue in the active site of this enzyme with cAAs (Tyr, Lys and Asp) and with several Phe analogues using the SCS method. The best variant contained para-nitrophenylalanine (pNF, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) and showed a more than 30-fold increase in kcat/KM compared to the WT, as well as a more than two-fold increase compared to the most active cAAbased mutant Phe124Lys. Notably, this suggested that πstacking may not be a critical interaction; otherwise the mutant Phe124Tyr should have been the most active. Moreover, substrate binding and catalytic activity was both improved, due to the dipole moment introduced into the ring by the nitro group of pNF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>REVIEW</head><p>Ugwumba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[107]</ref> studied substitution of the key Tyr309 of phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter (arPTE) via the SCS method. ArPTE hydrolyses organophosphates (e.g. pesticides) and the target residue was located in the substrate binding site. The arPTE variant containing L-(7hydroxycoumarin-4-yl)ethylglycine (HCEtG, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) in place of Tyr exhibited a 8-fold increase in kcat. The effect was found to be due to electrostatic repulsion between the HCEtG side chain and the product, which are both negatively charged.</p><p>The Schultz group scanned different positions for ncAA incorporation into TEM-1 β-lactamase by combining the SCS method and a library of aromatic amino acid surrogates. <ref type="bibr">[89e]</ref> Incorporation of para-acrylamido phenylalanine (pAcrF, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) in place of position Val216 of TEM-1 β-lactamase increased the kcat of cephalexin deactivation, eventually resulting in an eight-fold enhancement in the overall kcat/KM (Scheme 9). Heme peroxidases are able to perform a number of oxydative reactions; in particular, peroxidation of phenols can be performed by ascorbate peroxidase (APX, Scheme 10A). In this enzyme, the iron-heme complex is coordinated by a histidine side-chain, which is further held in place by an aspartate residue. Very recently Green et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[108]</ref> created a mutated APX, with Nmethyl histidine (Nmh) incorporated by SCS <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[109]</ref> in the place originally occupied by the heme-coordinating His163. The variant demonstrated higher catalytic efficiency and longer overall catalytic stability compared to the wild type. These results proved absence of any charge stabilization in the Asp-His fragment (scheme 10B). Clearly, Nmh represents a significant catalytic advantage in course of the repeated catalytic cycles, due to better electron-donative ability, fixed tautomeric state and charge of the imidazole ring. Since His-metal and His-Asp contacts appear frequently in numerous catalytic centers, the application of Nmh may become a key for creation of more active and stable enzymatic centers in the future.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Chemical and thermal stability</head><p>Lipases are widely used for reactions performed in organic solvents or in the presence of various additives. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[110]</ref> The hydrolytic residual activity of TTL variants obtained by Acevedo-Rocha et al. via SPI <ref type="bibr">[94b]</ref> was examined upon treatment with several organic solvents, metal ions, surfactants, inhibitors, protein reducing, alkylating and denaturing agents. Among the most remarkable effects, it was observed that TTL containing the Trp analogues 4-amino-, 4-fluoro, or 7-aza-Trp (4AmW, 4FW and 7AW, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) as well as the Met analogue Aha retained partial activity after treatment with 90% pyridine. The variants containing both enantiomers of the proline analogue 4fluoroproline (4SFP and 4RFP, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), performed much better than the WT and than any other variant upon 90% isooctane and tert-butanol treatment. Interestingly, all variants were more active than the WT in presence of tert-butanol with the exception of TTL [Aha].TTL containing (4R)-hydroxyproline (4RHP, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) exhibited almost 10-fold higher activity than the WT after incubation with the surfactant CHAPS. TTL[7AW] displayed about two-fold higher activity than the WT upon urea treatment. TTL[4AmW] and TTL[mFF] showed unprecedented resistance against the denaturant guanidinium chloride; additionally, TTL[4SFP] and TTL [mFY] were not inactivated by the protein inhibitor Pefabloc. <ref type="bibr">[94b]</ref> A mutant of Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB Asn74Asp) was engineered by globally replacing either Phe, Tyr or Trp residue with pFF, mFY and 5FW (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) via SPI. The three variants were less active than the WT but exhibited higher residual activity after several months of storage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[52]</ref> The aforementioned transaminase variant ω-TA[mFY] generated by Deepankumar et al. via SPI was more stable than the WT upon exposure to elevated temperatures (up to 70 °C) and cosolvents (e.g., up to 50% DMSO). <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[102]</ref> Later, the authors reported that the SCS-based incorporation of a single 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) residue into ω-TA in place of Arg23 allowed surfaceimmobilization and did not impair the stability. On the other hand, SPI incorporation of 4RFP in the same enzyme alone or in combination with site-specific DOPA incorporation dramatically increases the thermostability of the enzyme and enhanced its resistance towards organic solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[111]</ref> 10.1002/anie.201610129 REVIEW Othake et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[112]</ref> reported the incorporation of 3-chloro-and 3bromotyrosine (ClY and BrY, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) in the place of 7 Tyr residues in GST via SCS method. The GST[ClY] variant exhibited higher thermostability than the WT enzyme. This effect was initially thought to be due to a tighter packing of the protein core in the GST variant, since the halogenated analogues were bulkier than the original Tyr residues. In order to validate this hypothesis, single positions were mutated back to Tyr. Interestingly, the variants containing 6 halogenated positions but having Tyr at the buried position 155 exhibit further improvement of the thermostability, thus suggesting that not all sites were equally permissible to substitution. In the specific case of position 155, residues bulkier than Tyr lead to steric clashes with the surrounding protein environment. Removal of bromination at position 155 elicited heat resistance. Subsequently, both chlorination and bromination at Tyr32 were observed to have an exceptionally favourable effect on thermostability.</p><p>According to the previous observations, two new variants were produced with 7 positions halogenated (32 included, 155 excluded). These two new variants recovered specific activity at room temperature (from 60 to 72% of the WT activity in the case of the chlorinated variant and from 47 to 60% for the brominated one), exhibited improved heat resistance (from 11% to 79% residual activity in the case of the chlorinated variant and from 0 to 71% for the brominated one) and 20% increase in stability against chemical denaturation compared to the WT. When examining the three major stabilizing positions (32, 57 and 73) in crystal structures of these variants, it was observed that the halogenated side chains established synergic interaction networks bridged by canonical side chains. In particular, the analogue at position 32 and Tyr56 form a hydrogen bond between their hydroxyl groups, while the analogues at positions 57 and 73 are connected via Asp59. They both form an electrostatic interaction between the hydrogen of their hydroxyl groups and the carboxylic group of Asp, strengthened by halogenation. Since Tyr-side chains are quite abundant in industrially relevant enzymes such as oxidoreductases or in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies, Othake et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[112]</ref> proposed selective bulky halogenation of Tyr positions as a strategy to improve biocatalysts stability. Indeed, these modifications extend the half-life of E. coli azoreductase by 13-fold after heat exposure and cause 2.0 kcal/mol increase in ΔG(H2O). Azoreductases catalyse the reduction of azo groups utilizing NAD(P)H as electron donor and represent enzymes of industrial interest because by reductive cleavage of azo bonds they can decolorize azo dyes into corresponding aromatic amines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[113]</ref> Gilles et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[114]</ref> globally replaced Met with Nle in E. coli adenylate kinase (ADK) via SPI. ADK is a phosphotransferase enzyme involved in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism (Scheme 11). ADK[Nle] exhibited a significant increase in resistance against inactivation by hydrogen peroxide in comparison to the WT, while preserving structure and catalytic activity. This classical example validated the logic of Met-to-Nle replacement, where the side-chain containing the thioether group, prone to be oxidized to sulfoxide or even to sulfone <ref type="bibr">[55a]</ref> , is replaced by a structurally similar aliphatic analogue. In a similar approach, Snider et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[115]</ref> replaced Cys490 by Sec in the redox center of thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster (DmTR). TR provides electrons for the reduction of disulfide bridges in proteins via thioredoxin. This study was inspired by the observation that the orthologous mammalian TR containing Sec is more stable against a broad range of oxidants than DmTR. Indeed, DmTR[Sec] exhibits higher activity than the Cys-containing WT after incubation with various oxidants. This observation appears to contradict the fact that Sec is not resistant to oxidation, in fact it is more oxidation-prone than Cys because of the higher polarizability of the selenium atom compared to sulfur.

CAT is responsible for inactivation of the antibiotic chloramphenicol, via acetylation (Scheme 13). The variant CAT13[Tfl] was less stable than the WT but only two rounds of random mutagenesis and screening identified a new variant containing 3 Tfl substitutions, which exhibited better thermostability than the WT enzyme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[122]</ref> A loss in stability is quite often experienced when many ncAAs are incorporated into a target protein. Nevertheless, Nagasundarapandian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[123]</ref> designed protein structures that are not perturbed by the incorporation of ncAAs. They chose the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a model protein, created mutants with increased refoldability and engineered them with the Met analogues Aha, Nle, homopropargylglycine, ethionine and methoxinine (Hpg, Eth, Mox respectively) by SPI. While the variants with GFP native structure were barely fluorescent, those with optimized structures indeed fully restored fluorescence to the level of the WT protein.</p></div>

For this reason, incorporation of ncAAs might affect more enzymatic properties at the same time. It is not rare that upon incorporation of ncAAs that modify activity or stability, also changes in substrate scope, enantio-and stereoselectivity arise.</p><p>In the systematic SPI study reported by Hoesl et al. using TTL, among the 13 variants produced, TTL[mFF] exhibited a broader substrate range than the WT enzyme (C6-C10), being active on triglycerides with both long and short fatty acid chains (C2-C18). <ref type="bibr">[94a]</ref> The ω-TA[mFY] described by Deepankumar et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">[102]</ref> did not differ from the parent enzyme in terms of substrate specificity or enantioselectivity. However, it additionally performed the complete conversion of acetophenone into the chiral amine (S)-1-phenylethylamine, whereas the WT achieved only ~70% substrate conversion (Scheme 7, section 3.1). Kolev et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[99]</ref> tested the incorporation by SCS of 4 ncAAs (paraaminophenylalanine, para-acetylphenylalanine, O-benzyltyrosine and 3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, pAmF, pAcF, OBnY, 2Nal, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) at 11 positions within the active site of a CYP in order to change the regioselectivity for the hydroxylation of (+)-nootkatone (Scheme 6, section 3.1) and (S)-ibuprofen methyl ester (Scheme 14).</p></div>

Hydroxylation reaction performed by CYP on (S)-ibuprofen methyl ester.</head><p>The WT CYP oxidizes a broad range of substrates but has poor selectivity towards the substrate (S)-ibuprofen methyl ester, giving a mixture of products hydroxylated at C1´ and C2´. Conversely, the variants with pAcF in place ofAla78 and 2Nal in place of Ala328 exhibited highly regioselective hydroxylation at C1´ (88%) and C2´ (95%) sites, (in contrast to 62% and 38% of the WT, respectively. Scheme 14). Similarly, the variant with pAcF in place of Ala82 has much higher regioselectivity than the WT for oxidation at position C13´ of (+)-nootkatone (62% vs 4%, Scheme 6). <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[99]</ref> Notably, the CYP variant with pAcF in place of Ala78 performs also the unprecedented oxidation of (+)nootkatone at position C9´ (73% in contrast to 0% of WT, Scheme 6). These results are unmatched by any mutant containing any of the 20 cAAs, thus demonstrating that the sitespecific incorporation of ncAAs into the active site of an enzyme can provide unprecedented solutions to increase the selectivity of catalytic reactions. Diketoreductase (DKR) catalyzes the stereoselective reduction of ketones to chiral alcohols and represents a biocatalyst of industrial interest for the synthesis of active pharmaceutical compounds. Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[124]</ref> demonstrated that Trp222 plays a gatekeeper role, regulating the access of the substrate to the active site of DKR. In order to investigate whether the size of residue 222 influenced substrate enantiotope preference, they incorporated 4 surrogates at that critical position by SCS. The chosen ncAAs para-methoxyphenylalanine, paraphenylphenylalanine, para-cyanophenylalanine and O-tertbutyltyrosine (pMeOF, BiF, pCNF and pBu t OF, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) had increasing molecular volume of the side chain in the order pCNF&lt;Trp&lt;pMeOF &lt;BiF&lt;pBu t OF. The xenoproteins reduced the substrate 2-chloro-1-phenylethanone, giving different enantiomeric mixtures of alcohol products. The WT DKR exhibited rather small enantiomeric excess (ee), whereas the variants with increased bulkiness DKR[pMeOF], DKR [BiF]  and DKR[pBu t OF] exhibited higher ee up to 34 with retention of Ma et al. conclusively demonstrated that incorporating ncAAs bulkier than Trp at gatekeeper position 222 drives substrate preference of DKR to the (R) enantiomer, while incorporating smaller ncAAs turns the preference towards the (S) enantiomer. The reason was found in the orientation assumed by the substrate when entering the active site. Trp and bulkier residues induce reduction of 2-chloro-1-phenylethanone with Re-face preference, while in the case of pCNF, Si-face is preferred. <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[124]</ref> Doubtless, it will be interesting to test whether other smaller or larger cAA could outperform any of the ncAAs employed.</p></div>

The attachment proceeded via affinity adsorption, as DOPA-rich proteins are known to exhibit good affinities to inorganic surfaces due to catechol coordination to metal ions, metal oxides, borates and silicates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[128]</ref> A further development of the method implies the use of ncAAs with bioorthogonal reactive side chains. This is a very powerful tool in protein engineering <ref type="bibr">[14f, 129]</ref> because it enables specific bioconjugation reactions via click-chemistry, i.e., copper(I)catalyzed azide-alkyne Huisgen cyloaddition (CuAAC). <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[130]</ref> CuAAC has all the necessary features of an ideal click reaction: it is specific, rapid, and compatible with an aqueous environment while offering in a simple set-up high product yields without appreciable side products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[131]</ref> Clickable residues provide a great advantage in the immobilization of biocatalysts on solid surfaces because they allow to control which part of the enzyme is directed toward the support and which part is exposed to the reaction solution (Scheme 17A). Catalysis can consequently benefit from a better exposure of the active site. Also, covalent immobilization offers better control of the protein density on the surface. Usually, ncAAs containing azide functions such as para-azidophenylalanine (pAF, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) or Aha are incorporated in the target enzyme via SPI or SCS and are then incubated with surfaces endowed with complementary alkyne functionalities. Alkyne-bearing ncAAs such as para-propargyloxyphenylalanine or homopropargylglycine (pPOFand HpG, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) can also serve for functionalization on azide functionalized surfaces.</p><p>Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[132]</ref> site-specifically incorporated pPOF at 6 different positions in T4 lysozyme via SCS in a cell-free expression system and subsequently immobilized the variant on superparamagnetic beads via CuAAC.

Its natural function is binding DNA but the de novo designed active site enables LmrR to take part in catalysis. In particular, the engineered LmrR served as a scaffold to bind Cu 2+ ions and enable an asymmetric vinylogous Friedel-Crafts alkylation (Scheme 20B). However, the engineered LmrR forms the product shown in Scheme 20 without enantiomeric excess. The incorporation of BpyA via SCS into the engineered LmrR allowed forming the product in enantiomeric excess. The LmrR variant with BpyA at position 89 gave the (+)-enantiomer as product, while the variant with BpyA at position 93 formed the (-)-enantiomer in excess (Scheme 21). Thus, it can be assumed that the different locations of the metal ion ligand BpyA in LmrR create different chiral microenvironments for the catalytic reaction, which lead to a change in the enzyme enantioselectivity. This example demonstrates that the protein environment plays a crucial role in regulating the catalytic properties of metalloenzymes. In cases where sequence-function correlations are difficult to explain, ncAAs can be used to investigate the role of particular conserved residues. For example, Berry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[162]</ref> replaced the equatorial ligand Cys112 in the copper center of azurine, by selenocysteine (Sec, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Azurine is a bacterial protein involved in electron-transfer reactions and the artificial Se-bearing variant exhibited a prominent change in the spectroscopic features when compared to the WT.

These results demonstrate the importance of the cross-linked Tyr-His ligand for the selective reduction of O2 to water. Similar to the above-mentioned investigations, Zhou et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[166]</ref> used Mb as a model to probe the Tyr-Cys cross-link in Thioalkalivibrio nitratireducens cyt c nitrite reductase (TvNiR) that catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia  The groups of Lu and Wang <ref type="bibr">[158c, 167]</ref> chose Mb[Phe33Tyr] as a model to study the role of Tyr in cyt c oxidase (CcO), the last enzyme of the cellular respiratory chain catalysing O2 reduction to water. They created Mb[Phe33Tyr] variants by incorporating the halogenated tyrosine analogues 3-chlorotyrosine, 3,5difluorotyrosine (ClY and F2Y, respectively, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) and F3Y via SCS method. These ncAAs were chosen because the pKa of the phenol ring in their side chains is lower than that of Tyr, in the order Tyr&gt;ClY&gt;F2Y&gt;F3Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">[167]</ref> Among the resulting variants, the most active was Mb[Tyr33F3Y], improving the WT activity by about 2-fold. Lowering the pKa for Tyr33 increases the protondonating ability and this leads to higher oxidase activity and selectivity towards water production. This was in agreement with the previous hypothesis that Tyr33 was donating protons for the substrate O-O bond cleavage. In a following study <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">[168]</ref> , the same residue Tyr33 was further substituted with 3-methoxytyrosine (MeOY, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) via SCS method. MeOY has a similar pKa compared to Tyr but a much lower reduction potential. Expectedly, the variant Mb[Tyr33MeOY] displayed a higher oxidase activity than Mb[Phe33Tyr].

Mono-, di-and tri-fluorinated Tyr-analogs (FnY) were incorporated by SCS method in RNR in place of Tyr356 and enabled elucidation of the role of tyrosyl radicals in mechanism and reactivity of this enzyme via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b175">[169]</ref> Similarly, Phe365 and Phe605 were replaced with fluorinated mono-, diand tri-fluorinated Phe analogs (FnF) (as electron poor) and pMeOF (as electron enriched, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) as counterparts for cationπ interaction in the active portion of squalene hopene cyclase (SHC) from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius. SHC catalyses the polycyclization of linear molecules of squalene to polycyclic triterpene and its activity was expected to proportionally correlate to the strength of the cation-π interaction. Indeed, the reaction rates decreased by increasing the number of fluorination substituions in the FnF variants while the pMeOF variants showed higher reaction rates than the WT at temperatures below 40 °C. These observations demonstrated for the first time that the cation-π interaction is involved in stabilization of triterpene biosynthetic intermediates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[170]</ref> Clearly, orthogonal translation with various metal-binding ncAAs can lead to new xeno/metallo binding sites. <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[171]</ref> These novel metal binding sites allow the binding of alternative transition metals or alternative metal cofactors, the reactivity of which is regulated by the protein scaffold. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[172]</ref> In an ideal case, artificial metalloenzymes should be capable of incorporating a transition metal obtained from the cellular environment. In this regard protein scaffolds with bidentate metal binding amino acids like bipyridylalanine <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">[173]</ref> or DOPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">[174]</ref> have proved to be very useful tools to improve the scope and control of coordination chemistry of various metal ion/metal cofactor binding centers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">What are the future directions in biocatalysis?</head><p>Modern biocatalytic processes can substantially profit from the above mentioned developments. Doubtless, directed evolution has proven extremely powerful in providing more stable and selective biocatalysts, and in endowing natural enzymes with specific catalytic features, although being limited to the 20 cAA building blocks provided by natural protein expression systems. However, XB and in particular protein reprogramming with ncAA offers innovative solutions for protein engineering and should complement directed evolution approaches in the future.</p><p>The examples selected in this work show that, upon ncAA incorporation, a single or few protein expression experiments are already sufficient to obtain variants with improved features in comparison to the native enzymes. In contrast, directed evolution experiments usually involve screening hundreds or thousands of variants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b181">[175]</ref> Moreover, the introduction of new chemical functionalities into proteins offers unprecedented opportunities to expand their properties beyond the 20 cAAs. For example, no natural amino acid was able to outperform the ncAAs in terms of activity and selectivity for the CYP-based hydroxylation of an ibuprofen-derivative (Scheme 14). <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[99]</ref> Similarly, TEM-1 β-lactamase mutants containing cAA could not match the activity of a variant harbouring a ncAA. <ref type="bibr">[89e]</ref> Nevertheless, discouraging is the fact that the main achievements have mainly been demonstrated with Phe, Tyr, Pro, Met and Trp non-canonical substitutes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Of particular interest for the generation of new enzymes might be to replace histidine residues, which are often essential in biological catalysis. Recent excellent example of replacement of His with Nmh <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">[108]</ref> seems to be very encouraging (see Scheme 10B). Even methylation of imidayole side chain can change the features of His such as 1) electron donative properties, 2) ability for a proton abstraction, 3) involvement into hydrogen bond networks, 4) steric packing in active sites of enzymes. Of further attention, would be to tune the acid-base transition properties of His. Indeed, the imidazole side chain seems to be optimized for various chemical transformations at physiological pH, due to its close to neutral pKa. It is also well-known that imidazole is not interchangeable with other naturally occurring heterocycles, thiazole and oxazole, without adverse effects on enzyme activity due to different basicity values (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">9A</ref>). By far, some His analogues with altered pKa profiles (e.g. 1,2,4-triazole-3-alanine, 4-fluorohistidine and 2-fluorohistidine) have been incorporated into proteins by SPI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">[176]</ref> Recently, Schultz an co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[109]</ref> evolved a PylRS-based amber suppressor o-pair for a series of histidine analogues in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells (such as the ones shown on Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">9B</ref>). Subsequently His66 in the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) was substituted with these histidine analogues giving rise to variants with unique 10.1002/anie.201610129 REVIEW spectroscopic features. We foresee that engineering histidine side chains will soon contribute to a better understanding of the role of imidazole heterocycle in catalytic transformations and could yield a convenient strategy to improve enzymatic activity, as well as change the pH profiles of the existing biocatalysts. The two strategies for incorporation of ncAAs, SPI and SCS, provide a means to substitute canonical residues by structurally similar (analogues) or dissimilar (surrogates) noncanonical ones. Combining SPI and SCS might as well become a strong approach for the development of new biocatalysts. For example, Hoesl and Budisa demonstrated that in TTL it was indeed possible to combine an increase in enzyme activity achieved by global Nle incorporation with site-specific incorporation of the photo-crosslinking amino acid para-benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa). <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[77]</ref> Similarly, variants with elevated enzyme activity could be endowed with bioorthogonal conjugation groups to perform immobilization via click chemistry. Likewise, Deepankumar et al. combined SPI and SCS to render a more stable ω-TA that could be additionally immobilized to chitosan and polystyrene for multiple reaction cycles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[111]</ref> Global ncAA incorporation by SPI requires only a single expression experiment that can be quickly performed. The bottleneck of the SPI method is the bioavailability of the ncAAs for target protein expression. To assure sufficient intracellular concentrations, the ncAA analogues are supplied in excess in the culture and this may become expensive, in particular for scale-up fermentations. However, this issue was recently addressed by engineering the expression host with metabolic pathways for the intracellular production of ncAAs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">88]</ref> Similarly, E. coli strains have been engineered for the SCS production of proteins containing Tyr <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">[177]</ref> , Phe <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">[178]</ref> and Pyl <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[179]</ref> analogues. Doubtless, an expanded genetic code in combination with metabolic engineering would further diversify the chemical arsenal for the large-scale production of useful xenoproteins, which are today still the exclusive domain of proof-of-principle experiments.</p><p>On the other hand, the main issue limiting SCS application is probably the low incorporation efficiency depending on the target site. This point has been addressed by directed evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[76]</ref> In one of the first studies, Baldwin et al. identified multiple permissive sites for ncAA incorporation into a protein by randomly inserting stop codons along the gene sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[180]</ref> In another work, Cropp and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b187">[181]</ref> tested the incorporation of a single ncAA at different positions along a target protein sequence by creating a library of mutants, containing one in-frame amber stop codon each. This method took the name of Scanning Unnatural Amino Acids Mutagenesis (SUAAM). Shortly after, the group extended the method by allowing the inframe mutation of one, two or three consecutive codons for Multicodon Scanning Mutagenesis (MSM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">[182]</ref> However, all the aforementioned methods do not allow the controlled insertion of TAG codons, which can render the library creation timeexpensive. To circumvent these drawbacks, Magliery and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[183]</ref> developed a Stop Codon Scanning Mutagenesis (SCSM) method that allows the specific insertion of in-frame stop codons during DNA synthesis by using protected nucleotide phosphoramidites. The method was successfully applied to incorporate Bpa into a model protein.</p><p>The Schultz lab also combined SCS with directed evolution in the form of saturation mutagenesis to optimize antibodies containing sulfotyrosine (STyr, SY), with binding affinities higher than those conferred by the 20 cAAs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[184]</ref> All these examples clearly illustrate how the combination of directed evolution and genetic-code engineering will further increase the chemical functionality of proteins and enzymes, thus complementing the standard cAA based with an ncAA based protein-engineering toolbox (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Summary and Outlook</head><p>Importantly, XB complements directed evolution because ncAAbased protein engineering aims to provide unnatural building blocks and cofactors whose chemistry could offer advantages not conferred by the twenty cAAs for applications in biocatalysis and beyond. For example, various ncAAs with electron rich aromatic side chains such as aniline, aminophenol, catechols, azidophenols which are especially useful in oxidative couplings of enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[185]</ref> or in enzyme catalysis where aromatic πelectrons play an essential role <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[186]</ref> can be introduced directly using both SCS and SPI. A diverse toolkit of ncAAs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) has been developed offering unique functionalities such as photoswitches, novel spectroscopic probes, moieties capable of orthogonal chemical reactivity, redox activity, and metal ion binding or novel steric properties. The corresponding methodologies for incorporation of maximal ncAA numbers in maximal combinations are also provided at least for the overexpression of biocatalysts in common workhorses such as E. coli (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). This toolkit will be very useful in increasing our understanding of how protein architecture imposes specific electrostatic fields onto bound substrates, i.e., to quantify their magnitude and catalytic effects (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8</ref>). NcAAs with physicochemical properties different from those of the native residues not only provide insights into enzyme activity and stability, but also improve these features by adding unconventional moieties at key positions. Additionally, the employment of ncAAs will also allow very efficient and controllable conjugation of enzymes on solid supports as well as the introduction of unnatural metal cofactors (Scheme 17 and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref>). Nonetheless, further development of innovative methodologies for library design, screening, genetic selection and metabolic engineering are necessary to enable a wider use of ncAAs. Only with cheap and reproducible technology at hand we will be able to explore whether ncAAs can create more active, specific, stable and chemically functionalised enzymes by expanding the amino acid pool beyond the 20 cAAs. These efforts will also 10.1002/anie.201610129 provide deeper insights into protein evolution. We expect that further efforts in XB will notably increase the application of unnatural building blocks in biocatalysis.</p></div>
