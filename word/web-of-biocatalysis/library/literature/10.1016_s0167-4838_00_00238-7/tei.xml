<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Previously, sequence comparisons between a mesophilic enzyme and a more thermostable homologue were shown to be a feasible approach to successfully predict thermostabilizing amino acid substitutions. The `consensus approach' described in the present paper shows that even a set of amino acid sequences of homologous, mesophilic enzymes contains sufficient information to allow rapid design of a thermostabilized, fully functional variant of this family of enzymes. A sequence alignment of homologous fungal phytases was used to calculate a consensus phytase amino acid sequence. Upon construction of the synthetic gene, recombinant expression and purification, the first phytase obtained, termed consensus phytase-1, displayed an unfolding temperature (T m ) of 78.0³C which is 15^22³C higher than the T m values of all parent phytases used in its design. Refinement of the approach, combined with site-directed mutagenesis experiments, yielded optimized consensus phytases with T m values of up to 90.4³C. These increases in T m are due to the combination of multiple amino acid exchanges which are distributed over the entire sequence of the protein and mainly affect surface-exposed residues; each individual substitution has a rather small thermostabilizing effect only. Remarkably, in spite of the pronounced increase in thermostability, catalytic activity at 37³C is not compromised. Thus, the design of consensus proteins is a potentially powerful and novel alternative to directed evolution and to a series of rational approaches for thermostability engineering of enzymes and other proteins.</p></div>

In order to escape from this dilemma, the combination of random mutagenesis with high throughput screening technologies (`directed evolution') is increasingly used to further optimize proteins. An important aspect of directed evolution is the in vitro or in vivo (re)combination (`shu¥ing') of bene¢cial mutations. Di¡erent techniques have been developed to (re)combine single mutations or entire families of homologous genes [1^8] and have proven to be powerful tools to expand the sequence space that is available for screening. Still, these screening-based methods have the disadvantage to strongly depend on fast and reliable screening assays which are not always available or not even conceivable, and to require sophisticated and expensive equipment.</p><p>This short review describes a new, complementary and potentially powerful tool for increasing the thermostability of proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Rational concepts for thermostability engineering</head><p>Increasing the thermostability of an enzyme usually requires the combination of multiple amino acid exchanges, each of which slightly increases the unfolding temperature of the protein. The critical and di¤cult task in this endeavor is the identi¢cation of stabilizing amino acid replacements. Although in principle the forces responsible for proper folding and stabilization of a protein are known, no reliable procedures are currently available to rapidly identify ^by rational means ^amino acid exchanges that increase the thermostability of a given protein.</p><p>The rational approaches for thermostability engineering can be grouped in two main classes: (A) comparison of the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest with that of a more thermostable, homologous counterpart, followed by replacement of selected amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis; and (B) detailed inspection of the 3D structure of the protein of interest, structure-based prediction of promising amino acid exchanges by applying current concepts of thermostability engineering, and subsequent veri¢cation as single mutations in the wildtype protein. The latter thermostabilization concepts include, among others, the introduction of additional disul¢de bridges, improvements in the packing of the hydrophobic core, engineering of surface salt bridge networks or K-helix dipole interactions, changes in Khelix propensity, and changes in entropy (e.g. X-to-Pro or Gly-to-Ala substitutions [9^15]). All these rational approaches have been used successfully in the past, but the chance of success is not easily predictable. The latter unpredictability may be due to the fact that amino acid substitutions may exert their e¡ects not only locally, on their immediate neighbors, but may actually transduce conformational changes over signi¢cant distances in a protein. Evidence for such long range e¡ects has been collected for a thermostabilized p-nitrobenzyl esterase obtained by directed evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, on the basis of which the authors concluded that `even given a high resolution crystal structure, it is unlikely that the mutations discovered in the experiments could have been predicted'. Therefore, rational approaches of the above kind will likely become more reliable only with more powerful algorithms that are able to take long range e¡ects into account.</p><p>Barnase and binase are 110 amino acid ribonucleases that share 85% amino acid sequence identity. Serrano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> tested ^by site-directed mutagenesis of barnase ^the impact of all 17 amino acid di¡erences between barnase and binase on the stability of the protein and observed e¡ects between +1.1 and 31.1 kcal mol 31 . A multiple mutant combining six substitutions displayed a stability increase of 3.3 kcal mol 31 over the wild-type enzyme. The data therefore indicated that sequence comparisons between (closely) homologous mesophilic enzymes may contain useful information for increasing the protein's thermostability.</p><p>This conclusion is corroborated by the work of Steipe and co-workers [18^21] who, however, used a di¡erent approach. They predicted stabilizing substitutions based on a comparison of the frequency of occurrence of amino acids in sequences of immunoglobulin variable V L and V H domains. Their work was based on the hypothesis that the immunoglobulin repertoire approximates a canonical ensemble of sequences, each derived from one of a set of germ line sequences and selected in a process of random, independent mutations. They also postulated that destabilizing random mutations are highly probable, but are selectively neutral as long as the overall domain stability does not fall below a certain threshold. Conversely, random mutations resulting in increased thermostability are highly improbable in the absence of a positive selection. Consequently, they assumed that the most frequent amino acid at any position in an alignment of homologous immunoglobulin variable V L or V H domains contributes more to the stability of the domain than an amino acid that only occurs once. They calculated a statistical `free energy' from the frequencies of occurrence and predicted ten stabilizing mutations for the immunoglobulin variable V U domain, of which six were indeed stabilizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">The consensus concept applied to entire proteins: phytase as a test case</head><p>Every amino acid of a protein contributes to some extent to its overall stability. Consequently, it would be of advantage to `optimize' a considerable number of residues concomitantly in a one-step procedure, or to apply a reliable concept over the entire sequence and/or structure of a protein of interest. With the rational and random thermostabilization approaches discussed in Sections 1 and 2, usually one or a few substitutions only are tested at a time. The thermostabilizing mutations thus identi¢ed, which usually have a small e¡ect on the protein's stability, are then (re)combined in a variant that is distinguished by a more pronounced increase in thermostability.</p><p>The hesitance up to the present day to change more than one or even multiple amino acids at a time may be based on the following arguments: (a) none of the rational concepts has a 100% success rate for predicting thermostabilizing mutations. Therefore, if any concept were applied over the entire sequence of a protein, also destabilizing mutations would be introduced. (b) Likewise, every amino acid forms a delicate network of multiple interactions with its neighbors. Consequently, there is a high risk of introducing deleterious interactions (e.g., steric or charge repulsions) when changing multiple residues along the entire sequence of the protein. As a matter of fact, at least for random mutagenesis, (substantially) destabilizing mutations seem to be much more prevalent than stabilizing ones (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>). (c) The above concepts speci¢cally address thermostability independently of catalytic activity which raises the concern that application of any one of those concepts throughout the entire sequence of a protein may compromise or even destroy its enzymatic activity. Incidentally, Steipe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> initially applied their consensus concept only to an immunoglobulin V U domain lacking catalytic activity. Surprisingly, we succeeded in overcoming these prejudices and obtained thermostable enzymes by construction of the respective consensus proteins containing, at every position of the amino acid sequence, the `consensus amino acid' calculated from an alignment of homologous amino acid sequences by an appropriate computer program (see below). Our model enzyme was phytase, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.8), which catalyzes phosphomonoester cleavage of phytic acid, the major storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. Since phytic acid phosphorus is largely unavailable to monogastric animals like pigs or poultry, supplementation of the feed with phytase increases the dietary availability of phosphorus, thereby reduces the need for inorganic phosphate supplements and, thus, helps to protect the environment.</p><p>In a ¢rst attempt <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, 13 homologous amino acid sequences of wild-type phytases from mesophilic fungi were aligned with the program PILEUP from the GCG sequence analysis software package <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The consensus sequence of the aligned phytases was then Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>. `Evolution' of the consensus phytases. For a detailed description and for the exact mutations, see the text and Lehmann et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. calculated with the program PRETTY using a set of appropriately de¢ned parameters. A stretch of the sequence alignment together with the corresponding stretch of consensus phytase-1 is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Out of 441 positions, 423 were de¢ned by the program, whereas 18 were or had to be selected arbitrarily. In contrast to methods that deliberately choose the `optimized new amino acid' from all 19 alternative amino acids, the consensus concept selects, at every position in the sequence, an amino acid that already has proven its ¢tness in the structure of at least one of the homologous enzymes used in the alignment.</p><p>The amino acid sequence of consensus phytase-1 was back-translated into a DNA sequence on the basis of the codon frequency table of highly expressed Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, and the consensus phytase gene generated subsequently using the method of extensive overlap extension by PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Surprisingly, consensus phytase-1 was 15^26³C more thermostable than all parent phytases used in its design when analyzed by di¡erential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>) or temperature-activity pro¢les <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In a second step <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the consensus approach was re¢ned by including six more sequences in the alignment, and by calculating two more consensus amino acid sequences (consensus phytases-10 and -11; see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Remarkably, consensus phytase-10 again displayed a 7.4³C increase in unfolding temperature, T m , relative to consensus phytase-1 (85.4 vs. 78.0³C). In order to identify which of the 38 residues di¡ering between consensus phytase-1 on one hand and consensus phytases-10 and -11 on the other hand have an impact on the thermostability of the protein, most of the substitutions were tested individually by site-directed mutagenesis of consensus phytase-1. These experiments con¢rmed that: (a) a consensus amino acid calculated from a given alignment may not be the most stabilizing of all amino acids occurring at that position of the alignment. Consequently, introduction of such a consensus residue may even have a destabilizing e¡ect. However, the sum of the introduced stabilizing and destabilizing interactions is such that a considerable net increase in thermostability is observed. (b) Individual substitutions always a¡ected thermostability by 6 3³C. This may be due to the fact that the amino acid replacements were located mainly in regions with no de¢ned secondary structure on the surface of the molecule. Therefore, the observed increase in phytase thermostability is unlikely to be due to one or a few substitutions introduced just by chance, but is due to the combined e¡ect of a considerable number of small increases in thermostability.</p><p>When all 11 stabilizing residues identi¢ed in the site-directed mutagenesis study were combined in consensus phytase-1, giving rise to consensus phytase-1-thermo <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, or when four destabilizing residues were eliminated and one stabilizing residue introduced in consensus phytase-10, giving rise to consensus phytase-10-thermo <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the unfolding temperature, T m , determined by di¡erential scanning cal-Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>.

In DSC experiments, the puri¢ed proteins, at a concentration of 50^60 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0, were heated at a constant rate of 10³C/ min up to 90^95³C. orimetry was increased further to 88.0^90.4³C (Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Are thermostability and speci¢c activity negatively correlated?</head><p>It was commonly believed for quite some time that high speci¢c activity requires a high £exibility of the protein to undergo conformational changes, with a concomitant negative impact on thermostability. For example, Somero <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> stated: `in order for an enzyme to increase its catalytic e¤ciency, it must `pay the price' of a loss in its thermal stability. Conversely, for an enzyme to increase its thermal stability, it must `pay the price' of a loss in catalytic e¤ciency'. Similar opinions were expressed by Varley and Pain in 1991 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (`These results con¢rm the proposal that a direct relationship and balance holds between thermodynamic stability, dynamics and speci¢c activity in globular proteins. They demonstrate also the constraining e¡ect of increased stability upon conformational dynamics and enzyme activity') and by Shoichet et al. in 1995 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> (`The hypothesis that there is a balance between stability and function can be stated most strongly as follows: protein residues that contribute to catalysis or ligand binding are not optimal for protein stability. This `stability function' hypothesis predicts that it usually should be possible to replace residues known to be important for function, reducing protein activity but concomitantly increasing stability of the folded protein'). As demonstrated by directed evolution and rational design experiments, these hypotheses are not the full truth. For instance, six generations of random mutagenesis, recombination, and screening increased the T m of Bacillus subtilis p-nitrobenzyl esterase by s 14³C without compromising its catalytic activity at 30³C <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Similarly, ¢ve generations of random mutagenesis, recombination, and screening increased the temperature optimum of B. subtilis subtilisin E by 17³C and, at the same time, increased the catalytic e¤ciency (k cat /K m ) by a factor of 5^6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Finally, eight rationally designed mutations increased the temperature optimum of a thermolysin-like protease from Bacillus stearothermophilus by 21³C, from 74 to 95³C, with no negative impact on its catalytic e¤ciency at 37³C <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Therefore, speci¢c activity and thermostability are at least partially independent properties and can be optimized together in the same enzyme.</p><p>This conclusion is fully corroborated by the consensus phytases. Although in the consensus approach, possible negative impacts on the catalytic properties were in no way considered and/or addressed, consensus phytase-1, surprisingly, had catalytic properties (speci¢c activity, pH optimum, and substrate speci¢city) very similar to those of Aspergillus fumigatus or Aspergillus nidulans phytase, despite a 16^26³C higher thermostability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Likewise, the speci¢c activities of consensus phytase-1-thermo <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> Q27T, K68A (approx. 195 U (mg protein) 31 ) and consensus phytase-10-thermo <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Q27T, K68A (approx. 140 U (mg protein) 31 ) were comparable to or higher than that of A. fumigatus phytase Q27T, K68A (approx. 120 U (mg protein) 31 ; all at 37³C and pH 5.5), despite an up to 28³C higher thermostability. The mutations Q27T and K68A were introduced in all those constructs since they improve the catalytic properties of the enzyme for practical use ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; Wyss et al., in preparation); on the other hand, they have virtually no e¡ect on the thermostability of the protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p><p>The virtual uncoupling of improvements in thermostability from e¡ects on the catalytic properties of the enzyme may be due to the facts that (i) residues that are important for catalysis (active site) and for the proper folding of the protein (primarily residues in the hydrophobic core) are usually more conserved than amino acid residues on the surface of the molecule, and that, therefore, (ii) the consensus concept primarily a¡ects the latter surface residues. Notably, it has been suggested by others that engineering of surface residues may in fact be more successful for increasing the stability of a protein than engineering of core residues (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>In recent years, there has been widespread enthusiasm for `directed evolution' as a new tool to optimize the properties of an enzyme of interest (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr">[34^36]</ref>). This enthusiasm is based on the increasing ease of generating and screening large numbers of mutant enzymes by powerful laboratory automation, and on some impressive examples of improved enzymes. In addition, directed evolution circumvents the problem still inherent in rational design principles that the e¡ects of designed mutations are not reliably predictable, but have to be tested individually. In regard to thermostability engineering, the enthusiasm for directed evolution has culminated in statements that question the usefulness of rational approaches in general. For instance, `..., if life began at high temperature and the ancestors of today's mesophiles were thermophilic, thermostability likely drifted down while enhanced activity at low temperatures was acquired. If thermostability is drifting in mesophilic (or psychrophilic) enzymes, sequence comparisons of homologous enzymes are unlikely to provide useful rules for engineering protein stability' <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. And: `The present study strongly supports the notion that enzymes are stabilized by the cumulative e¡ects of small improvements at many locations within the protein molecule. Thus ``the holy grail'' for protein stabilization, rules that are general and easy to apply, probably does not exist' <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Our ¢ndings on the consensus phytases contradict these conclusions and demonstrate that based on an alignment of homologous amino acid sequences and by calculation of a consensus protein, the thermostability of an enzyme can be increased in a single step by more than 20³C. Therefore, the semi-rational consensus concept, which is an easily applicable, straightforward and rapid approach for the (thermo)stabilization of proteins, may be a useful alternative to the technically demanding directed evolution approaches. All results on the various consensus phytases, together with the stabilizing e¡ects of individual consensus residues in immunoglobulin V L and V H domains investigated by Steipe and co-workers [18^21] are reason enough to believe that the concept is generally applicable. It is presently unclear, however, what the biophysical basis for the thermostabilizing e¡ect of consensus residues is, and whether the consensus concept has additional implications for protein evolution in general.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig.1.
