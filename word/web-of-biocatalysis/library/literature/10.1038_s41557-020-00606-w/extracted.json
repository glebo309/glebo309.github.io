Each suspension was then serially diluted to 10 -6 in the Ringer's solution. Each diluted sample was homogenised by gentle inversion and 150 µL plated onto 1.5 % (w/v) agar plates containing either modified R2A growth media or Trypticase Peptone Agar (TPA), supplemented with 5 g / L yeast, with all plates containing nystatin (50 µg / mL). This was repeated with serial agar dilutions"
