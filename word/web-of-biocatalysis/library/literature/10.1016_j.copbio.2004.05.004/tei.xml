<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The laboratory approach to Darwinian evolution of biological macromolecules, often referred to as directed molecular evolution, presents a powerful means for exploring and altering enzyme substrate specificity and catalysis. In contrast to rational design, which generally concentrates on a small number of variants, evolutionary methods for protein engineering rely on the generation of vast molecular diversity by random mutagenesis and recombination. From among the thousands, millions or even billions of progeny, effective search engines such as genetic complementation and high-throughput screening identify candidates with improvements in a desired phenotype. Multiple iterations of this two-step process have led to the identification of numerous proteins with novel catalytic, biophysical, and molecular recognition properties (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>).</p><p>Methods for constructing diverse molecular libraries continue to accumulate. More important than the motivation to circumvent patent laws, these new approaches aim to generate more comprehensive, less biased libraries. This emerging focus on library quality is also reflected in new computational methods. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms offer valuable assistance in the design and analysis of directed evolution experiments.</p><p>New and exciting trends in directed evolution extend beyond library construction. Although the maxim that 'you get what you select for' <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref> remains unavoidable, methods for identifying the properties that we actually desire are improving. Joining the ranks of genetic selection, panning for binding, and high-throughput screening, elegant in vitro selection systems for true catalysis now provide a powerful tool for library deconvolution.</p><p>Finally, several groups have started to address the fundamentals of directed molecular evolution. These detailed library analyses characterizing evolutionary intermediates and comparing existing methodologies provide valuable lessons for shaping the next generation of techniques and experimental design strategies.</p><p>In this review we will discuss each of these aspects, emphasizing their general applicability to, and implications for, the field of directed molecular evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods for creating molecular diversity</head><p>Oligonucleotide-directed randomization, the error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR), and in vitro recombination remain the cornerstones of directed molecular evolution (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">4]</ref>). However, several groups have recently reported interesting variations and modifications to these protocols (summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Oligonucleotide-directed randomization</head><p>Synthesizing partially or fully randomized oligonucleotides provides a means to generate diversity at specific locations in a gene. However, as discussed by Hughes et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5 ]</ref>, the degeneracy of the genetic code ensures that increasing the number of randomized codons decreases the efficiency of randomization. They provide a novel solution, in which a set of primers containing 20 MAX (for 'maximum efficiency') codons -those used preferentially to encode each amino acid in Escherichia coli -are hybridized to a template containing fully randomized (NNN or NNK, where N represents any nucleotide and K represents G or T) codons. Replacement of the template strand is then effected by PCR. This MAX randomization necessitates the synthesis of at least 20 oligonucleotides per experiment, and does not allow for the randomization of multiple adjacent codons. However, by removing superfluous redundancy it offers the considerable advantage of decreasing library sizes required at the DNA level, while maintaining diversity amongst the encoded proteins. A method for the inverse outcome, protecting one specified codon while the remainder of the gene is targeted for randomization, has also been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In a second example, palindromic hexamer DNA duplexes representing the 20 proteinogenic amino acids as codon pairs have been used to replace large sections of the TEM-1 b-lactamase gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>. Remarkably, by ligat-ing hexamer pools with a minimal segment of the blactamase gene -with no selection for the size of the resulting randomized constructs -several soluble, functional daughter sequences were obtained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole gene randomization</head><p>In addition to oligonucleotide-directed methods for random mutagenesis at selected positions (vide supra), whole gene epPCR approaches have also been modified and improved. A method of 'sequence saturation mutagenesis' <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref> has been devised to address the polymeraseinduced biases inherent in traditional protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>. It makes use of universal bases such as inosine to afford control over the mutational spectra obtained, although lacks the technical simplicity of epPCR. Polymerases Increases number of crossovers; some variability in crossover location <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24 ]</ref> Abbreviations: WT, wild-type; GST, glutathione-S-tranferase; nr, not reported.</p><p>such as Stratagene's second-generation Mutazyme 1 (<ref type="url" target="http://www.stratagene.com/">http://www.stratagene.com/</ref>) -which in combination with Taq DNA polymerase displays a uniform mutational spectrum -would appear to provide a simpler, more generally applicable method for constructing unbiased epPCR libraries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homology-dependent recombination</head><p>The most dramatic results in the field of directed evolution are united in their utilization of in vitro recombination. One intuitive and significant advance came with the near-simultaneous descriptions of 'degenerate homoduplex recombination' <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10 ]</ref>, 'synthetic shuffling' <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[11 ]</ref> and 'assembly of designed oligonucleotides' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[12 ]</ref>. In each, overlapping oligonucleotides encoding all of the degeneracy found in two or more parental genes are used as substrates in a polymerasemediated reassembly reaction. The result is a library in which all shuffled variants are equally likely, regardless of whether or not parental diversity is tightly linked. The statistical basis of the advantages of this approach has also been discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[13]</ref>.</p><p>Other variant methods for homology-dependent recombination include 'recombination-dependent exponential amplification PCR' (RDA-PCR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[14]</ref>, 'mutagenic and unidirectional reassembly' (MURA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[15]</ref>, and 'recombined extension on truncated templates' (RETT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[16]</ref>.</p><p>The former is closely related to staggered extension process (StEP) PCR <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[17]</ref>, with the use of gene-specific primers guaranteeing an odd number of crossovers (but most commonly only one). MURA consists of a combination of incremental truncation (ITCHY <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19]</ref>) and DNA shuffling mediated by a unidirectional primer; the result is a library of shuffled sequences that have been randomly truncated from one terminus. Finally, RETT seeks to avoid possible sequence biases arising from the use of DNase I digestion to generate shuffling blocks by instead using unidirectional, random priming from a singlestranded template. Template switching during reassembly results in recombination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Homology-independent recombination</head><p>Homology-independent or structure-guided recombination has also seen several recent developments. 'Sequence-independent site-directed chimeragenesis' (SISDC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[20 ]</ref> has expanded the concept of library construction by shuffling semi-rationally designed peptide building blocks. Although somewhat similar to 'structurebased combinatorial protein engineering' (SCOPE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[21]</ref>, which uses visual inspection of protein structures to guide building block design, SISDC instead relies on the computational predictor SCHEMA (vide infra) to define peptide fragments from the parental proteins that can be interchanged with minimal structural interference. The subsequent combinatorial reassembly of these peptide fragments through clever use of restriction sites resulted in chimeras of the desired diversity, including hybrids that retained activity. However, these methods are (at least currently) limited to proteins with known threedimensional structures.</p><p>An attractive approach to homology-independent recombination remains the construction of multiple-crossover libraries in which crossover positions are randomly distributed. SCRATCHY, the first method described for creating such libraries <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[22]</ref>, yielded a minority of clones containing greater than one crossover. Moreover, a preselection for catalytically active, single-crossover parents was necessary to identify in-frame clones. This step inevitably eliminated numerous in-frame singlecrossover clones that may have proven beneficial in the shuffled multiple-crossover SCRATCHY library. A new vector for the purpose of reading frame selection was subsequently constructed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[23]</ref>. In addition, a method to increase the number of crossovers in SCRAT-CHY libraries was reported by Georgiou, Benkovic and coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[24 ]</ref>. Single-crossover ITCHY libraries were divided into arbitrary sections and amplified with skewed sets of primers. The goal was to enrich for crossovers within broad sections of the chimera, rather than at strictly defined locations, and also to allow for some control over crossover number. The amplification products were used in the subsequent DNA shuffling step, where the increased concentration of heterologous fragments led to higher crossover numbers in the reassembled progeny.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational methods in directed evolution</head><p>In parallel with experimental techniques for directed molecular evolution, computational predictive frameworks have made dramatic advances in recent years (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref>). Although the field of de novo protein design has enjoyed some spectacular successes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">27]</ref>, this review will focus on computational approaches developed to complement directed evolution experiments.</p><p>Computational methods in the context of directed evolution can rationalize published experimental results and guide future engineering studies. Potentially, the integration of computational data in library design will also allow researchers to focus on smaller -but more targeted and comprehensive -libraries, making previously untenable screening methods viable. In turn, this should generate a more detailed picture of the sequence space under investigation and provide insight into the structure-function relationships of proteins.</p><p>Recent reports demonstrate the increasingly successful use of iterations between modeling and experimental testing to evolve more reliable in silico predictors for protein engineering. Conceptually, these algorithms can be divided into two groups: simulating DNA recombination; and predicting the functional consequences of amino acid and peptide fragment substitution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DNA models</head><p>Algorithms to model recombination have relied on the hydrogen-bonding requirement between complementary strands and the energetics of nearest-neighbor interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[25]</ref>. By integrating various contributing factors to DNA shuffling, such as fragmentation conditions, thermodynamic constraints and kinetic effects, Maheshri and Schaffer have improved the model for in vitro recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[28]</ref>. Their predictions were largely confirmed by an accompanying set of experimental data. However, the main drawback of previous algorithms still remains: modeling the processes of library generation at the nucleic acid level provides no information on the functions of translated protein products.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Protein models</head><p>Computational methods have also been employed to simulate directed evolution by quantifying the impact of replacement, insertion, and deletion of building blocks in proteins. Scanning the known three-dimensional structures of protein engineering candidates for local networks of interactions, the SCHEMA algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[29]</ref> can identify recombination points between proteins that minimize the disruption of favorable steric and electrostatic interactions. Although the approach has shown some promise in guiding the generation of hybrid b-lactamases <ref type="bibr">[20 ,30]</ref>, it only sums interactions within defined primary sequence windows and does not account for equally important interactions between distal residues.</p><p>Alternatively, the second-order mean-field identification of residue-residue clashes in hybrid proteins (SIRCH) procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[31 ]</ref> can identify and quantify potential conflicts (in terms of energy) between residues from parental sequences in the context of their tertiary structures.</p><p>Relying on the proteins' total energy, as calculated from individual rotamer energies at each position, the approach successfully predicted local and long-distance clashes on two model systems. Although the calculated severity of unfavorable interactions was not always consistent with the experimental findings, overall predictions of preferred crossover points showed a promising correlation with laboratory data. Two other approaches, dubbed 'residue correlation analysis' (RCA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[32]</ref> and FamClash <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[33]</ref>, borrow from bioinformatics by using multiple sequence alignments to recognize protein residues that vary in a coordinated fashion. Tested on dihydrofolate reductase, the resulting correlation maps identify potential clashes between regions of the parental structures. An interesting aspect of these results was the discovery of distant residues (&gt;8 A ˚apart) that showed correlated amino acid substitution patterns. Networks of coupled motions, affecting the dynamic and even the functional properties of proteins, may explain this phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[34]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In vitro selection for catalysis</head><p>For a successful directed evolution experiment, generating a large library is optional, but being able to recover the targeted progeny is mandatory. The development of novel and improved methods for library analysis is therefore as important as new approaches for creating library diversity. Among the variety of selection and screening techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[35]</ref>, particularly exciting advances have been reported in three areas of in vitro selection.</p><p>Blackburn, Plu ¨ckthun and co-workers recently demonstrated the ability of phage display to select for catalytic activity, describing a selection based on the complete catalytic cycle of phosphate monoester hydrolysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[36 ]</ref>.</p><p>In their system, catalytic antibodies were identified that could hydrolyze an aryl phosphate. By design, the hydrolysis product spontaneously rearranged into a quinonemethide, which in turn reacted with nucleophiles at or near the active site of the catalyst, thereby capturing the phage particle.</p><p>Although phage display remains the most common technique for in vitro selection, water-in-oil in vitro compartmentalization (IVC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[37]</ref> has emerged as a promising and robust alternative for selecting or screening for catalytic function. Recent implementations have included selection for a HaeIII methyltransferase with altered sequence specificity <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[38]</ref> and the description of water-in-oil-inwater double emulsions that are readily amenable to screening via fluorescence-activated cell sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[39]</ref>. IVC has also been used with DNA display libraries, in which biotinylated DNA templates encode streptavidin fusion proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[40]</ref>. Improvements in this method make it a useful complement to phage display for identifying peptide ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[41]</ref>. Finally, Griffiths and Tawfik adapted their IVC system to identify functional phosphotriesterase variants from a microbead-displayed library <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[42 ]</ref>. In an outcome similar to most genetic selections, all 35 variants analyzed had different sequences, and in spite of activities ranging from &lt;1% to 180% that of the wild-type enzyme, the parental sequence was not observed. This observation emphasizes the strong analogy between compartmentalization in the cell and by IVC.</p><p>In an extension of the ribosome display and mRNAprotein fusion systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[43]</ref>, McGregor and co-workers described CIS display <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[44 ]</ref>. Their approach exploits the ability of the RepA protein to bind exclusively to the DNA from which it has been expressed. A library variant fused to the N terminus of RepA therefore remains tightly associated with its encoding DNA and the stability issues of the RNA-based techniques are avoided. The fidelity of this cis-activity obviates the requirement for any compartmentalization and facilitates transcription and translation entirely in vitro, potentially giving access to very large libraries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks: quality over quantity</head><p>The most heartening developments in the field over the past year have been ideological, not methodological. Inspection of Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> makes apparent the trend away from simply constructing the largest libraries possible towards identifying variants from smaller, higher quality libraries. As discussed above, improvements in predictive algorithms will facilitate increasingly reliable in silico library prescreening. Further -and in contrast to the approach of the 'blind watchmaker' that typifies most results to date -two noteworthy papers indicate a new willingness to dissect more fundamental aspects of directed evolution in carefully defined systems.</p><p>Rothman and Kirsch have investigated the evolution of tyrosine aminotransferase (TATase) from a narrowspecificity aspartate aminotransferase (AATase) ancestor <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[45 ]</ref>. Their study compared directly the outcomes of rational redesign <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[46]</ref> and DNA shuffling. Summarizing the similarities and differences between the two enzymes using Venn diagrams provided a particularly elegant way of investigating 'what makes a TATase'. As expected, mutations in the set AAT -TAT (i.e. residues conserved in AATases but not in TATases) were heavily over-represented in evolved variants. The results also provided an illustration of how directed evolution can be employed to elucidate pathways of natural evolution. In this case they provided further evidence for a model in which the evolution of one specialized enzyme from another, be it in nature or in the laboratory, proceeds via broadspecificity intermediates <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">48]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, Matsumura and co-workers applied the theory and terminology of classical genetics in presenting the first rigorous side-by-side comparison of methods for generating molecular diversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[49 ]</ref>. In addition to their discussion of how sexual and asexual evolutionary approaches lead to distinct progeny, their data demonstrated that even small changes in the screening protocol could alter the experimental outcome.</p><p>In summary, we expect that the powerful combination of in silico and in vitro methods for directed evolution will further accelerate the successful manipulation and tailoring of biocatalysts. Equally exciting, these tools will herald an era in which the untapped potential of directed evolution is applied to fundamental questions of macromolecular structure-function relationships and evolutionary biology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Update</head><p>Liu and co-workers have recently described a modified version of their nonhomologous random recombination (NRR) method for nucleic acid evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[50]</ref>, enabling its use for protein-encoding genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[51]</ref>. Their novel approach utilized DNA hairpins during gene fragment ligation, affording some control over the reassembly process. Protein NRR on a chorismate mutase model system yielded functional hybrids containing dramatically reordered and recombined parental sequences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Summary of new technologies for generating molecular diversity.</figDesc><table><row><cell>Methodology</cell><cell>Target</cell><cell cols="2">Library size Outcome</cell><cell>Advantage/disadvantage</cell><cell>Ref.</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Oligonucleotide-directed randomization</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>MAX randomization</cell><cell>Zinc-finger protein</cell><cell>1 Â 10 2</cell><cell>More uniform codon distribution;</cell><cell>Reduces target</cell><cell>[5 ]</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>bias from genetic code removed</cell><cell>library size</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Codon shuffling</cell><cell>TEM-1 b-lactamase</cell><cell>1 Â 10 3</cell><cell>Severely truncated, divergent</cell><cell>Randomization not</cell><cell>[7]</cell></row><row><cell>(hexamer assembly)</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>sequences retain near-WT activity</cell><cell>constrained by length</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>of parental gene</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Whole gene randomization</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>Sequence Saturation</cell><cell>Green fluorescent</cell><cell>nr</cell><cell>100 clones sequenced;
