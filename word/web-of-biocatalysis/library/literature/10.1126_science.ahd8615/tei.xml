<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>BACKGROUND: Biocatalysis is an approach to synthetic chemistry in which enzymes carry out chemical reactions. Historically, enzymes from natural sources have been used to break down oils and proteins in laundry detergents, produce semisynthetic antibiotics, and create simple chiral precursors for the pharmaceutical industry. In the past 5 years, the number of available protein sequences has increased by a staggering 20-fold, accelerating the discovery of enzymes with useful activities and properties. Directed evolution, the cornerstone of our ability to tailor enzymatic properties, is allowing researchers to tailor enzymes for the synthesis of complex molecules, the modification of biological therapeutics, and the breakdown of plastic waste. Machine learning-driven proteinstructure prediction, coupled with advances in automation and high-throughput screening, is further advancing our ability to create enzymes with desired function. The ability to add nonbiological catalytic elements to enzymes means that enzyme engineers no longer have to rely solely on natural catalytic machinery. Scientists have thus gained the capacity to redesign, reimagine, and repurpose enzymes. Illustrative applications include enzyme cascades to manufacture the antivirals islatravir and molnupiravir, biocatalysts that can generate and control radicals, and enzymes that exploit photocatalysis to affect stereocontrolled C-C couplings, hydroaminations, or Diels-Alder reactions.</p><p>ADVANCES: The past 5 years have witnessed a surge in the development of data-driven tools enabling the accelerated discovery, engineering, and deployment of enzymes for applications in chemistry, medicine, and food technology. By leveraging enzymes' ability to control the environment of a chemical reaction, scientists have developed successful platforms for the construction of complex small molecules from suitable starting materials or even CO 2 . In addition to their use in (chemo)-enzymatic cascade reactions, precisely tailored biocatalysts can manufacture new therapeutic modalities, such as antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics, and bioconjugates. DNA synthesis, which still relies on phosphoramidite chemistry, is being reinvented with template-independent deoxynucleotidyl transferases to make the process faster and cheaper. Machine learning, already dominating protein-structure prediction and design, is finding applications in enzyme engineering, including improvement of functions such as enantioselectivity, activity, and stability.</p><p>OUTLOOK: In the decade ahead, biocatalysis research and applications will continue to profit from advances in data mining, machine learning, and DNA reading and writing. The combinatorial design of enzymes and the ease with which new enzyme variants can be experimentally generated lends itself to train data-intense machine-learning algorithms. Ideally, the sequence-function data of variants screened in a directed-evolution campaign could be used to predict which variants to evaluate next. Machine learning works best with clean and reproducible data, mandating the standardization and reporting of data and the further development of experimental techniques, including molecular biology methods, automation, and high-throughput screening assays.</p><p>The toolbox of drug discovery is expanding beyond traditional small molecules (molecular weights &lt;500 g/mol) to include RNA therapeutics, protein degraders, cyclopeptides, antibody drug conjugates, and gene therapy. Consequently, the synthetic complexity of lead molecules and clinical candidates is increasing with a growing percentage of chiral and beyond-ruleof-5 molecules. Enzymatic synthesis will play a key role beyond its present impact in smallmolecule drug discovery and development.</p><p>The discovery of new enzyme families and the rational design of new enzyme functions will expand the toolbox of available biocatalysts. Development and deployment of retrosynthetic tools containing enzymatic reactions will be an important step toward democratizing biocatalysis and making it available to the nonexpert. Fueled by these innovations, nature's catalysts will be profitably used to address current challenges, including the fight against diseases, provision of affordable clean energy, and reduc- Biocatalysis harnesses enzymes to make valuable products. This green technology is used in countless applications from bench scale to industrial production and allows practitioners to access complex organic molecules, often with fewer synthetic steps and reduced waste. The last decade has seen an explosion in the development of experimental and computational tools to tailor enzymatic properties, equipping enzyme engineers with the ability to create biocatalysts that perform reactions not present in nature. By using (chemo)-enzymatic synthesis routes or orchestrating intricate enzyme cascades, scientists can synthesize elaborate targets ranging from DNA and complex pharmaceuticals to starch made in vitro from CO 2 -derived methanol. In addition, new chemistries have emerged through the combination of biocatalysis with transition metal catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis. This review highlights recent key developments, identifies current limitations, and provides a future prospect for this rapidly developing technology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>T</head><p>o innovate in synthetic chemistry, academic and industrial scientists increasingly apply enzymes to make simple and complex functionalized (bio)molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Inspired by the precise control that enzymes can exert over reaction outcomes, chemists are using biocatalytic transformations that complement or even substitute for more traditional chemical routes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. However, as synthetically relevant reactions rarely have a counterpart in nature, the challenge in biocatalysis is the identification of a suitable enzyme catalyst for the desired application. Early uses of biocatalysis relied on accessible wildtype enzymes used in food or other industries to produce laundry detergents, semisynthetic antibiotics, and simple chiral precursors for the pharmaceutical industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Although such repurposing still occurs occasionally, most new applications require the discovery of enzymes with distinct reactivity or the engineering of existing enzymes to catalyze the desired reaction, accept the desired substrate, and be stable and active at the desired application conditions. The computational and experimental advances of the past few years have sped and simplified the tailoring of biocatalysts to access a rapidly growing set of chemical transformations. Today, strategies for the development of performant biocatalysts include screening natural diversity to discover a desired enzyme activity, engineering biocatalysts to alter the substrate range, redesigning mechanisms to create previously unknown reactivity, and computationally designing enzymes de novo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). These strategies now allow the field to be much bolder in choosing which reactions are attempted enzymatically. Biocatalysts are being redesigned, reimagined, and repurposed to grant access to the desired targets with great efficiency.</p><p>Here, we evaluate the recent experimental and computational developments that led to this boost in biocatalysis and its applications (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Highlighted experimental innovations include optimized strategies to read and write DNA, advanced tools for automation and highthroughput screening, and the ability to incorporate novel catalytic elements into enzymes, including noncanonical amino acids. Computational progress is reflected in improved access to suitable enzyme-encoding sequences, machine learning-based methods to accurately predict protein structures, and data-driven tools to guide enzyme engineering in the creation of information-enriched, functional variant libraries. These achievements have translated into a variety of applications, including (chemo-) enzymatic cascade reactions, new-to-nature chemistries, enzymatic plastic degradation, and the synthesis of biologics and therapeutics (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Developing biocatalysts</head><p>There are several approaches that can be used to find or create an enzyme with the desired catalytic activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. First, the target activity could exist in nature but needs to be discovered. High-quality, low-cost sequencing of DNA has now revealed complete genomes of species from all over the globe <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>, as well as DNA fragments from metagenome samples. The number of available protein sequences increased more than 20-fold in the last 5 years [2023, &gt;2.4 billion (9, 10); 2018, ~123 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>]. Searching these sequences reveals many putative enzymes, some with predictable activities and many that are of unknown function. Combining this sequence data with computational tools such as sequence similarity networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>, phylogenetic analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>, and protein-structure prediction improves the precision of the search.</p><p>In a representative example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolases (PETases) to degrade PET plastics were found through classical screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, bioinformatics searches <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, and sequencing of environmental samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Alternatively, legacy enzyme collections of enzymes that proved useful in the past are an invaluable resource for identifying suitable biocatalysts or advanced starting points for engineering projects. Commercially available enzyme screening kits and private libraries of enzyme variants for frequently used enzymes such as lipases, esterases, ketoreductases, and transaminases can considerably shorten timelines toward yielding biocatalysts with the desired target activity. More recently, advances in protein structure prediction (see "Computational tools" section below) have further improved the search for suitable enzymes in sequence databases. For example, in a search for dehalogenases, a sequence similarity search identified 2905 putative target enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. Subsequent analysis of homology modelswhich considered the size of the active site, the presence of catalytic residues, and tunnels to access the active site-narrowed the search to 45 genes, 40 of which yielded catalytically active dehalogenases.</p><p>The most common strategy to access a desired enzymatic function is repurposing of an existing enzyme that fits many, but not all, requirements for the new application. Often an existing enzyme catalyzes the desired reaction but does not accept the desired substrate or does not produce the desired product isomer. In this situation, protein engineering is required to shift the substrate or product preference of the enzyme. For example, the redesign of an aspartase enabled the hydroamination of a,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids to make b-amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. The target substrates contained a hydrophobic substituent at the position corresponding to the a-carboxylate of aspartic acid. The design replaced four mostly polar amino acids in the binding site with hydrophobic amino acids. In another case, triggered by the need for selective halogenation reactions, researchers expanded the substrate range of Fe(II)/a-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenases to include nonnatural substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, such as the macrolide soraphen A, a potent fungicide. By using algorithm-aided engineering, the apparent turnover number (k cat ) for soraphen was improved &gt;100-fold, turning the halogenase into a suitable catalyst for aiding in structure-activity relationship studies in medicinal chemistry. The halogenase also accepts other anions, including azide, nitrate, and nitrite, enabling the creation of a wider range of products <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. In another example the selectivity of a protease was altered to degrade gluten peptides as a potential supplement for patients with celiac disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. The starting protease favored hydrolysis after a Pro-Arg/Lys sequence, whereas gluten contains many Pro-Gln-Gln/Leu sequences. Hydrolysis was desired between Gln and Gln/Leu residues. The researchers introduced eight substitutions, two in the new Gln site, one in the Gln/Leu site, and five more distant substitutions to stabilize the protein. The modified protease is currently undergoing clinical trials.</p><p>The concept of "substrate walking"-evolving an enzyme from transforming its natural substrate to accepting an industrially relevant substrates was rarely applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref> a little over a decade ago. The evolution of a transaminase to manufacture sitagliptin ( <ref type="formula">26</ref>) is an early example. Today, Pictet-Spenglerases that use benzaldehyde <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, flavin-dependent halogenases active on high-molecular weight indoles and carbazoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>, opine dehydrogenases (reduc-tive aminases) that use amines and ketones as opposed to amino-and ketoacids <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>, and transketolases that use nonpolar aromatic substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> have all been created through substrate walking.</p><p>In more difficult cases, no enzyme with the desired reactivity exists, but an enzyme with a mechanistically similar catalytic activity is known. Combining chemical reasoning with protein engineering can extend the natural catalytic activity to the desired activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. One example is the expansion of the catalytic repertoire of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases to catalyze carbene and nitrene reactions. Their oxidase mechanism involves an iron porphyrin oxo (Fe=O) intermediate, and it was reasoned that iron carbene [Fe=C(R1)(R2)] and iron nitrene (Fe=NR) species might form similarly given the appropriate reactive substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. Initial experiments revealed inefficient reactions, but optimization by directed evolution and replacement of the proximal thiolate heme ligand with the more weakly donating serineyielding the so-called P411 scaffolds-led to catalysts capable of new-to-nature chemistry, including cyclopropanation, cyclopropenation, Si-C bond formation, B-C bond formation, C-H insertion, and alkyl transfer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, as well as aziridination, sulfide imidation, C-H amidation, and C-H amination (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. These examples are enzyme-catalyzed reactions in vitro, but this new-to-nature carbenetransfer chemistry was also used to extend biosynthesis in vivo. Engineered Streptomyces strains biosynthesized a carbene-transfer reagent, azaserine, as well as the acceptor styrene, to yield unnatural cyclopropanes <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. P450 monooxygenases can also be repurposed by following other strategies. For example, the P450 monooxygenase from Labrenzia agreggata was fashioned into a ketone synthase capable of the direct oxidation of internal arylalkenes to ketones by harnessing highly reactive carbocation species as key intermediates (37). To cite another example, researchers found that P450-based radical cyclases could be developed through the exploitation of a metalloredox strategy to catalyze stereoselective atom-transfer radical reactions yielding substituted g-lactams <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> or arenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>.</p><p>Changes in catalytic activity can also be more drastic; for example, a reductase was extended to a cyclase that forms C-C bonds through radical intermediates. Flavin-dependent "ene" reductases normally catalyze the reduction of electronically activated alkenes through the stepwise addition of H 2 -the first step occurring through a hydride transfer (a two-electron transfer) from the flavin hydroquinone, followed by the second step, a proton transfer from a conserved tyrosine residue (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). In other enzymes, flavins reduce substrates through two single-electron transfers, which creates radical intermediates. By replacing the activated alkene substrate of an ene reductase with an a-bromo ketone, which is a radical Redesigning Enzyme Mechanism Computational Design Screening Nature's Diversity Performance Generations native substrate non-native substrate Performance Sequence space Performance Accessible chemistry chemical intuition Performance Structure space theozyme scaffold optimization RESEARCH | REVIEW</p><p>precursor, the ene reductase changes its mechanism and transfers a single electron. Rapid loss of bromide yields the corresponding a-ketonyl radical. In an appropriately selected substrate, this radical may cyclize, forming a C-C bond and abstracting a hydrogen atom from the flavin semiquinone <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The surrounding active site guides the formation of new stereocenters in the product. Thus, the resulting reaction is an enantioselective reductive cyclization.</p><p>In other cases, radical precursors are less reactive and require light irradiation to initiate the single-electron transfer. In photobiocatalysis, a cofactor or amino acid within the protein active site is photoexcited to promote the electron or energy transfer required to convert starting materials to desired products. Only three natural enzymes follow this synthetic logic: fatty acid photodecarboxylase <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, DNA photolyase <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>, and protochlorophyllide reductase <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. Whereas the latter two enzymes have less synthetic relevance, fatty-acid decarboxylases have been studied to catalyze the hydrodecarboxylation of fatty acids, a redoxneutral reaction that leads to alkanes, rendering them promising catalysts for biofuel production <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref> and chemical building-block synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>.</p><p>Apart from radical cyclizations of well-chosen organohalides <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, the photobiocatalysis ap-proach similarly allows the alkylation of arenes (47), the asymmetric cross-electrophile coupling of alkyl halides and nitroalkanes (48) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>), and hydroaminations through the generation of amidyl radicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. Nonenzymatic photoredox catalysts can also generate substrates for enzymes to create new reactions. Adding xanthene-based photocatalysts enabled an ene reductase to catalyze an enantioselective deacetoxylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. In another example, noncanonical amino acids were synthesized by using separate photocatalysis and enzymatic steps. The photocatalysis generates an alkyl radical from an alkyl trifluoroborate precursor. In the same solution, a modified tryptophan </p></div>

Quenching of the radical and release of the intermediate yields a noncanonical amino acid. Adjusting the shape of the active site fine-tuned the enantioselectivity of all described reactions for up to three stereocenters <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>.</p><p>Instead of modifying or extending existing enzymatic activities, researchers have also computationally designed new catalytic activities into a protein scaffold. This de novo design approach identifies the transition state of the desired transformation and then builds a binding site to stabilize it, reducing the problem of biocatalysis to one of molecular recognition. Although de novo enzyme design has created protein catalysts for model transformations, including proton-transfer, bimolecular-aldol, and Diels-Alder reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. The initial activities of the designer catalysts were low, but directed evolution increased their cata-lytic activities. For example, directed evolution of a designed retroaldolase increased its catalytic activity from barely detectable to that of natural enzymes. The directed evolution introduced 31 substitutions, leading to a million-fold increase in activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>. More recently, a deep learning-based approach generated large numbers of idealized protein structures and the sequences that encode it. The diverse scaffolds were employed to design an artificial luciferase. Three substitutions introduced by site-saturation mutagenesis yielded a 100-fold-higher photon flux than did the parent design (k cat /K m = 10 6 M -1 s -1 ) (54) (where k cat /K m is the catalytic efficiency and K m is the Michaelis constant). Although de novo design of enzymes with activities that rival their natural counterparts remains a major challenge at present, these studies have improved our understanding of how sequences fold into proteins and of how basic enzyme activity is created. De novo enzyme design will continue to grow as our understanding of the sequence-function relationship in enzymes improves, protein design methods mature, and computational power increases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental tools</head><p>Regardless of the strategy chosen to identify a suitable biocatalyst, laboratory work is always required to produce and, if needed, to tailor the target enzyme. The range of experimental tools available to protein engineers is consistently expanding, whether by lowering the cost of synthetic genes, speeding up individual directed-evolution cycles, or allowing for introduction of new catalytic elements to be added to proteins.</p><p>Biocatalyst development starts with a DNA construct encoding the enzyme of interest, which requires artificial DNA synthesis. Present DNA synthesis uses phosphoramidite chemistry developed 40 years ago (55); however, DNA synthesis performed with enzymes (56-58) These so-called P411 enzymes, which contain a serine residue as proximal ligand (denoted as X), were evolved to assemble C-C bonds through sp 3 C-H functionalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> and to aminate at benzylic and allylic (not shown) positions to yield (bottom right) enantioenriched, unprotected primary amines <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferases (TdTs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) polymerize deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to the 3′-end of a DNA sequence in a templateindependent fashion. Using dNTPs with a blocked 3′-hydroxyl stops TdT action after a single nucleotide incorporation, hence controlling an otherwise runaway polymerization.

TdT-based approaches have driven DNA oligonucleotide synthesis to (literally) new lengths of up to 1000 nucleotides, enabled by incorporation efficiencies of &gt;99.6%, reviving the promise for rapid, singlerun whole-gene synthesis. Milder aqueous reaction conditions also benefit DNA quality and greatly improve the overall process sustainability, opening up opportunities for gene editing and diagnostic applications. TdTs can also assemble short synthetic RNA fragments.

Building libraries of predefined enzyme variants remains expensive and challenging with these traditional approaches. "Oligo-pools,"-which consist of a few hundred up to 1000 distinct polynucleotides with a length of about 300 base pairs-are a less-expensive alternative solution (0.00001 to 0.001 USD per nucleotide, depending on length, scale, platform, or vendor) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. Despite disadvantages such as truncated DNA molecules and high error rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>, the oligopool option may be more cost-effective than the degenerate or reduced codon-coverage primers typically used for library construction and may allow more flexible library design <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>.</p><p>The cornerstone of protein engineering (1, 3, 67, 68), the Nobel prize-winning strategy of directed evolution, relies heavily on such randomized gene libraries. When directed evolution appeared three decades ago, error-prone PCR was the driver of sequence variability, resulting in round-over-round accumulation of single mutations and an approximated twofold improvement of enzyme performance per round of evolution (69) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, light blue curve). The contemporaneous addition of recombination techniques upgraded the rate of improvement to between 2.75 and 4 per evolution cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, dashed curves) by incorporating multiple mutations per round, reflecting the state of the art over the past two decades. Computational and molecular biology efforts have improved mutation prediction and accelerated enzymevariant creation so that the screening burden can be reduced, but not to the point that screening cycles or improvements per cycle have been greatly altered from these historical norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. Additionally, protein engineers continue to in-crease the complexity of attempted evolution campaigns. Together, these developments point to an increasing bottleneck in biocatalysis: higher demand for protein-engineering resources and a lack of improvement in the way evolution experiments are performed. Technical innovations are on the horizon, however. Cell-free protein-expression technologies provide all the necessary components to transcribe and translate many DNA sequences into functional proteins, avoiding the time-consuming steps of cell transformation, growth, and induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>. Using this technology to produce enzyme libraries for testing in evolution experiments has the potential to accelerate the time to complete a round of evolution by ~1.6-fold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, green curve). Turning to the biological world, continuous-evolution strategies tie the success of a desired enzyme activity to the growth rate of a producing microbe and simultaneously provide the microbe with a mechanism of introducing mutation into the DNA coding for the desired protein only <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73)</ref>. Evolution of the desired protein then occurs in continuous culture, which circumvents the same laboratory manipulations required for cell-free protein expression and in addition avoids the man-made construction of new variant libraries, leading to an eightfold increase in the rate of evolution performance compared with error-prone PCR [and a fivefold improvement compared with current state of the art (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, periwinkle curve)]. For example, mRNA display libraries (74) have generated new proteins, new types of catalytic activity, and binding proteins with very high affinity for their targets.

Encapsulating cells into picoliter-sized droplets, along with a lysis reagent and an analytical readout, has allowed scientists to assay thousands of samples per second, which is on par with the rates achieved by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) techniques. Because millions of samples can be analyzed, libraries with multiple mutations per sequence can be screened deeply enough to uncover rare events, reaching 100-fold improvements per evolution round or greater <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>. Although lack of commercialized hardware, relatively high implementation costs, and technical complexity has so far limited the use of such tools to expert practitioners, these strategies show promise for managing the longer evolution timelines required for increasingly complex targets.</p><p>Other emerging tools that include useful in protein engineering include cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which has been profitably employed to guide improvement of a nitrilase <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>, and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED), which supported the mechanistic investigation of carbene transfer in a designed protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>. Both methods enable gathering of mechanistic insights and structural data complementary to x-ray crystallography, which nevertheless remains an important tool for generating high-resolution structures, especially of smaller enzymes.</p><p>Complementing the biocatalysts obtained by enzyme-engineering campaigns, some applications require researchers to equip proteins with new-to-nature functionalities. This is achieved through the incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) by using either amber stop-codon suppression or promiscuous aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which expands the repertoire of available catalytic elements beyond those encoded in the 20 proteinogenic amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79)</ref>. ncAAs can be harnessed to tune enzyme properties, reveal mechanisms in complex catalytic machineries, and create enzymes with functions not found in nature.</p><p>An illustrative example of tuning enzyme properties by incorporating ncAAs is the introduction of N d -methylhistidine (NMH) as proximal ligand into the heme protein ascorbate peroxidase, which led to substantial increases in turnover number without compromising catalytic efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Computational tools</head><p>Machine learning-based structure-prediction tools promise to limit the excessive screening or selection necessary to analyze the huge libraries typically generated during directed evolution. The advanced statistics system AlphaFold2, developed by DeepMind, predicts protein structures from amino acid sequence with much greater accuracy than did previous methods. AlphaFold2 uses deep neural networks to predict inter-residue distances from amino acid sequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>. Its predictions rely on the structural data in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<ref type="url" target="http://www.wwpdb.org">www.wwpdb.org</ref>), which contains the threedimensional structures of 200,000 proteins and nucleic acids. The neural networks assume that substructures that appear frequently in the database are more stable than absent or rarely occurring substructures. At present, a database of predicted structures (<ref type="url" target="https://alphafold.com/">https://alphafold.com/</ref>) contains over 200 million entries and is continuously growing. Similarly useful alternatives are RoseTTAFold <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref> and ESMFold <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(92)</ref>, created by Meta Platforms.</p><p>Structure prediction has the potential to reveal the arrangement of active-site residues of the target enzyme, guiding enzyme optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(93)</ref>. However, enzymatic function also requires substrate binding and product release and often relies on cofactors or metal ions. Tools such as AlphaFill <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94)</ref> and DiffDock (95) project missing organic molecules and metal ions into the protein pockets, providing a model that may more accurately reflect the desired chemistry. To capture motion, Alpha-Fold2 can approximate conformational heterogeneity by, for example, reducing the depth of the multiple sequence alignments that serve as input for the algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(96)</ref>, as demonstrated when researchers used AlphaFold2 to create models of alternate conformations of a tryptophan synthase <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(97)</ref>.</p><p>The deep neural networks trained to predict native protein structures from their amino acid sequences can be inverted to design new proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(98)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(99)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(100)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(101)</ref>. The first step is to predict the structure of a random amino acid sequence, which yields parts of a structure with confident predictions and other parts with uncertain predictions. Repeated modification of the amino acid sequence of the uncertain regions eventually leads to a sequence whose entire structure is predicted confidently. Testing these predictions often yields stable proteins with structures close to those predicted. These neural network approaches to protein design are faster than physics-based methods such as Rosetta Match (102), Rosetta Design (103), and Rosetta Ligand (104) because they do not attempt to optimize interactions such as sidechain packing. However, the neural network approaches lack the physical transparency of methods such as Rosetta. Adding diffusion models trained on proteins [similar to Stable Diffusion, used to generate images <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(105)</ref>, or ChatGPT, used to generate text] to protein design expands the number and variety of designs generated, thus increasing the chances of success <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(106)</ref>. Furthermore, language models can generate functional protein sequences across diverse families <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(107)</ref>.</p><p>Although the design of protein structures is improving, design of proteins with catalytic function remains challenging. Design typically yields inefficient enzymes, which then require extensive optimization by directed evolution (see "Experimental tools" section above). This might be because efficient catalysis requires more precise positioning of catalytic groups than is presently achievable with the algorithms. Another reason for this problem is an incomplete understanding of the structural features, including motions, that are needed for catalysis. Classical protein-structure determination with x-ray crystallography uses transition-state analogs or suicide substrates to reveal how a substrate binds to the active site of an enzyme, to learn where binding pockets are located, and to gather information about protein motions that contribute to catalysis. For instance, the structural basis for the higher catalytic activity of lipases at an oil-water interface remained a puzzle despite several available x-ray structures of lipases, which showed a buried catalytic site. Brzozowski et al. solved this puzzle in 1991 with a lipase structure that showed a dramatic movement of a helical lid covering the catalytic site <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(108)</ref>. A more recent puzzle was a monoamine oxidase, whose x-ray structure also showed a closed conformation that could not explain the effects of mutations on catalytic activity and substrate scope. In RESEARCH | REVIEW this case, a computational approach using long-timescale molecular dynamics identified partially and fully open conformations that could account for the changes in catalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(109)</ref>. Current structure-prediction tools do not include protein dynamics in most cases and likewise do not include information about disulfide bonds and posttranslational modifications (which are often not covered in protein sequences in databases) such as glycosylations and acetylations, mandating the use of complementary computational tools and experiments.</p><p>Connecting protein structures to protein functions such as reactivity or selectivity is an advancing field in machine learning.

These enzyme variants enabled installation of a cleavable phenylacetamide protecting group in a programmable manner, while leaving one or more amino groups unprotected for subsequent chemical modification.

DNA polymerase amplifies the complementary sequence in the presence of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) building blocks.

The synthesis uses unprotected building blocks in water, without large amounts of acetonitrile (as is typically the case in solid-phase synthesis), hence addressing a major sustainability challenge. Whether the unprotected NTP will be possible to source on sufficiently large scales with acceptable timelines and cost to fully embed this concept on a manufacturing scale remains to be seen.

(Bottom left)These so-called P411 enzymes, which contain a serine residue as proximal ligand (denoted as X), were evolved to assemble C-C bonds through sp3 C-H functionalization<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> and to aminate at benzylic and allylic (not shown) positions to yield (bottom right) enantioenriched, unprotected primary amines<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Piv, pivaloyl; Tf, trifluoromethanesulfonyl. (B) (Top left) Asymmetric double-bond reduction catalyzed by an ene reductase through a hydride transfer (two-electron transfer) from flavinmononucleotide (FMN) followed by a proton transfer from a conserved tyrosine residue (not shown). By applying photocatalysis, the catalytic machinery of the ene reductase can be repurposed when radical precursors are used as substrates (as shown here, an a-chloro ketone).

Recursive accumulation of single-point mutations, such as those generated by error-prone PCR methods, produces fitness improvements on the order of 2 N (light blue curve).Adding recombination techniques to evolution improves fitness accumulation to between 2.75 N (26) and 4 N (122, 152) (dashed curves), averaging ~3.2 N (pink curve). Cell-free expression technologies increase the rate at which a cycle of evolution can be performed (green curve), and continuous-evolution techniques are estimated to accelerate accumulation of point mutations even more quickly (periwinkle curve). Microfluidics-based ultrahigh throughput screening has yielded 100-fold improvements per round<ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>. N indicates the number of evolution cycles.
