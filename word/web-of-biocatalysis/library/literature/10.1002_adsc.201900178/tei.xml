<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Optically pure 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acids constitute an important class of building blocks for the synthesis of natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals. However, redox deracemization of racemic 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acids as an attractive method is still challenging for the lack of suitable oxidoreductases. Herein, a D-amino acid oxidase from Fusarium solani M-0718 (FsDAAO) with broad substrate scope and excellent enantioselectivity was exploited through genome mining, and applied for the kinetic resolution of a number of racemic 1-and 3-carboxyl substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines to yield the corresponding (S)-enantiomers with excellent enantiomeric excess (ee) values (up to &gt; 99%). By using FsDAAO in combination with ammonia-borane in one pot, deracemization of these racemic carboxyl-substituted tetrahydroisoquinolines was achieved with conversions up to &gt; 98% and &gt; 99% ee. Preparative-scale deracemization of racemic 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid was also demonstrated with good isolated yields (82% and 73%, respectively) and ee &gt; 99%. Our study provides an effective method for the synthesis of enantiomeric pure 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acids. This method is expected to provide access to chiral carboxyl-substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-ßcarbolines.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Chiral 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) are widely distributed in various natural bioactive alkaloids and also serve as important intermediates in pharmaceutical chemistry <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> . Compounds containing THIQ skeleton exhibit a variety of biological activities, such as antitumor <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2]</ref> , antimalarial <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[3]</ref> , anthelmintic <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[4]</ref> , antihypertensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[5]</ref> , targeting of the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[6]</ref> , and inhibiting Keap1-Nrf2 protein-protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[7]</ref> . Their biological activities are occasionally stereoselective in terms of their potency, metabolism and bitter taste <ref type="bibr">[4] [8]</ref> .</p><p>Considerable effort has been devoted to the enantioselective preparation of chiral THIQs. Chemical asymmetric synthesis method are important and frequent sources of these compounds <ref type="bibr">[1a, 5b, 9]</ref> . However, the use of hazardous materials, such as toxic organic reagents or transition metal catalysts, remains a challenge for industrial application. As an alternative to chemical approaches, attention has been gradually directed to elegant and environmentallyfriendly enzymatic methods. In recent years, the preparation of chiral non-carboxyl substituted THIQs have been intensively investigated using redox biocatalysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[10]</ref> . Most notably are the applications of recombinant amine oxidase variants developed by Turner and coworkers, which have been used in the chemo-enzymatic synthesis of chiral 1-alkyl-, benzylor aryl-substituted THIQs (Scheme 1A) <ref type="bibr">[10g-j]</ref> . These enzymatic routes are cost-effective and generally produce excellent enantioselectivity and yield. However, to the best of our knowledge, these biocatalytic approaches mainly focused on noncarboxyl substituted THIQs. The preparation of chiral carboxyl-substituted THIQs, especially 1-substituted THIQs, is still challenging since the actions of suitable oxidoreductases on these compounds had not been described. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to develop novel methods for the preparation of chiral carboxyl-substituted THIQs in both academia and industry.</p><p>Encouraged by the Turner-type deracemization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[11]</ref> , we attempted to design a biocatalytic process to transform the racemic carboxyl-substituted THIQs into optically-pure products using an oxidoreductase in combination with a nonselective chemical reducing agent. The process contained two steps: 1) one of the enantiomers should be oxidized to the corresponding imino acid with high enantioselectivity; 2) the imino acid should be transformed into racemic mixture via nonselective in situ reduction. The enantioselective oxidation and nonselective reduction should run simultaneously and efficiently. The challenge is the exploitation of robust enzymes for the first step. There has been no previous report regarding the biooxidation of the model substrate 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid. However, its analogue, 1-methyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline, is the substrate of monoamine oxidases MAO-N-D5 and LG-I-D11, which can be used in a more generally manner for the oxidation of C-N bond to C=N double bonds in different amines lacking carboxyl group <ref type="bibr">[10h, 12]</ref> . For those amines bearing carboxyl group, Lamino acid oxidases (LAAO, EC 1.4.3.2), L-amino acid deaminases (LAAD), D-amino acid oxidases (DAAO, EC 1.4.3.2) and NADH/NADPH-dependent amino acid dehydrogenases (AADH, EC 1.4.1.X) are known to catalyze the equivalent type of biooxidation transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[13]</ref> .</p><p>Scheme 1. Chemo-enzymatic deracemization of racemic THIQs using (A) amine oxidases (e.g., MAO-N) or (B) Damino acid oxidases (FsDAAO).</p><p>Herein, we describe the first example of the DAAO catalyzed bio-oxidation of racemic carboxylsubstituted THIQs with a preference for the (R)enantiomer (Scheme 1B). An enzyme library containing LAAOs, LAADs, DAAOs, and AADHs was constructed and screened through genome mining. FsDAAO, which was derived from Fusarium solani M-0718 and initially expressed for the production of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[15]</ref> , was achieved. The substrate specificity toward a number of racemic 1-and 3-carboxyl substituted THIQs with different substitutions on the phenyl ring was investigated. Using FsDAAO, we successfully constructed a kinetic resolution system for the highly enantioselective synthesis of (S)-1-and 3-carboxyl substituted THIQs. Furthermore, we combined the FsDAAO with a nonselective chemical reducing agent, ammonia-borane (NH3•BH3), thus providing a novel and general method for the efficient synthesis of optically pure carboxylsubstituted THIQs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploitation and Purification of FsDAAO with Excellent Enantioselectivity toward rac-1a</head><p>To identify an enzyme with good activity and excellent enantioselectivity toward these sterically hindered substrates, a genome mining-based library construction strategy was applied. Considering the structural characteristics of these substrates, which bear a carboxyl group substituent on the chiral carbon atom, an enzyme library containing ten DAAOs, six LAAOs, four LAADs, and fourteen AADHs from different microorganisms was constructed. These oxidoreductases were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Compared with the AADHs, the other three types of enzymes were rather difficult to overexpress, and most were expressed as a partial or total inclusion body. Nevertheless, the activity of the crude extract toward the natural substrates was further measured and the results revealed that four enzymes were expressed without activity among the 34 tested enzymes (Supporting Information, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). After confirming the functional expression of 30 candidate enzymes, we tested their activity on racemic 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid (rac-1a) using crude extract. As a result, four DAAOs of the tested enzymes showed different activities toward rac-1a with strict R-configuration enantioselectivity (ee &gt; 99% with 50% conversion) (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). These four recombinant DAAOs with a His-tag at the N-terminal were then purified using nickel-affinity chromatography, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Supporting Information, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>), indicating a subunit size of approximately 43 kDa. Their specific activities toward rac-1a were further compared. As shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, FsDAAO displayed the highest activity of 0.84 ± 0.05 U/ml and 19.02 ± 0.09 U/mg, and was selected for further research.</p></div>

The specific activities from 20 to 60 °C were then measured. The enzyme exhibited a maximum activity at 45 °C and 62% relative activity at 30 °C (Supporting Information, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3C</ref>). The thermostability of FsDAAO was assessed at 30, 40 and 50 °C (Supporting Information, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3D</ref>). The half-lives of the enzyme were calculated to be 165 h at 30 °C, 114 h at 40 °C and 36 h at 50 °C, indicating good thermal stability, especially under mild reaction conditions. Taken together, pH 8.0 and 30 °C were considered as the biotransformation conditions. The kinetic parameters of FsDAAO toward rac-1a were determined under the same conditions, indicating a catalytic efficiency constant (kcat/Km) of 47.14 s -1 mM -1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Investigation of Substrate Specificity</head><p>Having preliminarily established the FsDAAOmediated enantioselective biotransformation system, we were curious to explore the potential application of this system in biocatalysis. Initially, we examined the oxidative dehydrogenation activity of FsDAAO toward a range of substrates comprising THIQs, Damino acids and their derivatives (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The relative specific activity was measured by employing the coupled o-dianisidine/peroxidase method with purified enzyme at pH 8.0 and 30 °C. The activity of FsDAAO for rac-1a (19.66 ± 0.4 U/mg) was defined as 100%, and the activities relative to rac-1a were calculated.</p><p>In general, FsDAAO exhibited strict stereospecificity toward D-amino acids, as found in other DAAOs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[15]</ref> . Among these D-amino acids, FsDAAO appears to prefer substrates with large hydrophobic side chains, such as D-phenylalanine ((R)-12) and D-methionine ((R)-14). The presence of hydrophilic group in the side chains, such as hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring, significantly reduced the activity. For instance, the relative specific activity toward D-tyrosine ((R)-13) (198%) was only about one third of that toward D-phenylalanine ((R)-12) (564%). 10.1002/adsc.201900178</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Advanced Synthesis &amp; Catalysis</head><p>This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p><p>This trend was also observed in the oxidation of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acids 2a-4a. The substituent groups on the phenyl ring affect the activities, which are of the following order: 6chlorine &gt; 6-hydroxyl &gt; 6,7-methoxyl substituents. Compared with rac-1a, FsDAAO exhibited much lower activity toward 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (rac-5a). No activity was measured with non-carboxyl substituted THIQs, such as <ref type="table">1</ref>,<ref type="table">2</ref>,<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>,<ref type="table">4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (8) or 1-methyl-1</ref>,<ref type="table">2</ref>,<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>,<ref type="table">4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (9)</ref>. The enzyme also displayed some activity toward racemic 1,2,3,4tetrahydroquinoline-2-carboxylic acid (rac-23) and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-ß-carboline-1-carboxylic acid (rac-24), in which the tetrahydroquinoline and tetrahydroß-carboline cores are privileged motifs found in numerous bioactive molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[16]</ref> . Unfortunately, racemic indoline-2-carboxylic acid (rac-21) was not a suitable substrate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Kinetic Resolution of 1-and 3-Carboxyl Substituted THIQs</head><p>After investigation of the substrate specificity, we applied FsDAAO for the kinetic resolution of a group of racemic 1-and 3-carboxyl substituted THIQs with different substitutions on the phenyl ring, which was the interest of this study. To evaluate the stability of substrate, a series of control experiments featuring all reaction conditions but lacking FsDAAO were carried out. After incubation at pH 8.0 and 30 °C for 24 h, chiral HPLC analysis revealed that the concentrations of rac-1a-6a remained unchanged and no side product was observed, confirming that these substrates were stable under the mild conditions. To study the effect of pH on substrate racemization, (S)-1a was incubated at 30 °C in Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0) or Na2CO3-NaHCO3 buffer (pH 10.0). After 24 h, chiral HPLC analysis revealed that no (R)-enantiomer was observed at pH 8.0. However, significant racemization occurred at pH 10.0. Hence, kinetic resolution reactions were performed at pH 8.0 and 30 °C. As shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, racemic substrates 1a-5a were resolved completely into S-enantiomers with excellent enantioselectivity (ee &gt; 99%) and conversions (50%). Exceptionally, even with prolonging the reaction time, reducing the amount of substrate, or adding more enzyme, a relatively low ee (88%) was obtained with 46% conversion when using rac-6a as the substrate, which was attributed to the product inhibition of FsDAAO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One-pot Synthesis of (S)-carboxyl Substituted THIQs via Chemo-enzymatic Deracemization</head><p>Compared with chiral 3-carboxyl substituted THIQs, which could be synthesized from the corresponding chiral amino acids (e.g., L-phenylalanine) <ref type="bibr">[5b]</ref> , asymmetric synthesis of chiral 1-carboxyl substituted THIQs are more difficult. Having obtained the FsDAAO and applied it for the kinetic resolution of carboxyl-substituted THIQs successfully, we attempted to investigate a novel method for the synthesis of (S)-carboxyl substituted THIQs, especially for the 1-carboxyl substituted THIQs, by combination of FsDAAO with a chemical reducing agent in one pot.</p><p>To assess the feasibility, we first analyzed the oxidative dehydrogenation product of (R)-1a. Purified FsDAAO-catalyzed oxidation of (R)-1a was performed and the product was analyzed using NMR and HR-MS. All of these results confirmed that the product was 3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid (1b), which is essential for the deracemization reaction.</p><p>Then three commonly used chemical reductive agents, including sodium borohydride (NaBH4), sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3), and NH3•BH3, were incubated with 1b at pH 8.0 and 30 °C, respectively. As a result, 1b was successfully racemized to rac-1a. However, compared with NaBH4, NaCNBH3 and NH3•BH3 were milder and more water-stable in the preliminary experiments, which was consistent with previous reports <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> , and were selected for further research.</p><p>On the basis of the mechanistic studies, deracemization of rac-1a employing FsDAAO in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.

An initial set of experiments using purified FsDAAO in combination with 5-10 equivalents of NaCNBH3 was carried out for the deracemization of rac-1a (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, entry 1). The chiral HPLC analysis revealed that excellent optically pure (S)-1a (ee &gt; 99%) was obtained in 5 h, however, the conversion of (R)-1a to (S)-1a only reached 50-60%. In contrast to the results obtained using NaCNBH3, 4 equivalents of NH3•BH3 afforded conversion up to &gt; 96% thus made it ideal for our chemo-enzymatic deracemization process (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, entry 2). With these results in hand, we proceeded to investigate the deracemization of 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid derivatives employing the FsDAAO-NH3•BH3 cascade. As shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, racemic substrates 2a-4a were transformed into (S)-enantiomers at high conversions (up to &gt; 96%) and ee &gt; 99%. Compared with the alcalase-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution of the racemic ester <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[19]</ref> , the preparation of (S)-4a using this cascade was more attractive in terms of the enantioselectivity and reaction efficiency.</p><p>We also investigated the chemo-enzymatic deracemization of racemic 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (rac-5a) and its derivative (rac-6a). Substrate 5a was first tested with 8 equivalents of NH3•BH3. After 24 h of incubation, chiral HPLC analysis revealed that (R)-5a was completely oxidized, however, only 40% of (R)-5a was converted into (S)-5a (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>, entry 6). We speculated that the proposed oxidation product of (R)-5a, 1,4-dihydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (5b), may have been unstable and transformed into keto acid (5d) or enolic acid (5e), which subsequently led to low efficiency in the reduction process. To shed light on this process, we further analyzed the oxidative dehydrogenation product of (R)-5a using NMR and HR-MS. Unexpectedly, all of the data indicated that the final product was isoquinoline-3carboxylic acid (5c). On the basis of these results and the previous reports <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> , we proposed the FsDAAOcatalyzed oxidation and aromatization reaction (Scheme 2): (R)-5a was oxidized to 1,4dihydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (5b), followed by aromatization to produce isoquinoline-3carboxylic acid (5c). Scheme 2. Biocatalytic aromatization of (R)-5a.</p><p>To further improve the conversion, more reducing agent may be needed to ensure the immediate reduction of the intermediate 5b. Hence, 20 equivalents of NH3•BH3 were used to produce 75% conversion of (R)-5a to (S)-5a with excellent enantioselectivity (ee &gt; 99%). Unfortunately, only 28% of (R)-6a was converted to (S)-6a with relatively low ee (88%) using 40 equivalents of NH3•BH3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of Substrate Concentration on the Deracemization Reaction</head><p>The effect of substrate concentration on the deracemization reaction was studied to evaluate the potential of this chemo-enzymatic cascade (Table <ref type="table">4</ref>). The ratio of purrified FsDAAO to substrate was kept unchanged. 50 mM of 1a could be transformed into (S)-1a with high conversion (&gt; 98%) and excellent enantioselectivity (ee &gt; 99%) in 5 h. When the concentration of 1a was further increased to 60 or 100 mM, the conversion only reached 92% or 60% at 5 h, which was attributed to the slight insolubility of 1a at high concentration. Prolonging the reaction time could facilitate the improvement of conversion and ee 10.1002/adsc.201900178</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-course Studies of Kinetic Resolution and Deracemization Reaction</head><p>To understand the process of kinetic resolution and deracemization of carboxyl-substituted THIQs, timecourse studies were carried out with 50 mM of rac-1a or 40 mM of rac-5a using FsDAAO crude extract as a biocatalyst in an amplified reaction volume (20 or 30 mL). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>, the chiral HPLC analysis showed that (R)-1a or 5a were quickly transformed in the first 2 or 2.5 h, achieving complete conversion in the next 2 h, while the concentration of (S)-1a or 5a remained nearly unchanged. Excellent enantiomeric purity of (S)-1a or 5a (ee &gt; 99%) and high conversion (50%) were obtained in the kinetic resolution process.</p><p>In the process of chemo-enzymatic deracemization of rac-1a (Figure . 3A), after 2.5 h of incubation, 95% of (R)-1a was converted to (S)-1a in the presence of 4 equivalents of NH3•BH3 as the reducing agent, and the conversion reached up to &gt; 98% with ee &gt; 99%. For deracemization of rac-5a (Figure . 3B), 20 equivalents of NH3•BH3 produced 75% conversion of (R)-5a to (S)-5a within 4 h. After 6 h, 78% conversion was achieved with excellent enantioselectivity (ee &gt; 99%).  10.1002/adsc.201900178</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preparative-scale Deracemization of rac-1a and rac-5a</head><p>To demonstrate the synthetic capability of the investigated transformation, preparative-scale chemoenzymatic deracemization of rac-1a (500 mg) or rac-5a (400 mg) was performed in a 50 or 60 ml reaction system to produce enantiopure (S)-1a or (S)-5a at pH 8.0 and 30 °C. As expected, chiral HPLC showed that (R)-1a was almost completely converted into (S)-1a within 6 and 79% of (R)-5a was transformed to (S)-5a. (S)-1a and (S)-5a were finally obtained with good isolated yields (82% and 73%, respectively) and excellent enantioselectivity (ee &gt; 99%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In summary, we exploited a D-amino acid oxidase FsDAAO with excellent enantioselectivity toward the 1-and 3-carboxyl substituted THIQs while keeping a broad substrate scope. Using the recombinant FsDAAO as the biocatalyst, a general method for efficient deracemization of 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinoline carboxylic acids was developed that provides a complementary synthetic method to the preparation of chiral THIQs. Optically pure (S)-1a and 5a were obtained in good yields (82% and 71%, respectively) and with excellent enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). The FsDAAOcatalyzed deracemization is expected to provide access to the chiral carboxyl-substituted 1,2,3,4tetrahydroquinolines and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-ßcarbolines. Further protein engineering of the FsDAAO to modulate the enantioselectivity and expand the substrate scope is ongoing in our laboratory.</p></div>
