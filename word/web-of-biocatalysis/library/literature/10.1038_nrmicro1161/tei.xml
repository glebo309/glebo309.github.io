<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Metagenomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">1</ref> has the potential to substantially impact industrial production. The dimensions of the enormous biological and molecular diversity, as shown by Torsvik <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">2</ref> , Venter <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">3</ref> and their co-workers, are truly astonishing. A pristine soil sample might contain in the order of 10 4 different bacterial species. More than one million novel open reading frames, many of which encode putative enzymes, were identified in a single effort that sampled marine prokaryotic plankton retrieved from the Sargasso Sea.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>An industrial perspective</head><p>In this perspective, the discussion is limited to prokaryotes, as their genomes are most easily targeted by the functional screening tools available in metagenomics and because it is assumed, based on published literature, that the largest biodiversity occurs in the bacterial lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[6]</ref> . Different industries are interested in exploiting the resource of uncultivated microorganisms that has been identified through large-scale environmental genomics for several reasons detailed below.</p><p>The ideal biocatalyst. For any industrial application, enzymes need to function sufficiently well according to several application-specific performance parameters (FIG. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). With the exception of yeasts and filamentous fungi, access to novel enzymes and bio catalysts has largely been limited by the comparatively small number of cultivable bacteria. A corollary of this limitation is, however, that any application has to be designed with enzymatic constraints in mind, leading to suboptimal process and reaction conditions. Instead of designing a process to fit a mediocre enzyme, it is conceivable that the uncultivated microbial diversity, together with in vitro evolution technologies, might be used to find a suitable natural enzyme(s) that can serve as a backbone to produce a designer enzyme that optimally fits process requirements that are solely dictated by substrate and product properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">7</ref> .</p><p>Novelty. For industries that produce bulk commodities such as high-performance detergents, a single enzyme backbone with superior functionality that has an entirely new sequence would be useful to avoid infringing competitors' intellectual property rights. This problem is illustrated by the fact that substitutions at nearly every position in the mature 275 amino acid BPN (bacillus protease Novo type, from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens) subtilisin have been claimed in patents <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">8</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Maximum diversity.</head><p>The pharmaceutical and supporting fine-chemicals industries often seek entire sets of multiple diverse biocatalysts to build in-house toolboxes for biotransformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">9</ref> . These toolboxes need to be rapidly accessible to meet the strict timelines of a biosynthetic-feasability evaluation in competition with traditional synthetic chemistry.</p><p>Elusive metabolites. Many pharmacologically active secondary metabolites are produced by bacteria that live in complex CONSORTIA (see Glossary) or by bacteria that inhabit niches that are difficult to reconstitute in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">10</ref> . So, although there are reports on how to circumvent this general problem of microbial cultivation either by mimicking natural habitats <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">11</ref> or by allowing for interspecies communication after single cell micro-encapsulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">12</ref> , the cloning and heterologous expression of biosynthetic genes that encode secondary metabolites (usually present as gene clusters) is the most straightforward and reproducible method of accessing their biosynthetic potential.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Industrial enzyme applications</head><p>Enzymes are used in a wide range of applications and industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">13</ref> . They are required in only minute quantities to synthesize kilograms of stereochemically challenging chiral SYNTHONS that are used as building blocks to produce highly active pharmaceuticals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">14</ref> , and at a kiloton/year scale as active ingredients for bulk products such as high-performance</p><p>Activity Efficiency Specificity Stability Turnover frequency (k cat ) Temperature profile Specific activity (kat/kg, U/mg) pH profile Space-time yield Product inhibition Byproduct/ingredient inhibition Producibility/expression yield Temperature stability pH stability Ingredient/byproduct stability Solvent stability Substrate range Substrate specificity (K m , k cat /K m ) Substrate regioselectivity and enantioselectivity Substrate conversion (%), yield 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 5 6</p><p>laundry detergents <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">8</ref> . Their versatility allows their use in many applications, including processes to degrade natural polymers such as starch, cellulose and proteins, as well as for the REGIOSELECTIVE or ENANTIOSELECTIVE synthesis of asymmetric chemicals. Global industrial enzyme sales were estimated at $2.3 billion in 2003 REF. 15. The main profits were divided among detergents ($789 million), food applications ($634 million), agriculture/feed ($376 million), textile processing ($237 million), and pulp/paper, leather and other applications including enzymes for the production of fine and bulk chemicals ($222 million). In the face of soaring energy costs, dwindling fossil resources, environmental pollution and a globalized economy, the large-scale use of biotechnology instead of, or to complement, traditional industrial production processes, particularly in the chemical sector, is viewed as both an opportunity and a necessity. In the future, novel biotechnological applications should boost the market for industrial enzymes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>White biotechnology</head><p>The notion that environmentally sound, commercially viable biotechnological processes can take their respected place in a global industrial environment has been acknowledged for some time <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">16</ref> . Companies from Europe, Canada, Japan, South Africa and the USA reported on their experiences in processes as diverse as the production of acrylamide (Mitsubishi Rayon, Japan) and the use of enzymes in oil-well completion (British Petroleum Exploration, UK). Currently, the movement towards implementing sustainable technologies and processes is gaining momentum, particularly in Europe.</p><p>'Industrial' or WHITE BIOTECHNOLOGY is currently a buzzword in the European biobusiness community. The term was coined in 2003 by the European Association for Bioindustries (EuropaBio), based on a case study report, and it denotes all industrially harnessed bio-based processes that are not covered by the RED BIOTECHNOLOGY (medical) or GREEN BIOTECHNOLOGY (plant) labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">17</ref> . White biotechnology has its roots in ancient human history and its products are increasingly part of everyday life, from vitamins, medicines, biofuel and bioplastics to enzymes in detergents or dairy and bakery products. It is the belief of industrial promoters, analysts and policy makers that white biotechnology has the potential to impact industrial production processes on a global scale. The main long-term applications of white biotechnology will be focused on replacing fossil fuels with renewable resources (biomass conversion), replacing conventional processes with bioprocesses (including metabolic engineering) and creating new high-value bioproducts, including nutraceuticals, performance chemicals and bioactives.</p><p>Besides the involvement of the food, feed, detergent and politically heavilypromoted biofuel industries, it is the globally operating chemical and pharmaceutical industries that are riding this 'third wave of biotechnology' <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">18</ref> (a term illustrating the chronology of developments in which red and green biotechnology come first and second, respectively). As industries face increasing low-cost competition, particularly from East Asia, and political pressure to reduce their environmental impact and resource consumption to improve sustainability, it is felt that there is a strong need for smart and innovative technologies, processes and products to remain competitive.</p><p>The McKinsey consultancy predicts that, by 2010, biotechnology could be applied in the production of between 10% and 20% of all chemicals sold (amounting to a value of $160 billion) and that up to 60% of all fine chemicals (medium-volume products used as intermediates in the manufacturing of products such as pharmaceuticals, flavours, fragrances, agro-chemicals and detergents) might be produced using biotechnology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">17</ref> . Even for the traditional mainstay of the chemical industries, the polymer market (typical bulk-volume products), McKinsey predicts that biotechnology might account for up to 10% of the output.</p><p>The European Chemical Industry Council and EuropaBio have responded to a call from the European Commission, which asked for suggestions for ten central technological platforms, by proposing a 'European Technology Platform for Sustainable Chemistry' . White biotechnology will be one of three pillars of the platform, together with materials science, and reaction and process design. As a corollary, this triggered the nomination of sustainable chemistry as one of the thematic priorities in the European Union's seventh framework research programme, with the aim of strengthening the scientific and technological bases of European industry and encouraging its international competitiveness. Clearly, this joint European initiative does not come without 'stimulating' precedent from forward-looking international peers in the United States or Japan, and leading European stakeholders (among them DSM <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">19</ref> , Degussa, BASF, Henkel, Novozymes and Genencor) have urged policy makers to act to ensure a favourable competitive position. The promises of industrial biotechnology cannot be realized without coordinated and well-funded research and development (R&amp;D) efforts, a supportive and guiding political framework and early public involvement to pre-empt concerns over new Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> | Multi-parameter footprint analysis. This figure illustrates the ideal biocatalyst concept. Each enzyme candidate from the metagenome is ranked, from low (rating of 1) to high (rating of 6) using a specific set of criteria, to produce a multi-parameter fingerprint (shown in yellow). Criteria include in vitro enzyme activity, efficiency, specificity and stability. This decision matrix reveals the strengths and weaknesses of every candidate enzyme, so that the most promising candidate enzymes from diverse enzyme libraries can be selected for further process development by re-screening, protein engineering or directed evolution methods. kat, catalytic reaction rate; k cat , catalytic constant; K m , Michaelis constant; U, unit.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">©</formula><p>2005 Nature Publishing Group Primary screening In vitro evolution and enzyme engineering Secondary screening Scale-up application Sequence-basedscreening Application a Application b Activity-basedscreening Scale up Production of metagenomic library Application requirements and process constraints Enzyme libraryprecharacterized candidate set Enzyme candidates Pilot-scale process Enzymatic application biocatalytic process</p><p>technologies and generate the demand that industry requires for economic success <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">20</ref> . Whereas the food, feed and detergent industries typically concentrate on a limited number of enzyme reactions and substrates, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries deal with thousands of chemically and structurally diverse molecules, and production of each of these requires individual enzymatic solutions. Consequently, owing to a wealth of potentially useful biocatalysts, biotechnological applications of microbial resources are increasingly popular with the chemical industries and are viewed as indispensable for the modern organic chemist <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">21</ref> . With many successfully implemented processes operating worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">23</ref> and the number of industrialized biotransformations having doubled every decade since 1960 REF. 24, it is estimated that biocatalysis might provide a superior synthetic solution over classical chemistry in 10% of processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">25</ref> . In fact, the unavailability of an appropriate biocatalyst is thought to be a limiting factor for any biotransformation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">22</ref> .</p><p>So, there is ample demand for novel enzymes and biocatalysts, and meta genomics is currently thought to be one of the most likely technologies to provide the candidate molecules required <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">27</ref> . The diversity of potential substrates for enzymatic transformations in the fine-chemical industry and the short time that is usually available to propose viable synthetic routes (particularly for the pharmaceutical industry) make it useful to produce pre-characterized enzyme libraries using generic substrates, before screening for a specific enzyme that is required for biotransformation of a particular substrate of interest (FIG. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Screening for industrial enzymes</head><p>After Torsvik's seminal report in 1980 on the extraction and digestion of genomic DNA from bacterial samples prepared from soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">28</ref> and the proof of the concept for generating gene libraries directly from environmental DNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">29</ref>, it was only in the next decade that the first such metagenome libraries were reported. These were constructed from non-(PCR-)amplified genomic DNA fragments, isolated directly from marine plankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">30</ref> and from enriched consortia sampled from cellulose digesters <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">31</ref> . The research on the enriched consortia was particularly important, in that it describes the first successful expression screening of metagenomic DNA. Once this was achieved, the usefulness of the meta genome approach for biotechnology was clear. It was already evident that most environmental bacteria were recalcitrant to cultivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">32</ref> , but metagenomics meant that the biotechnological potential of these uncultivated bacteria might be accessible by directly cloning DNA sequences retrieved from the environment. To our knowledge, Diversa (San Diego, California, USA) and TerraGen Discovery (Vancouver, Canada, taken over in 2000 by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) were the first companies to file patents on specific aspects of metagenome technology in 1996. Diversa claimed methodologies to isolate and normalize environmental DNA prior to cloning and screening and described a resulting fosmid library created from marine picoplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">33</ref> . TerraGen's claims were focused on the retrieval of environmental DNA sequences from soil to express industrially relevant xylanases <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">34</ref> . Since then, several smallto medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have used uncultivated environmental microbial resources to retrieve relevant enzymes and biocatalysts. Most industrial metagenomic discoveries reported so far have been made by SMEs or academic groups collaborating Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> | Industrial enzymes -from the metagenome to applications and processes. This figure illustrates industrial rational bioprospecting of the metagenome. A library of cloned DNA is produced and primary screening, based on application requirements such as the conversion of an indicator substrate, produces enzyme libraries (different clones, which encode different enzymes, are indicated by different colours) that serve as platforms for subsequent development. Secondary screening of the enzyme library can identify process-specific properties such as substrate specificity, activity or stability. Primary and secondary screening both involve several stages based on different criteria, therefore the screening stages are multi-layered. Enzyme engineering and in vitro gene evolution can form a part of the development process. Subsets of cloned enzymes (red clones represent one subset, blue clones represent another subset) are then used in scale-up application or process testing to identify suitable enzyme candidates. Finally, process improvement by enzyme optimization and process engineering are carried out. Economic feasibility must be proven in a pilot-scale process environment as a prerequisite for scale-up to production or final application scale. Examples of the use of enzyme libraries in an industrial context include nitrilases <ref type="bibr">36</ref> (Diversa), alcohol dehydrogenases 9 (Schering Plough) and glycosylhydrolases 39 (BRAIN AG).</p><p>with larger companies, mainly in the chemical industry. Different methods for cloning environmental DNA and screening for enzymes or bioactive molecules have been devised by different companies. Only a few selected examples per company are mentioned in the following section.</p><p>Diversa, the largest and most prominent specialist biotech company for the commercialization of metagenome technologies, has described several approaches to access 'uncultivable' microorganisms. Applying a classical growth-selection-based expression strategy, diverse environmental libraries were constructed in Escherichia coli using phage λ and were screened for nitrile use. After growth in media containing nitriles as the sole nitrogen source, more than 100 new and diverse nitrilase genes were recovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">35</ref> . The resulting enzyme library is marketed to serve the fine-chemical and pharmaceutical industries <ref type="bibr">36</ref> . Besides target-gene-specific molecular enrichment strategies (see below), a technical focus is also placed on the sensitivity and throughput of screening by using cell-sorting technology <ref type="bibr">37</ref> . Diversa has partnered with several companies for the discovery and development of enzymes, among them DSM, Syngenta and BASF. Genencor International (Palo Alto, California, USA) teamed up with researchers from Göttingen University (Germany) to search for new dehydratases of potential use in the production of 1,3-propanediol from glucose, using a metabolically engineered strain of E. coli <ref type="bibr">38</ref> . Both sequence-based screens, targeting new genes that were related to known reference genes, and growth selection protocols, to screen for expressed and functional enzyme activity, were used. The German biotech company BRAIN AG (Zwingenberg, Germany) collaborated with the detergent manufacturer Henkel (Düsseldorf, Germany) to screen for novel glycosyl hydrolases for use in laundry applications <ref type="bibr">39</ref> , and with chemicals company Degussa (Düsseldorf, Germany) to use sequence-based screening strategies to clone novel nitrile hydratases <ref type="bibr">40</ref> .</p><p>Because of the ease of genetic manipulation of E. coli, combined with the availability of elaborate cloning and expression systems, most of the screens to date have used gene libraries constructed in this bacterium. However, the reported hit rates for the required targets vary between enzyme classes TABLE 1. This might be due to difficulties in expressing specific genes in E. coli, their scarcity in the metagenome pool or a combination of both. To overcome the potential limitations of expressing genes in E. coli,</p><p>Table 1 | Activity-based screening for industrially relevant enzymes and biocatalysts from metagenomic libraries Function Habitat Library type Average insert size (kb) Number of clones screened Library size (Mb) Substrate Number of hits Hit rate (hit per Mb) Ref.

However, this option is limited by the low throughput that is associated with alternative cloning hosts and serves mainly as an option for large-insert (&gt;30 kb) cloning, which is used in bioactive molecule discovery (see below and <ref type="bibr">TABLE 2)</ref>. A different strategy, whereby the abundance of target genes in the metagenomic DNA pool is increased through microbial enrichment using low concentrations of externally added nutrients prior to DNA extraction, has been pursued by the Icelandic biotech company Prokaria <ref type="bibr">41</ref> (Reykjavik, Iceland). Sequencespecific enrichments ('biopanning'), carried out either on the metagenomic input DNA prior to cloning or on the library after cloning in plasmid vectors, have been reported by Diversa <ref type="bibr">42</ref> .</p><p>In addition to new technologies to amplify DNA from limited resources using random primers and strand-displacing DNA polymerase from phage Φ29 REF. 43, a strategy promoted by Lucigen (Middleton, Wisconsin, USA), it is clear that current mass-sequencing efforts in several laboratories will facilitate the in silico identification of open reading frames that might encode potentially useful enzymes <ref type="bibr">44</ref> . Another interesting approach for a focused, high throughput screening system, substrate-induced gene expression screening (SIGEX), was recently applied to isolate catabolic enzymes from a groundwater metagenome <ref type="bibr">45</ref> . Environmental DNA was cloned upstream of a plasmidborne promoter-less gfp (green fluorescent protein) reporter gene in E. coli. Substrate (benzoate or naphthalene)-induced expression of GFP in recombinant cells was used to identify and isolate (by fluorescence activated cell sorting, FACS) single cells carrying metagenomic inserts (catabolic operons) with substrate-responsive promoters and associated downstream enzymes that were subsequently shown to convert the inducer substrates to products.</p><p>Once new genes are cloned and screened for activity, the main stumbling block is the expression of pure protein in sufficient amounts at reasonable costs. A cheap and efficient enzyme, usually produced in efficient expression systems like bacilli or filamentous fungi, is a key factor for success, particularly when the enzyme functions as part of the final (bulk) product such as in detergents. In the fine-chemical industry, this might be similar for bulk product synthesis. Particularly in the pharmaceutical industry, the time taken for a target compound to come to the market is decisive, and in these applications it might be even more important for a company to have a large collection of biochemically diverse catalysts, even if these molecules are not expressed in large amounts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Searching for bioactive molecules</head><p>Despite large increases in the R&amp;D expenditure of big and medium-sized Pharma, the number of pharmacologically active 'new chemical entities' (NCEs) has not increased proportionally <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">46</ref> , and this is most notable in the paucity of new antibiotics. Big Pharma currently find antibiotics economically unattractive to develop for various reasons when compared with drugs to treat longterm chronic conditions like obesity and high cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">47</ref> . This could have dramatic consequences for the global antibiotic resistance problem. Natural compounds and their derivatives will continue to have an important role in drug discovery, as they have done in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">48</ref> -natural products constituted 63% of all newly approved antiinfectives between 1983 and 1994 REF. 49. Many natural products are bacterial and fungal secondary metabolites, but as most microorganisms cannot easily be cultivated, it is probable that many potentially active compounds have never been characterized. Metagenomics might have an invaluable role in the discovery process of new bioactive molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">51</ref> . For this reason, metagenomes have attracted the attention of academia and specialized pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>TerraGen Discovery <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">53</ref> first incorporated PCR-amplified microbial-soil-metagenome genes into incomplete polyketide synthase clusters present in a recipient Streptomyces strain to show the usefulness of functionally cloning and expressing environmental genes as part of a host cell's secondary metabolite biosynthetic machinery. In a second step, the same researchers reported the production of novel bioactive metabolites (which were patented as terragines) after cloning metagenomic DNA fragments in a Streptomyces lividans host using E. coli shuttle cosmid vectors. This approach addressed two important issues of using heterologous expression systems to obtain useful amounts of pharmacologically active, naturally occurring secondary metabolites. First, it is important to choose an appropriate expression host. S. lividans is an actino mycete, a family of high GC-content Gram-positive bacteria that devote large proportions of their genomes to biosynthetic genes that synthesize considerable amounts of secondary metabolites. Therefore, an actinomycete expression host is more likely than E. coli to provide the necessary genetic, biochemical and physiological background to produce bioactive molecules from genes that are derived from uncharacterized bacteria which are also thought to be members of this taxonomic lineage. This, however, might change in the future, as successful attempts to metabolically engineer E. coli to improve its use as a cloning and production host for complex secondary metabolites (for example, 6-deoxyerythronolide B, an antibiotic precursor) have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">54</ref> . Second, this study showed the importance of developing high-capacity vectors and suitable transformation protocols to accommodate the large gene clusters that are involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis (TABLE <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). Similar strategies were used by researchers from Aventis Pharmaceuticals 55 (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which addressed the cloning-vector capacity and expression host issues by designing bacterial artificial chromosomes that could be used for cloning metagenome DNA in E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">56</ref> , Streptomyces and Pseudomonas strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">57</ref> (key members of this research team have since joined ActivBiotics of Lexington, Massachusetts, USA). These endeavours were paralleled by efforts to extract large clonable DNA fragments (mainly from soil). This work was supported by European biotech company BRAIN AG, collaborating with researchers from the University of Darmstadt, Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">58</ref> , and BioSearch Italia (Gerenzano, Italy; recently rebranded as Vicuron Pharmaceuticals), collaborating with the University of Warwick, UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">59</ref> . Through examination of the patent literature, it seems that Diversa is using similar methods for the discovery of small molecules using direct cloning <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">60</ref> .</p><p>So, the obvious potential of the metagenomic approach for drug discovery has been realized by companies around the world. Whereas in the recent past, SMEs engaged in metagenomic research for the sake of anti-infectives discovery, other uses for bioactive molecules in cancer therapy and other medical fields will probably lead companies that are currently engaged in red biotechnology to use metagenomics as its potential unfolds <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">61</ref> .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metagenomics -an industrial future</head><p>As the excitement about genetic access to the boundless realms of microbial diversity slowly gives way to the reality of tapping into this diversity, the usual challenge of heterologous gene expression needs to be addressed to turn metagenomic technologies into commercial successes, particularly in applications for which bulk enzyme or product quantities have to be produced at competitive prices. Metagenomics, together with in vitro evolution and high-throughput screening technologies, provides industry with an unprecedented chance to bring biomolecules into industrial application. That this is possible has been shown by Diversa. A full cycle from the discovery of novel molecular scaffolds from multiple resources, including metagenomes, to in vitro evolution technology to generate an improved biocatalyst for a specific application was realized to produce α-amylases for applications in the hot and acidic process of starch liquefaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">62</ref> , showing the feasibility of the 'ideal biocatalyst' concept.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_3"><head>Table 2 | Activity-based screening for antimicrobial metabolites from metagenomic libraries</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Producer colonies identified by production of a pigment.
