      "text": "iochemists and microbiologists have long seen biocatalysis as an area with great promise for chemical synthesis, but industrial applications have been modest. In this review article we sketch the current state of industrial biocatalysis in several European industries and look ahead to new processes that are likely to develop, based on current academic and industrial research. Two parallel developments are apparent in industry: chemical industries are hiring increasing numbers of life scientists, and organic chemists are beginning to embrace biocatalysis as a tool in new and difficult syntheses. This will lead to more industrial applications of biocatalysts. Work during the past decade has shown that there are surprisingly few barriers to the use of enzymes and whole cells as biocatalysts in organic synthesis 1,2 . Isolated enzymes are typically used for hydrolytic or isomerization reactions. Whole cells are often used for synthetic reactions that require cofactors which must be regenerated, because although cofactor regeneration in vitro is possible, it is generally easier and less expensive to regenerate cofactors in metabolically active cells. Both isolated enzymes and whole cells are used in industry today, and are an active area of research. Enzymes are remarkable catalysts: capable of accepting a wide array of complex molecules as substrates, and exquisitely selective, catalysing reactions with unparalleled chiral (enantio-) and positional (regio-) selectivities. As a result, biocatalysts can be used in both simple and complex transformations without the need for the tedious blocking and deblocking steps that are common in enantio-and regioselective organic synthesis. Such high selectivity also affords efficient reactions with few by-products, thereby making enzymes an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical catalysts. These attributes have resulted in myriad applications, especially in the food and pharmaceutical industries where high reaction selectivity on complex substrates is critical. Examples include the production of high-fructose corn syrup, by the action of xylose isomerase 3 which catalyses the isomerization of D-glucose to D-fructose, and the preparation of semisynthetic penicillins catalysed by penicillin amidase 4 . Selective catalysis is now also becoming a requirement for the chemical industry, and recent advances in enzymatic catalysis have been extended to the synthesis of speciality chemicals and polymers 5,6 and of some bulk chemicals. For example, peroxidases are used industrially to catalyse the synthesis of phenolic resins for use as replacements of conventional phenol-formaldehydes 7 , and nitrile hydratase is used to catalyse the hydration of acrylonitrile into acrylamide 8 . In both cases, nearly quantitative conversion of the reactants into products is obtained and under reaction conditions far milder than their chemical counterparts. Most commercial enzymatic processes today share several attributes, including high product concentrations and productivities, no undesirable by-products, and enzymes that do not require expensive cofactors. Future biocatalytic processes generally will not be limited by the available technology or the nature of the substrates and the products. Instead, the feasibility of new biocatalytic processes will often be determined by the availability of the biocatalyst, the search for which is described in the accompanying papers in this issue by Walsh (pages 226-231), Arnold (pages 253-257) and Khosla and Harbury (pages 247-252). Consequently, a growing number of companies sees biocatalysis as an interesting option. As individual industries develop relevant experience, industrial biocatalysis will grow rapidly.",

In the laboratory, new biocatalytic reactions often originate with new enzyme activities. For applications, a more rational approach is needed. The starting point will usually be a product, which can perhaps be produced by one of several possible biocatalytic reactions that convert suitable substrates to the desired product. Figure 1 illustrates the development of such biocatalytic processes. One or more biocatalysts must be identified or developed, a process must be set up, and the resulting bioconversion will ultimately have to be economically feasible. The development of such a process requires the input of many different specialists. Limiting aspects of the biocatalytic process are improved in an iterative manner, gradually leading to an efficient industrial process. In setting priorities for improvements at each process step, a detailed understanding of the costs and improvement potential of each of the partial steps in a process is vital. The economic feasibility of a biocatalytic process depends on several factors (Fig. 1). Depending on the type of biocatalyst to be used, specific reactor and hardware configurations are needed (summarized in ref. 9). In addition, biocatalytic processes are typically highly heterogeneous. In theory, this would necessitate specific designs of the catalyst-hardware interface 10 . But in practice, a limited number of hardware designs is found today in large industrial processes, allowing the application of biocatalysts based on only a few concepts. In analogy to chemical processes, most biocatalysts are used in immobilized form as heterogeneous catalysts that can be recovered and reused. There are also processes, however, based on homogeneously suspended cells or enzymes, that are sufficiently inexpensive to permit single use, without recovery or reuse. In fact, several speciality chemical companies now use living cells as catalysts for reactions such as specific coenzyme-dependent oxidoreductions, as described below.",

      "text": "The rapid growth of biocatalysis is a direct result of research and development in two key technologies: protein engineering, including molecular evolution 11,12 , and enzyme engineering. Whereas the former provides enzymes with altered structure, function and selectivity, particularly in aqueous media, the latter, especially involving engineering of the enzyme microenvironment, provides striking improvements in nonaqueous environments. Indeed, it is now well known that enzymes do function in organic solvents, and many in neat (pure) solvents or in supercritical fluids in the absence of added water (see refs 13-15 and review in this issue by Klibanov, pages 241-246). Such an environment yields many potential advantages, including higher substrate solubility, reversal of hydrolytic reactions and modified enzyme specificity, which result in new enzyme activities that previously were only possible using genetic modifications or complex multistep pathways within whole cells. As a result, applications of enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents range from chiral resolution of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and their intermediates 16 to enantio-and regioselective polymerization 17 . Despite the advantages of nonaqueous conditions for biocatalytic transformations, enzymes nearly universally display low catalytic activities in these environments compared with native aqueous solutions. Nonetheless, recent developments have shown that biocatalysts can be engineered to function in neat organic solvents with activities and selectivities that are consistent with their aqueousbased counterparts. For example, subtilisin Carlsberg suspensions (subtilisin and other enzymes are insoluble in nearly all organic solvents) prepared simply by lyophilizing an aqueous preparation (see review by Klibanov, pages 241-246) in the presence of nonbuffer salts 18 yield rate enhancements of more than 20,000-fold 19 . The mechanism of this activation has not been elucidated, although it is strongly dependent on the specific salt used. Specifically, kosmotropic (order-promoting) salts are expected to stabilize the folded form of enzymes during the lyophilization process as well as in the nonaqueous reaction medium, thereby leading to higher enzymatic activities in such solvents 20 . In addition to subtilisin, a number of other enzymes are activated by this technique, including those with very different catalytic mechanisms. Activation has also been achieved by the addition of crown ethers 21 , transition-state analogues 22 , and substrates and substrate mimics 23 . Activated biocatalyst preparations have found direct application in the pharmaceutical industry, where salt-activated biocatalysts have been used to synthesize a library of paclitaxel (taxol) derivatives 24 . The bacterial protease thermolysin was found to acylate selectively the 2፱-hydroxyl of taxol in t-amyl alcohol (Fig. 2). Yields of the 2፱-acyl derivatives approached 100% using KCl-activated thermolysin. For the specific acylation with divinyladipate, a taxol 2፱-vinyladipate was generated, which served as the acyl donor for Candida antarctica lipase-catalysed hydrolysis of the terminal vinyl ester. The resulting taxol 2፱-adipic acid derivative was nearly 1,700 times more soluble in water than the native taxol, a result of critical importance in the design of taxol prodrugs with increased bioavailability. In the presence of low concentrations of a suitable surfactant, enzymes are able to dissolve in hydrophobic organic solvents, where they remain remarkably active and with secondary and tertiary structures nearly identical to that measured in water 25 . For example, in peptide synthesis, subtilisin Carlsberg and Ȋ-chymotrypsin were over 1,000-fold more reactive than their native suspended counterparts in suitable organic solvents. Solubilized enzymes have been used to generate 'biocatalytic plastics' (Fig. 3), wherein enzymes are incorporated into growing vinyl polymers to yield homogeneous immobilized preparations 26,27 . This technique enables the biocatalyst to be used in a form suitable for a specific function. Thus, suspension polymerization could be used to yield biocatalytic plastic beads of controlled sizes, for example as catalysts in packed-bed reactors. Thin-film formation could be pursued to give biocatalytic paints, coatings and films for applications ranging from antifouling coatings (for example to prevent surface protein and cell adhesion) to affinity materials for use in the synthetic, diagnostic and medical arenas. The development of 'solvent-free' systems has become of interest recently as a more environmentally benign technique for catalysing reactions that cannot be performed in aqueous solutions. For example, enzymatic polyester synthesis has been performed in neat solutions of diols and diesters 28 . Rapid polymer growth is obtained with nearly quantitative conversions.",

      "text": "A number of potentially interesting biocatalytic conversions being investigated today involve apolar substrates and products, such as aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic compounds. Such compounds are generally insoluble in water, and often they are toxic to whole cells [29][30][31] . Thus they cannot simply be added to an aqueous medium for whole-cell transformation. Several technical solutions to this problem have been developed. One promising approach is to use two-liquid-phase media: an aqueous phase that contains the growing cells, and an apolar solvent that contains the substrate and newly formed product [32][33][34] . Biocatalysis in emulsions is a well established technology in research laboratories [35][36][37] and is expected to be equally applicable on larger scales [38][39][40] . Moreover, solvent-based processes enable the use of well established, industrial downstream-processing techniques. For two decades from the 1970s these systems were used with various catalytically active natural hosts, often pseudomonads, but lately recombinants harbouring genes for appropriate enzymes are gaining ground. Although not particularly solvent-resistant, Escherichia coli has been used effectively as a biocatalysis host. Examples include the oxidation of alkanes 34,35 , aromatics such as toluene and styrene derivatives 41 , and heterocycles 42 . A related engineering approach for processes based on multiphase reaction media is gas-phase biocatalysis 43 . Enzymes or intact cells form a solid phase and reactants are dissolved in the gas phase. This concept is suitable for reactants that can be brought into the gas phase at operating conditions, and has the advantage of simple downstream processing and efficient mass transfer, while the use of toxic or inhibiting solvents can be avoided. A third approach to handling toxic compounds is to feed these into the bioreactor at limiting rates, so that such substrates are transformed without first accumulating, thus maintaining very low and non-toxic substrate concentrations. Products can be removed essentially instantaneously by continuous extraction techniques, either in suitable apolar solvents or by adsorption onto solid beds 44 . These techniques have now matured to a point where they can be used routinely to carry out whole-cell biotransformations on a wide range of substrate-product combinations. Perhaps surprisingly, E. coli may well be the preferred host. Such transformations are limited only by the availability of the required enzyme systems. If these can be found (from available strains, screening or selection) or generated (by protein engineering or directed evolution), a suitable whole-cell biocatalyst can be constructed 41,45 . By using highly water-insoluble solvents such as hexadecane, two-liquid-phase systems can be developed that contain 10-50% (by volume) apolar phase in an aqueous medium, and cause no damage to the E. coli host 39,46,47 . Recombinant strains can be grown to densities of 10-40 g l ǁ1 (dry mass), either in batch, fed-batch or continuous-cultivation systems 30 international units (micromoles converted per minute) per litre of aqueous medium, and these activities can be maintained for 10-20 hours 48,49 . These numbers lead to space-time yields of 5-25 tons of product per cubic metre aqueous medium per year, for typical small molecules with relative molecular masses of 100-200. Higher numbers might be reached, based on enzyme activities of 30-100 international units per gram cell (dry mass) and cell densities of 10-20 g l ǁ1 (ref. 48). Other parameters would, however, then become limiting, such as the practical volumetric energy and oxygen input and the heat removal capacity that can be achieved in large-scale industrial reactors.",

They consist primarily of fatty-acid chains, which are linked by ester bonds to an alcohol or polyol backbone. Lipases belong to a large class of enzymes that hydrolyse the ester bond between the fatty-acyl side chains and the lipid backbone. Understanding the catalytic cycle of lipases has been of significant importance to their widespread use in different biotechnological applications. The lipase active site is composed of three different residues: serine, histidine and aspartate or glutamate. The hydrolysis of an ester involves an acyl enzyme complex. The catalytic cycle starts by nucleophilic attack of the hydroxyl group of the serine side chain on the carbonyl carbon atom of the ester bond. The complex is resolved by the nucleophilic attack of water, the fatty acid is liberated and the enzyme is regenerated (Fig. 4). As lipases are active in organic solvents, water can be replaced by other nucleophiles such as alcohols. The result of this reaction is a transesterification. For racemic alcohols only one enantiomer may be acylated, thereby leading to enantioselective transformations (see accompanying reviews in this issue by Walsh, pages 226-231, and Koeller and Wong, pages 232-240). Suitable acyl donors are vinyl esters, anhydrides or diketene. The reaction is irreversible and the separation of the remaining alcohol and the newly formed ester is simple. This principle is now used in many reactions to produce enantiomerically pure alcohols. BASF has recently extended its chiral synthesis capabilities to the enzymatic resolution of racemic alcohols. Some of the core technologies at BASF, such as condensation or hydrogenation of ketones, give access to the racemic starting compounds. A broad range of enantiomerically pure alcohols can now be offered (Fig. 5a). Amines might also be used as nucleophiles 55 . Racemic amines are efficiently resolved using ethylmethoxyacetate as acylating agent (Fig. 5b). Using ethylmethoxyacetate the initial reaction rate is more than 100 times faster compared with butylacetate. The reason for this activating effect of the methoxy group is probably an enhanced carbonyl activity induced by electronegative Ȋ-substituents.

The nucleophilic attack on carbonyl functionalities serves as target for reaction engineering approaches. characterize this new process, which has been used by BASF since 1993. The products, the R-amide and the S-amine, can be recovered and separated by distillation and have high chemical and optical purities. The above process is applicable to a broad spectrum of amines, which are of considerable interest as chiral building blocks or as auxiliaries for the syntheses of bioactive ingredients. Several chiral amines (Fig. 5b) are now being produced in scales up to several hundred tons in a multiproduct facility. BASF is building a secondgeneration plant using this new technology, which is due to begin production in 2001 and will be operated according to cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice) standards. Another optically active amine that will be produced by this process is S-methoxyisopropylamine. It is a building block for the optically active corn herbicide Frontier x2. A dedicated plant for this amine will go on-stream in mid-2001 with an annual capacity of 2,000 tons. For the success of lipases as industrial biocatalysts it has been important that they be available in commercial quantities, highly stable and active in organic solvents, and that they have a broad substrate range. Besides their usefulness in the production of alcohols and amines, lipases can be used for other reactions. For example, enolesters can be stereoselectively protonated and other reactions such as the cleavage of oximesters, C-C bond formation and synthetic Michael reactions (the nucleophilic addition of a carbanion to an Ȋ,ȋ-unsaturated carbonyl compound) may be achievable. But significant further improvements are necessary to facilitate these reactions 56 .",

The 6-APA core structure can be extended by chemical means or by the action of an enzyme to a core structure suitable for synthesis of semisynthetic cephalosporins, such as 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA; 8 in Fig. 6c).

This required 800 or 2,000 m 3 of bioreactor volume (continuous and batch processes respectively), as well as a processing unit for phase separation, distillation of substrate and product from the carrier solvent, and final separation of product from substrate (also by distillation). The estimated cost distribution was as follows: equipment depreciation and maintenance, 18-22%; substrates and solvents, 20%; energy, 10%; waste handling, 5%; personnel, 2%. The single major expenditure comprised medium salts and the carbon source (glucose), which accounted for 40% of all costs owing to the limited biocatalyst activities and lifetimes. A first estimate of whole-cell process feasibility can be based simply on the volumetric activity and catalyst stability that can be expected for a given (recombinant) whole-cell biocatalyst. The rule of thumb is that for products valued at less than US$20 per kg, the intended production should exceed 1,000 tons per year and volumetric activities should be above 100 international units per litre to warrant further work. For the present time, biocatalytic processes will therefore undoubtedly be developed for products compatible with costs greater than US$20-30 per kg. But the above numbers demonstrate that there is significant scope for improvement by increasing biocatalyst activity and stability. This reduces medium costs, as well as the size of the fermentation equipment necessary for given production runs. Synthesis of products with values in the range of US$5-10 per kg may be feasible, and attempts to develop major products (50,000 tons per year or more) with values of US$2-5 per kg may be worth considering. Although research on improved, multiphase bioconversion technology will be useful, it is the biocatalysts that present the most interesting target for improvement. Development of appropriate activities and selectivities enable biocatalytic processes in the first place, and improvements of activity and stability may make a process economically feasible. Thus it is not surprising that research efforts, both for whole-cell systems and isolated enzymes, have focused on improving enzyme properties such as substrate range and specificity, stability and, most interestingly, function in non-classical environments.",

The combination of catalyst engineering with directed evolution and gene-shuffling techniques will yield enzymes with tailored selectivities and synthetically relevant activities in essentially any suitable reaction medium. Increasing the stability of enzymes at solid interfaces and films and coatings 82 will result in more active and stable immobilized biocatalysts and biocatalytic materials for use in both aqueous and nonaqueous media. More active and stable enzymes at surfaces will enable protein-based chips 83 and nanomaterials to be developed for use in proteomics, functional genomics and microfluidic biocatalysis. Finally, miniaturized biodevices may be combined with combinatorial biocatalysis 84 to generate libraries of biologically relevant compounds available for rapid screening. The high selectivity of enzymes for chemical-compound library synthesis enables a broad array of natural products and complex synthetics to be derived efficiently using biocatalysts. The mild reaction conditions and high selectivity of biocatalysts are critical for the generation of pharmacologically useful libraries from these lead compounds 85 . Combinatorial biocatalysis goes beyond drug discovery, and many of the same techniques used in pharmaceutical synthesis can be used to generate libraries of agrochemicals, biopolymers, nutra…",

      "text": "From a process-engineering perspective, biocatalysts may be coenzyme dependent (such as oxidoreductases) or coenzyme independent (such as hydrolases). Coenzymes such as the pyridine dinucleotides (for example, NAD(P)H) or phosphorylated trinucleotides (such as ATP) are expensive and must be recycled. In vivo coenzyme recycling systems have been well established on the laboratory scale during the past two decades 86 . This approach is also used on the industrial scale where it is most easily achieved with intact and metabolically active cells as biocatalysts. Highly efficient in vitro coenzyme recycling methods have been developed and have enabled the use of isolated oxidoreductases on the laboratory scale (see refs 87 and 88 for reviews). An outstanding application on the industrial scale is the production of L-t-leucine in a membrane reactor by Degussa with enzymatic recycling of NADH using formate/formate dehydrogenase 89 . Recently, Clair and co-workers (ref. 90) reported a promising new approach for recycling of NADH in a crystalline preparation of horse-liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH-CLEC). Crosslinking of enzyme crystals significantly stabilized the enzyme activity for two days in up to 90% polar organic solvents such as isopropanol. HLADH-CLECs were used in a small packed-bed reactor for the reduction of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, with butanediol as the source of reduction equivalents and a calculated turnover number for NADH of 12,000. Electrons can be supplied to oxidoreductases by electrochemical methods. For example, rhodium complexes have been used to channel electrons to NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases, resulting in highly specific reduction of NAD + (refs 91, 92). Mediator proteins have also been used 79 . Attempts to avoid the use of labile and expensive pyridine nucleotides by using artificial redox mediators such as viologens or anthraquinone derivatives have been described for C-H bond-forming oxidoreductases derived from anaerobic microorganisms 93 . A new in vitro regeneration system for ATP has been described recently 94 . Here, the ATP-dependent formation of glucose-6-phosphate from glucose was achieved by coupling polyphosphate:AMP phosphotransferase and adenylate kinase. This allowed the in situ formation of ATP from AMP with phosphate groups derived from inexpensive polyphosphate.",
