Moreover, the use of an immobilized enzyme permits to greatly simplify the design of the reactor and the control of the reaction [3][4][5][6][7]: the simple filtering of the enzyme stops the reaction; it is possible to use any kind of reactor, etc. Thus, immobilization is usually a requirement to the use of an enzyme as an industrial biocatalyst, and is the simplest solution to the solubility problem of these interesting biocatalysts. However, the idea of enzyme reuse implicitly means that the stability of the final enzyme preparation should be high enough to permit this reuse. Therefore, the enzyme needs to be very stable or to become highly stabilized during the immobilization process to be a suitable process. Thus, although there are hundreds of immobilization protocols [3][4][5][6][7], the design of new protocols that may permit to improve the enzyme properties during immobilization is still a exciting goal. Moreover, bearing in mind that the final use will be as industrial catalyst, the ideal immobilization processes should limit the use of toxic or highly unstable reagents, be very simple, robust, etc.",

      "text": "Immobilization of enzymes inside the porous structure of a solid may permit to have the enzyme molecules fully dispersed and without the possibility of interacting with any external interface. Thus, this immobilization will stabilize the enzyme against interaction with molecules from the enzymatic extract, preventing aggregation, autolysis or proteolysis by proteases from the extract (that will be also dispersed and immobilized). Moreover, the immobilized enzyme molecules will not be in contact with any external hydrophobic interface, such as air bubbles originated by supplying some required gases or promoted by strong stirring, necessary to control pH. These gas bubbles may produce enzyme inactivation of soluble proteins [19][20][21][22], but cannot inactivate the enzymes immobilized on a porous solid [23,24] (Fig. 1). In the presence of an organic solvent phase, the immobilized enzymes may be in contact with the molecules of solvent which are soluble in the aqueous phase, but not with the organic phaseinterface, preventing this inactivation cause again. Thus, any immobilization protocol of an enzyme which yields the enzyme immobilized inside a porous solid as the final product may permit an \"operational stabilization\" of the enzyme, even without really affecting the structural stability of the enzyme, simply by the mechanisms described above. However, this stabilization is not universally associated to the immobilization. For example, the increasingly popular use of non-porous nano-particles (mainly magnetic nano-particles) to immobilize enzymes [25][26][27] needs to consider that all the mechanisms of enzyme stabilization described above are lost in this case: enzymes immobilized on nano-particles are now able to interact with external interfaces, or even with enzyme molecules immobilized on other particles. This may be solved by using proper strategies (e.g., covering the immobilized proteins with polymers) [28] (Fig. 1).",

If the support is formed by very thin fibers, e.g., smaller than the protein, it will hardly be possible to get an intense interaction between the enzyme and the support. • The support should present a high superficial density of reactive groups. Only if there many reactive groups in the support under the protein surface, an intense multipoint covalent attachment may be achieved. • The reactive groups in the protein and the support should present minimal steric hindrances in the reaction, because after the initial immobilization, multipoint covalent attachment requires the contact between groups bound to rigid structures. • The reactive groups in the support should react with groups frequently placed in the enzyme surface. • The reactive groups involved in the immobilization should be stable enough to permit long enzyme-support reaction periods. • It should be easy to get a final inert surface in the support after immobilization, by destroying or blocking the remaining reactive groups in the support without affecting the enzyme. Among the immobilization protocols described in literature, there are some that may fulfill most of these requirements. Supports like agarose beads, zeolites, porous glass, epoxy resins like Sepabeads, offer large areas for enzyme-support interactions. Among the reactive groups, epoxy or glyoxyl groups may be considered very adequate [30,31]. Glyoxyl agarose has the additional advantage that directs the immobilization via the richest area(s) in reactive residues of the protein, enabling intense multipoint enzyme-support reaction [32,33]. Glutaraldehyde chemistry is other popular technique to immobilize enzymes. It has given some good stabilization factors in many instances [34][35][36]. The glutaraldehyde technique is very versatile and may be used in very different fashions [37][38][39]. However, in terms of stabilization, the treatment with glutaraldehyde of proteins previously adsorbed in supports bearing primary amino groups offers in many cases very good results, because permit the crosslink between glutaraldehyde molecules bound to the enzyme and glutaraldehyde molecules bound to the support.

Immobilization conditions should favor the enzyme-support reaction [30,41]. Some of these critical variables are: • Reaction time. Although immobilization may be very rapid, multipoint interaction between the non-complementary enzyme and support surfaces is a slow and time-dependent process: it requires the correct alignment of groups located in the already immobilized, and partially rigidified enzyme, and the rigid surface of the support. • pH value. Although immobilization may be performed at neutral pH value in many cases, incubation at alkaline pH values, where the reactivity of the nucleophiles of the protein (usually Lys) may be improved, is convenient to reach a high enzyme-support reaction. It should be kept in mind that while terminal amino groups may have a pK between 7 and 8, exposed Lys groups will present a pK over 10.5. • Temperature. Moderately high temperature may favor the vibration of enzyme and support, increasing the possibilities of getting more enzyme-support linkages. • Buffers. It should be chosen buffers that do not interfere in the reaction. For example borate may interfere in the aldehyde-amine reaction; amino compounds (Tris, ethanol amine) may modify epoxy supports or compete with the Lys by aldehyde groups [30]. • Inhibitors or other protein protectors.

      "text": "One specific problem in the design of a biocatalyst is if the enzyme is a multimeric one. The inactivation of these enzymes starts, in many instances, by the dissociation of the enzyme in its individual subunits [87]. Even if this is not relevant for enzyme stability, the release of enzyme subunits may contaminate the final product (e.g., a food). Stabilization of multimeric enzymes by genetic engineering may be too complex, leaving the immobilization or the chemical modification as the simplest strategies to solve the dissociation problem of oligomeric proteins. However, in this case the immobilization-stabilization strategy should consider this multimeric nature of the enzyme, pursuing not only the multipoint attachment of the protein, but also the multisubunit attachment. The ideas behind will be very similar to the previously described for the multipoint covalent attachment. Thus, the multimeric structure of dimeric enzymes may be easily stabilized by immobilization on highly activated supports [88]. Some successful examples of this strategy obtained in our laboratory are: d-amino acid oxidases from Trigonopsis variabilis and Rodotorula gracilis [35,51], formate dehydrogenases from Pseudomas sp. and Candida boidini [24,70], alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver [68] (Fig. 3). However, if the enzyme structure is more complex, it is quite likely that not all the subunits of the enzyme may be attached to a plane surface. In these, cases multisubunit immobilization on pre-existing solid supports may be complemented by chemical crosslinking with polyfunctional-polymers of the already immobilized enzyme [88] (Fig. 4). In our laboratory we have been able to stabilize many complex multimeric enzymes following this two-step strategy, e.g., catalase from bovine liver or Thermus sp. [52,53] ampicillin acylase from Acetobacter turbidans [89], Asparaginase [90], beta-galactosidase from Thermus sp. [86], alcohol oxidases from P. pastoris and Hansenula sp. [91]. If the immobilization is produced by reaction between enzyme molecules like crosslinked crystal enzyme (CLECs) [92], crosslinked enzyme aggregates [93] (CLEAs), etc., they may be a good option to get immobilized enzymes with a stabilized multimeric structure, although there are not many examples on this [94].",

      "text": "As commented in Section 1, the enzyme specificity should be very high against the natural substrate, but this value may be significantly reduced when the enzyme is intended to be used against compounds that are far from that natural substrates. In this case, the improvement of the enantioselectivity may be a critical requirement to get an industrially relevant process. Among the many tools to improve the enzyme selectivity (e.g., protein engineering or directed evolution [107][108][109][110]), again it is possible to find the protein immobilization as a powerful technique. Immobilization of a protein may produce some distortion on the active site, reducing the overall mobility of the protein groups. Moreover, enzymes that suffer great conformational changes during catalysis could have these changes distorted when immobilized, producing immobilized enzymes with fully altered catalytic properties. The requirement to utilize the possibilities of this distortion is to be able to access to a large battery of supports to immobilize proteins and of immobilization protocols that may permit to control the immobilization. This may permit the immobilization of a protein via different regions, conferring different rigidity and distorting the enzyme in very different ways, it may be even possible to generate different micro-environments around the enzyme bearing very different physical properties. That way, this may permit to achieve a large library of immobilized enzymes, perhaps with very different properties. As stated above, lipases suffer very large conformational changes during catalysis [95][96][97][98]. Thus, these enzymes were chosen to develop this idea. In fact, the strategy has been very successful in the modulation of the enantiopreference of many lipases [111][112][113][114][115][116][117][118][119][120][121][122][123][124][125][126][127][128][129]. It has been reported that the same lipase immobilized on different supports may exhibit very different enantioselectivity (in some cases even an inversion being detected) in the same experimental conditions. In some cases, the change in the experimental conditions can present an effect fully opposite on different immobilized preparations [110][111][112][113][114][115]. Table 3 shows some of the most relevant results obtained in our laboratory with some of the most used lipases, in the alteration of the lipase enantiopreference by using different immobilization techniques, in the hydrolysis of several racemic compounds (Scheme 1). Enantiomeric ratio may be changed from 1 to almost 100 just by using different immobilized preparations in some cases. In some instances (e.g., methyl mandelate and CRL [114]) it was even possible to obtain both pure isomers by using different immobilized preparations. A further step was showing that the same lipase immobilized on the same support and used under the same conditions, may behave in a very different fashion depending on the immobilization conditions. This required the immobilization protocol to be able to immobilize proteins in a wide range of conditions and, in certain extent, to fix the different structure of the lipase during immobilization. This was exemplified using lipase from Candida antarctica (form B) and its adsorption on a support coated with polyethylenimine, at different temperatures from pH 5 to 9 [130]. The use of PEI-coated support permitted Scheme 1. Enantioselective hydrolytic resolution of different racemic compounds catalyzed by immobilized lipases. to immobilize the enzyme in all these range of pH value. The interactions with the polymer of the different forms of the lipases, permitted to keep, at least partially, the different forms of the lipase molecule. Thus, enantioselectivity was varied from 3.5 to 25 just by adsorbing the enzyme under different pH and T values [130]. Other examples of modulation of the enzyme catalytic properties via immobilization techniques may be found. Penicillin G acylase is another enzyme that suffers a relatively large conformational change during catalysis, an acyl-induced exposition of the reactive serine [131]. The properties of this enzyme have been also modulated by immobilization, both in synthesis of antibiotics [132,133] and in resolution of racemic mixtures [134]. Similarly, the selectivity of multimeric enzymes, where the subunit assembly may play a critical role in the final properties, has been altered by immobilization techniques: betagalactosidase from E. coli [135] or ampicillin acylase from A. turbidans [89], getting preparations with different features. However, these results show another aspect: this kind of enzymes will alter its properties during immobilization even if it is not desired, and the use of just one random immobilization technique may produce an immobilized form with similar, worse or better properties than the soluble enzyme. If the enzyme naturally presents the desired properties, it is necessary to keep them unaltered during the immobilization. For these cases, it is necessary to use extremely mild immobilization protocols, preventing any undesired restriction to the enzyme mobility or distortion of the active center. In this regard, immobilization on supports bearing lowly activated aldehyde dextran may be a very good alternative [136]: this long and hydrophilic spacer arm produces a minimal modification on the enzyme. We should consider that most of the immobilization strategies available will immobilize proteins by the areas that were the richest one in one kind of group, but a protein may have several areas very rich in a determinate group (Lys, in negative charges, in positive charges). Therefore, in many cases we can have a main orientation of the enzyme, but we can hardly assure that we have got just a unique orientation of the enzyme. However, even using this imperfect strategy, we have observed an extremely strong modulation of the enzyme properties when comparing enzymes immobilized on different supports. Thus, if it was possible to have all the protein molecules immobilized following exactly the same orientation, results may be expected even to be more significant. Therefore, the development of methodologies that could permit to immobilize enzymes in a fully controlled fashion, exactly via a particular area and conferring a desired rigidity, will greatly improve the potential of this technique to modulate the enzyme properties. This way, there is still a hard and exciting way ahead before exploring the possibilities of these methodologies. Therefore, controlled immobilization of enzymes may be a very powerful and simple tool to modulate enzyme properties, with results such as those obtained using other techniques (e.g., directed evolution). In any case, all the technologies should be compatible, and this \"combinatorial\" preparation of biocatalyst may be performed on engineered proteins. There is a recent report where a possible robotization of the system to coupling side directed evolution and immobilization modulation is proposed by immobilizing enzymes in microtiter plate scale [137]. This strategy, although empiric, may permit in a very rapid fashion, using a collection of enzymes immobilized following a battery of supports under different conditions, to find a biocatalyst able to perform a particular resolution of a chiral compound, with quite high possibilities.",
      "snippet": "As commented in Section 1, the enzyme specificity should be very high against the natural substrate, but this value may be significantly reduced when the enzyme is intended to be used against compounds that are far from that natural substrates. In this case, the improvement of the enantioselectivity may be a critical requirement to get an industrially relevant process. Among the many tools to improve the enzyme selectivity (e.g., protein engineering or directed evolution [107][108][109][110]), again it is possible to find the protein immobilization as a powerful technique. Immobilization of a protein may produce some distortion on the active site, reducing the overall mobility of the protein groups. Moreover, enzymes that suffer great conformational changes during catalysis could have these changes distorted when immobilized, producing immobilized enzymes with fully altered catalytic properties. The requirement to utilize the possibilities of this distortion is to be able to access to a large battery of supports to immobilize proteins and of immobilization protocols that may permit to control the immobilization. This may permit the immobilization of a protein via different regions, conferring different rigidity and distorting the enzyme in very different ways, it may be even possible to generate different micro-environments around the enzyme bearing very different physical properties. That way, this may permit to achieve a large library of immobilized enzymes, perhaps with ve…",

As examples of the potential of these techniques, the hydrolysis of lactose by two different lactases will be discussed. Lactase from Kluyveromyces lactis presents competitive inhibition by galactose (χ was 45 mM) and non-competitive by glucose (χ was 750 mM) [143]. Using soluble enzyme, this inhibition constants were enough to stop the reaction of hydrolysis of 5% lactose (similar to the content in milk) after an 80% hydrolysis [143]. After immobilizing the enzyme on different supports, a immobilized preparation with a much higher inhibition constant by galactose (χ was over 40 M) was obtained and this preparation permitted the full hydrolysis of 5% lactose. Lactase from Thermus sp. presented even a stronger competitive inhibition by galactose (χ 3.1 mM) and non-competitive inhibition by glucose (χ was 50 mM), the reaction of hydrolyses of 5% lactose was apparently stopped just at 60% of conversion [144]. The immobilization on different supports permitted to find one preparation where the χ by glucose were increased by a two-fold factor, while the competitive χ by galactose increased by a four-fold factor. These changes in the kinetic constants permitted, also in this case, the full hydrolysis of 5% lactose [144]. Thus, although this problem may be also reduced using genetic tools [145] immobilization may also solve or reduce it with a similar or even higher efficiency.",

The chemical and genetic amination of the surface of some enzymes (e.g., glutaryl acylase, penicillin G acylase) have permitted to greatly improve the multipoint covalent attachment of the enzyme, increasing the stability of the immobilized enzyme when compared to the immobilized native one [154][155]. In a similar way, chemical and genetic modification of the protein surface has improved the reversible adsorption of penicillin G acylase on both, cationic and anionic exchangers [156][157]. A final nice approach that we would like to comment on has been the use of directed evolution to improve the activity recovery and stability of the enzyme after immobilization. In two cycles of an error-prone PCR process, variants of formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii were created which preserved 4.4-fold higher activity after entrapment in polyacrylamide gels than the wild-type enzyme [158]. Therefore, the use of site-directed mutagenesis of protein surfaces seems to be a powerful tool to greatly improve the control of the immobilization and the properties of the final immobilized biocatalyst, and more effort may be expected in the next years in this regard.",
