<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_2MzAJQQ"><p xml:id="_Gs6D6wg">ABSTRACT: Enzymes as catalysts in synthetic organic chemistry gained importance in the latter half of the 20th century, but nevertheless suffered from two major limitations. First, many enzymes were not accessible in large enough quantities for practical applications. The advent of recombinant DNA technology changed this dramatically in the late 1970s. Second, many enzymes showed a narrow substrate scope, often poor stereo-and/or regioselectivity and/or insufficient stability under operating conditions. With the development of directed evolution beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, all of these problems can be addressed and generally solved. The present Perspective focuses on these and other developments which have popularized enzymes as part of the toolkit of synthetic organic chemists and biotechnologists. Included is a discussion of the scope and limitation of cascade reactions using enzyme mixtures in vitro and of metabolic engineering of pathways in cells as factories for the production of simple compounds such as biofuels and complex natural products. Future trends and problems are also highlighted, as is the discussion concerning biocatalysis versus nonbiological catalysis in synthetic organic chemistry. This Perspective does not constitute a comprehensive review, and therefore the author apologizes to those researchers whose work is not specifically treated here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_6B6aDzS">SELECTED MILESTONES OF THE PAST</head><p xml:id="_AD84YnZ">Humans have utilized enzymes for thousands of years in the form of fermentation as a means to produce and preserve foodstuffs such as cheese, beer, vinegar, and wine. In more modern times it was Louis Pasteur who in 1858 placed a milestone in biocatalysis by treating an aqueous solution of racemic tartaric acid ammonium salt with a culture of the mold Penicillium glaucum, leading to the consumption of (+)-tartaric acid and concomitant enrichment of the (-)-enantiomer. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> This can be considered to be a forerunner of enzyme-catalyzed kinetic resolution as it is widely practiced today in academia and industry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Pasteur's publication was followed by Emil Fischer's monumental carbohydrate research which culminated in the lock-andkey hypothesis of stereoselective enzyme catalysis in 1894. <ref type="bibr">3a</ref> One hundred years later Albert Eschenmoser 3b and Friedrich Lichtenthaler 3c wrote enlightening essays which illuminated the impact of Fischer's hypothesis on modern chemistry, biochemistry, and immunology. Linus Pauling's hypothesis regarding the stabilization of transition states of enzyme-catalyzed reactions 4a is an extension of Fischer's idea, as is Daniel Koshland's induced fit model. <ref type="bibr">4b</ref> Another cornerstone of biocatalysis was laid by Eduard Buchner who in 1897 reported the successful fermentation of sugar by cellfree yeast extracts, which constitutes indisputable proof that biological transformations do not necessarily require living cells. <ref type="bibr">5a</ref> This paradigm shift opened the door to modern biocatalysis including fermentation technology for the production of a vast array of achiral and chiral products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> As noted by Lothar Jaenicke, 5b Buchner's contribution was recognized by another master of organic chemistry at the time, Adolf von Baeyer, who stated that "This will make him famous, even if he doesn't have any talent for chemistry."</p><p xml:id="_SM4j3yK">In the first half of the 20th century scientists in academia and industry learned how to use whole cells, cell extracts, or partially purified enzymes in various biocatalytic processes. In what can be called the beginning of modern enzyme-mediated asymmetric catalysis, Ludwig Rosenthaler described in 1913 the preparation of (R)-mandelonitrile (3) by treating benzaldehyde (1) with HCN (2) in the presence of emulsin extracted from bitter almonds (a mixture of enzymes including oxynitrilase). <ref type="bibr">6a</ref> Today both R-and S-selective oxynitrilases are commercially available which catalyze the asymmetric cyanohydrin formation of a variety of structurally different aldehydes and ketones (enantiomeric excess (ee) &gt; 95%). 6b,c These are useful starting materials in the synthesis of numerous chiral products as demonstrated by Franz Effenberger and others. <ref type="bibr">2,6b,c</ref> Yet another landmark that likewise set the stage for present day research and technology concerns the use of microbial strains that catalyze the regio-and stereoselective oxidative hydroxylation of steroids, as first demonstrated in the early 1950s by such pharmaceutical companies as Upjohn, Schering, Pfizer, and Merck. A key example is the oxidative hydroxylation of readily available progesterone (4) to the 11α-product 5 by Rhizopus arrhizus or Aspergillus niger strains, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> a compound that was easily transformed into such important commercial products as cortisone and hydrocortisone by chemical means (the latter with inversion of configuration at C11). Later it was shown that oxidations of this kind involve selective catalysis by cytochrome P450 enzymes. <ref type="bibr">2,7b</ref> The combination of biocatalytic and chemical synthetic steps offered a practical alternative to Robert B. Woodward's 1952 landmark 40-step synthesis of hydrocortisone. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref> In the mid-1950s Vladimir Prelog began his seminal studies on the use of microbial strains as catalysts for the stereoselective reduction of ketones 6 (L = large; S = small), which ultimately led to the Prelog rule, a mnemonic device for predicting the stereochemical outcome of such reactions. 9a Subsequently the relevant enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenases, were isolated, structurally characterized, and used in vitro as catalysts in asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones. <ref type="bibr">2,9b</ref> Today a number of Prelog and anti-Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases are commercially available. Due to the high price of NAD(P)H, cofactor regeneration systems had to be developed for practical applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Techniques for isolating and purifying enzymes were optimized in the middle of the 20th century, which were then employed as biocatalysts in stereoselective transformations of unnatural substrates. Nevertheless, these early examples were more or less isolated cases which were ignored by most organic chemists. The pace of methodology development regarding biocatalysts in synthetic organic chemistry gradually increased in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, parallel to advances in uncovering the mechanisms of various classes of enzymes as well as elucidating biosynthetic pathways. Only a few of many prominent pioneers are named here, and the reader is referred to full accounts elsewhere. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> For example, the groups of Brian Jones, Klaus Kieslich, Maria-Regina Kula, and George Whitesides, among others, published seminal work which helped to popularize enzyme catalysis, although at the time many synthetic organic chemists remained skeptical. An impressive example was provided by the Whitesides group describing the use of an aldolase as the catalyst in stereoselective aldol addition of ketone 9 to aldehydes 8 with stereoselective formation of adducts 10. 10 Synthetic nonbiological chiral catalysts rivaling aldolases as catalysts in these kinds of aldol reactions have not been developed to date.</p><p xml:id="_YaMTBAX">Another important contribution was made by Alexander Klibanov, who showed that enzymes such as lipases retain some (but not all) of their activity in organic solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">11</ref> This proved to be particularly important in those transformations which are problematic in aqueous media, e.g., lipase-catalyzed stereoselective formation of chiral esters, the stereogenic center being either in the alcohol or the acid portion of the esterification products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2." xml:id="_Cs87NVv">THE ADVENT OF RECOMBINANT DNA METHODS</head><p xml:id="_2Zdrvcc">A serious problem in enzyme catalysis persisted until the end of the 1970s, namely how to obtain proteins in sufficient quantities for practical applications in a general manner. Traditionally, enzymes were isolated from their respective sources, these being microorganisms, fungi, insects, plants, or mammalian species. However, this was often tedious, and in many cases reasonable amounts were not accessible. This long-standing limitation constituted one of the major obstacles to generalizing biocatalysis in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology. The breakthrough, catalyzed by the work of Paul Berg, Herbert Boyer, and Stanley Cohen, came with the development of recombinant DNA methododology, according to which a given enzyme occurring in one organism can be overexpressed in another host organism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">12</ref> Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are typical host organisms.</p><p xml:id="_QYa9wMu">In this way large quantities of enzymes became accessible, sometimes in ton amounts, an example being protein-based detergents produced by such companies as Henkel (Germany) or Novozyme (Denmark). In some cases enzymes cannot be expressed in the usual bacterial hosts, therefore requiring the development of alternative expression systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Biotechnological engineering of reactors, enzyme immobilization, and methods for the optimization of downstream workup contributed heavily to making biocatalysis practical and industrially viable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) developed by Kary Mullis in 1983 rapidly emerged as an indispensable tool in molecular biology, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">14</ref> its use in protein engineering being one of many areas of application.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3." xml:id="_XyzJX2a">SELECTED EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES BASED ON ENZYMES</head><p xml:id="_2YECQ5e">By the 1990s many enzymes were commercialized, and a number of industrial processes were operating, most often for producing fine chemicals such as chiral compounds required in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, plant protecting agents, and fragrances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> Numerous fermentation processes for obtaining chiral compounds in enantiomerically pure form had also been established, e.g., in the large-scale production of L-amino acids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> The monograph by A. Liese, K. Seelbach, and C. Wandrey illustrates numerous industrial applications of enzymes up to 2006 by including informative reaction flow-sheets and the applied reactor technology. 13a Other reviews likewise dispel myths regarding biocatalysis. 13b-g One of numerous examples is the BASF process for the production of chiral amines in enantiomerically pure form. <ref type="bibr">15</ref> Racemic amines such as rac-11 are acylated with methoxyacetic acid ethyl ester (12), an appropriate lipase serving as the catalyst in kinetic resolutions characterized by very high selectivity factors (E &gt; 200), depending upon the particular structure of the starting amine. 15 More recently a system for performing dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral amines using a racemizing Ru catalyst in combination with a lipase was developed by Backvall et al. which has the important advantage of enabling full conversion and high enantioselectivity, 16a similar to the prior development of dynamic kinetic resolution of chiral alcohols and diols. <ref type="bibr">16b,c</ref> The advantages of dynamic kinetic resolution using other enzymes have been reported by Faber et al. in a number of studies which greatly enrich synthetic organic chemistry. <ref type="bibr">16d</ref> The same holds true for biocatalytic deracemization procedures.</p><p xml:id="_J33ptSZ">16d-f Journal of the American Chemical Society Perspective dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja405051f | J.

The Japanese plant operates at a capacity of 4 × 10 5 tons/year. 2a,17a Lonza (Switzerland) uses a nitrile hydratase to convert 3-cyanopyridine into nicotinamide (6 × 10 3 tons/year). <ref type="bibr">2,17b</ref> 4. TRADITIONAL LIMITATIONS OF ENZYMES AS CATALYSTS IN SYNTHETIC ORGANIC CHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY Despite these successes, enzymes as catalysts in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology continued to suffer from the following traditional limitations, namely the often observed</p><p xml:id="_GzwzjVE">• insufficient stereoselectivity • poor regioselectivity • narrow substrate scope (or low rate)</p><p xml:id="_qJgmtJN">• insufficient stability under operating conditions • product inhibition These long-standing drawbacks not only limited the application of enzymes in a practical way but also resulted in a (psychological) barrier in the minds of many organic chemists regarding biocatalysis in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5." xml:id="_2e4N8Aa">EARLY ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND THE UTILITY OF</head><p xml:id="_YqcAruM">ENZYMES Many attempts at solving at least some of the above problems were undertaken in the 1980s. Rational design based on sitespecific mutagenesis, a genetic method introduced in 1978 by Michael Smith for replacing a given amino acid in a protein by one of the other 19 canonical representatives, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">18</ref> paved the way for manipulating the structure and catalytic properties of enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19</ref> Rational design proved to be (partially) successful in studies aimed at enhancing the thermostability of proteins. <ref type="bibr">19,20a,b</ref> Amino acid substitutions were designed which led to new intramolecular H-bonds on the protein surface, thereby helping to prevent undesired unfolding upon heat treatment. Site-specific mutagenesis for improving stereoselectivity, a more challenging task, was shown to be successful in some cases, <ref type="bibr">19,20c,d</ref> but due to the complexity of enzymes, generalization has not been accomplished to date. Some researchers in the 1980s generated libraries of mutants using mutating chemical agents, mutator strains, or even genetic methods and screened these for enhanced thermostability or activity. <ref type="bibr">21</ref> However, a second mutagenesis/screening cycle, which would have exerted "evolutionary pressure", was not considered (with one exception). <ref type="bibr">21d</ref> In the mid-1980s the first examples of catalytic antibodies were published independently by Richard Lerner and Peter Schultz, which sparked a flurry of activities toward a possible alternative to enzymes. <ref type="bibr">22</ref> Many fascinating studies of a variety of reaction types have appeared. <ref type="bibr">22d</ref> Nevertheless, generalization to the point of real practical applications of these protein-based catalysts has not been achieved. Most of them are quite sensitive. Moreover, the mechanism of an immune system in which the antibodies are produced involves binding properties, not catalysis. Optimal binding requires shape complementarity but not necessarily activating effects in the respective transition states necessary for low-energy reaction pathways in catalysis. Therefore, the activity of catalytic antibodies is generally low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6." xml:id="_PVz2cpV">THE ADVENT OF DIRECTED EVOLUTION</head><p xml:id="_Ev32Gx4">Today all of the problems listed in section 4 can be addressed by applying a different protein engineering technique called directed evolution (or laboratory evolution). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">23</ref> It involves repeating cycles of gene mutagenesis, expression, and screening (or selection) of mutant enzyme libraries in an overall process which simulates natural evolution. The most common gene mutagenesis methods for generating mutant libraries are</p><p xml:id="_6kMjCZd">• error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR)</p><p xml:id="_MdzWK3C">• saturation mutagenesis • DNA shuffling Since epPCR targets the whole gene and therefore the entire protein, it is a kind of shotgun method, although amino acid bias exists. <ref type="bibr">19,24a</ref> It is the most often used technique and does not require structural information about the enzyme. In a seminal study published by Frances Arnold in 1993, several rounds of epPCR were applied in order to increase the robustness of the protease subtilisin E toward the hostile solvent dimethylformamide. 24b Later this approach was extended by many groups to include the enhancement of thermostability using epPCR and other genetic techniques. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">25</ref> As synthetic organic chemists, my group became interested in laboratory evolution back in 1995 because we wanted to control a catalytic parameter which is at the heart of modern organic synthesis, namely stereoselectivity. As schematized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, it is a logical strategy for generating enzyme mutants as catalysts in asymmetric transformations. <ref type="bibr">26</ref> Each cycle exerts evolutionary pressure on enantioselectivity, the experimenter targeting either the desired R-or the S-product on an optional basis. At the outset it was not clear whether directed evolution would be sensitive enough to be successful in this endeavor. Moreover, assaying thousands (or more!) of mutants for enantioselectivity posed yet another problem, because methods for determining so many ee values did not exist at the time. Several medium-and high-throughput ee-screening systems were developed, examples being UV/vis-based systems using plate readers for 96-well microtiter plates (∼700 samples/ day) 26a or the more expensive multiplexed MS-based assay utilizing isotope-labeled substrates (up to 10 000 exact ee values/day). 27a No single screening system is universal, but fortunately today a variety of different ee assays are available, including automated GC and HPLC. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> In 1997 proof-of-principle of this new approach to asymmetric catalysis was provided for the first time, 26a the lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa serving as the catalyst in the hydrolytic kinetic resolution of the chiral ester rac-16 with preferential formation of (S)-17. Wild-type (WT) lipase is only marginally S-selective, the selectivity factor amounting to only</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E = 1.2.</formula><p xml:id="_TsTcyJr">Four rounds of epPCR at low mutation rate with the introduction of a single point mutation in each generation improved enantioselectivity to E = 11 (S) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Shortly thereafter other genetic methods were applied, resulting in notably improved mutants (see below). <ref type="bibr">26b</ref> This Darwinian approach to creating catalysts for asymmetric transformations in organic chemistry is f undamentally dif ferent f rom techniques traditionally used in designing and synthesizing chiral transition metal catalysts or organocatalysts. As delineated in section 7, this initial example set the stage for numerous subsequent studies employing essentially all major types of enzymes: hydrolases, reductases, oxidases, transferases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases (formation of C-C, C-O, C-S, or C-N bonds), progress up to 2004 being summarized elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">19,23,26c</ref> In contrast to epPCR, oligonucleotide-based saturation mutagenesis involves combinatorial randomization at predetermined sites, a given site comprising one or more residues in the enzyme. <ref type="bibr">19,23,26b,d</ref> Traditionally, this entails the introduction of all of the 20 canonical amino acids at an appropriately chosen site with formation of focused mutant libraries. Today the so-called QuikChange protocol from Stratagene is routinely used which is based on numerous previous studies (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">28</ref> Simply speaking, the genetic information encoding the mutational changes is registered in the designed primers (appropriate oligonucleotides) which are prepared (commercially) and subsequently introduced into a plasmid.</p><p xml:id="_kVY29sE">When applying saturation mutagenesis, a choice regarding the optimal randomization sites has to be made. When targeting stereo-or regioselectivity, substrate scope, and/or rate, sites around the enzyme's binding pocket constitute logical choices. The first example of an enantioselective mutant enzyme generated by saturation mutagenesis at a site lining the binding pocket concerns the aforementioned lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of rac-16, in which a four-residue site in the lipase PAL was randomized followed by the screening of 5000 transformants. 26b This resulted in the discovery of an S-selective mutant (E = 30). Later a convenient acronym was introduced to describe such a procedure, CAST ("combinatorial active-site saturation test"). <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Sites comprising one or more amino acid positions are identified on the basis of the X-ray structure or homology model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). It is a way to reshape the "lock" in Emil Fischer's lock-and-key hypothesis. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Guidance by bioinformatics such as the consensus approach which had  previously been used for protein thermostabilization 30a can be helpful. 30b,c As delineated in section 7, the real power of this strategy begins when using it in the form of iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM).</p><p xml:id="_jGWkwJg">Saturation mutagenesis can also be applied when aiming to enhance protein thermostability or resistance to denaturing organic solvents, in this case B-factors from X-ray data being necessary. Those residues having the highest average B-factors, reflecting maximum flexibility, are chosen for saturation mutagenesis iteratively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">31</ref> The overall process, called B-FIT, is an alternative to conventional approaches based on epPCR, DNA shuffling, or rational design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">25</ref> A final gene mutagenesis method featured here is DNA shuffling, introduced in 1994 by the late Pim Stemmer, who used a β-lactamase as the model enzyme in the successful attempt to increase its activity. 32a Several versions including family shuffling are possible. 32b Homologous genes encoding the respective enzymes are first digested with a DNase to yield double-stranded oligonucleotide fragments generally defined by 10-50 base pairs, which are amplified by PCR. Repeated cycles of strand separation and reannealing by an appropriate DNA polymerase followed by final PCR amplification ensure the reassembly of full-length mutant genes. The case of shuffling mutants prepared previously by some procedure is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>. Synthetic shuffling was also developed, in which designed DNA fragments are first prepared separately and subsequently assembled into full length genes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19</ref> By 2004, directed evolution had emerged as a general method for optimizing the stereoselectivity of enzymes. <ref type="bibr">26c</ref> In most cases epPCR and DNA shuffling were the mutagenesis methods of choice, saturation mutagenesis playing only a minor role. The lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution of rac-16 served as a platform for comparing different approaches. At that time the combination of high error rate epPCR, DNA shuffling, and selected saturation mutagenesis led to a mutant of P. aeruginosa lipase having a selectivity factor of E = 51 (S) in the kinetic resolution of rac-16, a procedure that required the screening of about 50 000 transformants. <ref type="bibr">26b</ref> Reversal of enantioselectivity in favor of (R)-2 was also achieved (E = 30). <ref type="bibr">26c</ref> Other prominent examples include the directed evolution of stereoselective aldolases, 33 Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases, 34 nitrilases, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">35</ref> and monoamine oxidases. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> In an early study regarding the aldolase KDPG as a catalyst in the reaction of 19 with 20, several rounds of epPCR and DNA shuffling provided a mutant characterized by four point mutations (T84A, I92F, V118A, and E138V) showing perfect control of diastereoselectivity in the formation of 21, which is a precursor of the sugar 22. 33a Directed evolution has since pervaded the entire area of aldolases in a synthetically intriguing manner. <ref type="bibr">33c</ref> The reaction shown here and numerous other examples demonstrate the complementarity of biocatalysis and catalysis using transition metal complexes or organocatalysts.</p><p xml:id="_BFBfqrK">Two industrial examples of laboratory evolution are also highlighted here, further examples covering the period up to 2004 and 2008, respectively, being reviewed elsewhere. <ref type="bibr">26c,27c</ref> The first case concerns the directed evolution of a nitrilase as a catalyst for the desymmetrization of the prochiral dinitrile 23 with formation of (R)-24 as reported by scientists at Diversa (Verenium). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">35</ref> The product is an intermediate in the synthesis of the cholesterol-lowering pharmaceutical Lipitor (25).

Genomic libraries from environmental samples were first screened for this transformation, and on a small scale a nitrilase showing 94.5% ee in favor of (R)-24 was discovered. However, when the reaction was performed at a concentration of 2.25 M necessary in a practical process, activity was strongly reduced, indicating product inhibition. Saturation mutagenesis was applied at all 330 amino acid positions individually, the respective 330 mutant libraries being screened with an MS assay 27a using 15 N-labeled substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">35</ref> After screening about 32  000 transformants, more than a dozen hits were identified.

This elegant de-racemization strategy is an alternative to the BASF lipase-based process for obtaining enantiomerically pure or enriched amines 15 (section 3). Moreover, the procedure works very well even for chiral secondary and tertiary amines, which is an impressive achievement not readily possible using other technologies. 36c,d</p></div>

The chosen randomization sites A, B, C, etc. around the binding pocket are subjected to saturation mutagenesis with the creation of first generation focused libraries. A hit from one library is then used as a template for randomization at the other sites, and the process is continued until all sites have been visited once in a given upward pathway. The simplest case is a two-site ISM system with two pathways A → B and B → A, respectively, but three-and foursite systems featuring 6 and 24 different upward pathways, respectively, have also been used (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). Thus, CASTing in the form of ISM is a systematic approach to reshaping the binding pocket of an enzyme, in contrast to earlier studies in Journal of the American Chemical Society Perspective dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja405051f | J. Am. Chem.

Thus far, arbitrary choices were made in more than two dozen successful studies, suggesting that such decisions are not crucial. Nevertheless, these questions are the focus of current research, and one trend is apparent: It is more efficient to choose sites comprising more than one amino acid position, which raises the question of oversampling in the screening process. 23a This statistical issue has been addressed 23a,41b,42 using the Patrick-Firth statistical algorithms 42a as incorporated in the computer aid CASTER which is useful in the design of saturation mutagenesis libraries (available free of charge on the author's homepage, <ref type="url" target="http://www.kofo.mpg.de/de/forschung/organische-synthese">www.kofo.mpg.de/de/forschung/  organische-synthese</ref>). The degree of oversampling for covering 95% of a given library depends upon the number of residues in a site and upon the chosen codon degeneracy, the latter defining the (reduced) amino acid alphabet. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">43</ref> When using NNK codon degeneracy (N = adenine/cytosine/guanine/ thymine; K = guanine/thymine) encoding all 20 canonical amino acids, it can be seen that the number of transformants that need to be screened for essentially full library coverage increases dramatically as the number of residues in a site increases (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>). In contrast, when using a reduced amino acid alphabet such as NDT codon degeneracy (D = adenine/ guanine/thymine; T = thymine) encoding only 12 amino acids (Phe, Leu, Ile, Val, Tyr, His, Asn, Asp, Cys, Arg, Ser, Gly) as building blocks in the randomization process, the screening effort is reduced notably, truly drastic effects occurring when using even smaller alphabets. <ref type="bibr">23a,30b,41b</ref> In experiments using an enantioselective epoxide hydrolase designed for testing the virtues of NNK versus NDT codon degeneracy, the identical number of transformants were screened in both cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">43</ref> The use of NDT codon degeneracy led to notably higher library quality, meaning a higher frequency of hits and superior catalyst performance in terms of evolved enantioselectivity.

This means that the inf luence of mutations in ISM-based directed evolution is notably more than additive, i.e., nonadditive in a synergistic manner. The importance of cooperative and antagonistic nonadditivity as opposed to "classical" mathematical additivity in directed evolution and in other areas of protein engineering has been analyzed in a recent review. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">49</ref> A universal problem in all of directed evolution occurs whenever a mutant library along a given evolutionary pathway fails to harbor an improved enzyme variant, irrespective of the mutagenesis method. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">23</ref> In such situations the experimenter can screen more transformants (mutants), turn to a different mutagenesis technique, or give up. In a recent ISM study focusing on the enantioselectivity of an epoxide hydrolase in which all 24 pathways of a four-site system were explored, intriguing discoveries were made. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">50</ref> It was found that 16 of the 24 pathways are energetically favored in the fitness landscape with no local minima (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). In the other eight cases, local minima were encountered; i.e., the respective libraries did not contain any mutants showing enhanced enantioselectivity. In these cases a counterintuitive decision was made by choosing an inferior mutant in that library as the template in the subsequent ISM step. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">50</ref> In all cases this procedure proved to be a successful way to escape from local minima! It is reminiscent of the neutral drift theory 51a as propagated by Dan Tawfik and others and/or the quasi species hypothesis of Manfred Eigen  and Peter Schuster for explaining natural evolution, 51b which have been invoked by Bengt Mannervik in protein engineering studies of glutathione transferases. <ref type="bibr">51c</ref> Since the lipase-catalyzed hydrolytic kinetic resolution of rac-16 is the most systematically studied transformation in directed evolution (section 3), it was essential to test ISM in this model system. 52a With the help of the X-ray structure of the P. aeruginosa lipase, 52b six residues were identified for saturation mutagenesis, these being grouped into three sites: A (Met16/ Leu17), B (Leu159/Leu162), and C (Leu231/Val232) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>). Pathway B → A proved to be most prolific (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">9</ref>), providing a triple mutant Leu162Asn/Met16Ala/Leu17Phe with a selectivity factor of E = 594 (S). Site C was not visited because enantioselectivity and activity as shown by enzyme kinetics were already so high. <ref type="bibr">52a</ref> The initial libraries in two other pathways contained no improved mutants, but attempts to escape from the local minimum were not undertaken due to the success of pathway B → A. This study allowed the rigorous comparison of ISM with previously applied gene mutagenesis strategies.

ISM has also been used to enhance protein robustness, e.g., by applying the B-FIT method or, when multimeric enzymes are involved, by performing surface engineering as demonstrated by Matthias Bechtold et al. 75f (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>).

LESSONS LEARNED FROM DIRECTED EVOLUTION Two types of lessons are possible when performing laboratory evolution, provided thorough theoretical analyses flank the experimental work. One kind of insight results when studying the origin of enhanced activity, stereoselectivity, or thermostability. The analyses using biophysical methods, ideally in conjunction with QM/MM, not only unveil the factors responsible for improved catalytic performance but also help researchers to understand the intricacies of enzyme mechanisms in general. A rare example in which X-ray structural data of a stereoselective mutant were included concerns the protein engineering of an enantioselective epoxide hydrolase evolved in five ISM steps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">79</ref> Using this information in combination with enzyme kinetics, inhibition experiments, molecular dynamics simulations, and docking experiments, light was shed on the molecular change occurring in the binding pocket at each evolutionary stage. In the case of applying ISM to the limonene epoxide hydrolase as a catalyst in the desymmetrization of cyclopentane oxide, <ref type="bibr">55</ref> Fahmi Himo applied a QM-based cluster approach to model enantioselectivity at all mutational stages of the respective R-and S-selective pathways, which proved to display high predictive power. <ref type="bibr">55b</ref> Another case concerns the QM/MM study by Walter Thiel et al. regarding the origin of stereoselectivity of a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase and mutants thereof produced by epPCR. 80a Whereas Chris Walsh and others had previously uncovered the general mechanism of these enzymes 81a and synthetic organic chemists had used them for decades, 81b,c only mnemonic devices for predicting the outcome of stereoselectivity were available. The Thiel study shows for the first time how the enzyme cyclohexanone monooxygenase as a standard Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase works in detail. In the enantioselective desymmetrization of 4-methylcyclohexanone with formation of the respective S-lactone (&gt;95% ee), the substrate is trapped in the binding pocket in a way that the Criegee intermediate is smoothly formed in the rate-determing step, followed by the usual σ-bond migration by one of the two enantiotopic groups. The computations show that, in the case of a chair conformation in which the 4-methyl group is in the equatorial position, only one of the two possible σ-bond migrations fulfills the traditional stereoelectronic requirement of anti-periplanar bond arrangement. <ref type="bibr">80a</ref> It is indeed the one that leads to the observed S-lactone. When the methyl group occupies the axial position, the other enantiotopic σ-bond migrates preferentially, leading to the enantiomeric product, which means that the difference in energy between the two chair conformers (∼2.3 kcal/mol) determines the degree of stereoselectivity! Recently the study has been extended to mutants catalyzing the desymmetrization of 4-hydroxycyclohexanone. <ref type="bibr">80b</ref> A second type of lesson that can be learned from directed evolution concerns insights arising from deconvolution experiments, especially if performed systematically to include the construction of fitness landscapes as reported in some ISM studies. 23a,49,50 Such data allow the following questions to be answered:</p><p xml:id="_mn24sBa">• How many evolutionary pathways lead to fitter enzymes in a given case?

Unfortunately, catalyst activity proved to be uniformly low.

The computational process involves ab initio protein structure prediction, QM energy refinement, and sequence design. Significant rates in the sense of practical applications have not resulted from these fascinating studies, but directed evolution provides a way to remedy the situation. In the case of the Diels-Alder reaction 27 + 28 → 29, the endo-(3S,4R)-configuration was aimed for in the design step. 86a Out of 84 computed and in E. coli expressed enzymes, two showed Diels-Alder activity. The best hit showed the predicted stereoselectivity in laboratory experiments, which is a remarkable result. The question why the results in the case of the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction 86b proved to be less successful needs to be addressed (no enantioselectivity reported in this asymmetric transformation).</p></div>

Continued basic research is needed. Synthetic organic chemistry is likewise experiencing enormous progress in developing economically and ecologically viable methods and novel strategies, which will continue for some time to come. Present-day metabolic engineering cannot replace synthetic organic chemistry, but it already contributes in a complementary manner. As indicated above, productive constellations can be anticipated in which the enormous power of the two fields will interact synergistically. In a constructive debate, Jay Keasling and Phil Baran have recently exchanged their personal views regarding synthetic biology versus synthetic organic chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">92</ref> Surely, both sciences will continue to thrive.</p><p xml:id="_d2FvWHK">12. CONCLUDING REMARKS For a long time the use of enzymes as catalysts in synthetic organic chemistry and biotechnology has suffered mainly from two types of limitations. The unfortunate fact that many in principle useful enzymes could not be expressed easily in large amounts limited the whole field, but this changed dramatically in the late 1970s with the development of recombinant DNA technology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">12</ref> The second major traditional limitation was the often observed poor stereo-and/or regioselectivity, narrow substrate scope, and sometimes insufficient stability under operating conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">13</ref> With the advent of directed evolution, these problems can now be addressed and generally solved, as demonstrated by numerous academic studies and a rapidly increasing number of industrial applications. <ref type="bibr">19,23,35,36c,d,69b</ref> This form of protein engineering can also be applied in the elimination of product inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">35</ref> or reduction of undesired side products. <ref type="bibr">34c</ref> It is likely that the already available advanced directed evolution techniques using the most efficient genetic methods and strategies will continue to be applied to all of the enzymatic reaction types. The introduction of unnatural amino acids in conjunction with directed evolution techniques is also an interesting perspective. <ref type="bibr">84</ref> Of particular synthetic importance are those enzyme-catalyzed transformations which are dif f icult or impossible using the best nonbiological catalysts. <ref type="bibr">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">70</ref> Systematic use of directed evolution of computationally designed enzymes for promiscuous transformations is likewise an area for present and future research, 83f specifically in the quest to generalize the concept and to boost activity so that such biocatalysts can begin to compete with well-established nonbiological catalysts.</p><p xml:id="_QnzMufk">Engineering of bioreactor systems, bioprocess design, enzyme immobilization, and improved downstream workup for ecologically and economically viable processes have made many industrial applications of biocatalysis possible, 13e-g and this is likely to continue in the future. Methodologies based on cell-free protein expression are also likely to gain in importance. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> All of these advancements now allow for biocatalytic retrosynthesis in synthetic organic chemistry, which in the distant past was problematic, especially when attempting to combine enzymes with synthetic catalysts and reagents in cascade processes. Today a new situation has emerged. Turner and O'Reilly have recently issued guidelines for retrosynthetic analyses incorporating enzymes and synthetic catalysts which promise to be useful for synthetic organic chemists. <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">93</ref> Metabolic engineering has clearly entered the stage in a different sense, catalysis occurring in cells in which pathways have been engineered leading to the production of complex natural products or simple compounds such as biofuels. <ref type="bibr">89</ref> This is not a trivial undertaking, and time will tell how far it can be generalized. Microbial genome mining for new natural products and biosynthetic pathways followed by metabolic pathway engineering can be expected to provide access to novel therapeutic drugs. The marriage of metabolic engineering and synthetic organic chemistry is also likely to be rewarding. Laboratory . Scheme outlining the semisynthetic route to artemisinin based on pathway engineering leading to arteminisinic acid followed by synthetic organic steps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">90</ref> evolution will continue to be an indispensible tool in pathway engineering, as it is when using mixtures of isolated WT enzymes or mutants in cascade reactions or when engineering a single enzyme for superior performance. A particular challenge for the future is the general and practical realization of any given artificial multistep pathway that a synthetic organic chemist might envision involving solely unnatural substrates in designer cells serving as de novo "chemical factories". <ref type="bibr">94</ref> This goal is different from metabolic engineering of secondary metabolites as it is practiced today.</p><p xml:id="_rMSGxek">Further improvements in the efficacy of directed evolution are desirable. For example, developing general selection methods replacing screening assays for application in laboratory evolution of stereo-and regioselective enzymes remains a challenge. The dynamics of enzymes also need to be considered more so than in the past, <ref type="bibr">95</ref> an area in which protein engineering can help. Directed evolution is also a useful tool in other research fields, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">19</ref> the study of the all-important phenomenon of protein-protein interactions being a prime example. <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">96</ref> Increased efforts in interpreting the results of mutations on a molecular level are likewise needed, especially when they prove to be cooperative (more than additive), <ref type="bibr">49,52a</ref> as revealed by systematic deconvolution studies. 23a,50 Since cooperativity as a form of nonadditivity of mutations appears to be more general than previously thought, enzymes seem to be part of nonlinear systems which are difficult to handle theoretically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">49</ref> Nevertheless, advanced theoretical techniques may someday lead to a general theory of enzymes which could enable the reliable prediction of mutations necessary for improving any given catalytic parameter of interest to the experimenter.</p><p xml:id="_U75duEN">Since methodology developments in biocatalysis and in modern synthetic organic chemistry are flourishing research fields serving society, both areas deserve fair and balanced f inancial support by governmental and private agencies. Finally, it can be hoped that the chemical curricula of undergraduate and graduate education will be modified in the future to treat at least the basics of biocatalysis as well as the handling of representative enzymes and whole cells in the laboratory.</p></div>
