<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_BHp9s87"><p xml:id="_htf5R6k">Biocatalysis has become an important aspect of modern organic synthesis, both in academia and across the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Its success has been largely due to a rapid expansion of the range of chemical reactions accessible, made possible by advanced tools for enzyme discovery coupled with high-throughput laboratory evolution techniques for biocatalyst optimization. A wide range of tailor-made enzymes with high efficiencies and selectivities can now be produced quickly and on a gram to kilogram scale, with dedicated databases and search tools aimed at making these biocatalysts accessible to a broader scientific community. This Primer discusses the current state-of-the-art methodology in the field, including route design, enzyme discovery, protein engineering and the implementation of biocatalysis in industry. We highlight recent advances, such as de novo design and directed evolution, and discuss parameters that make a good reproducible biocatalytic process for industry. The general concepts will be illustrated by recent examples of applications in academia and industry, including the development of multistep enzyme cascades.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_uKAKWz7"><p xml:id="_uXDrgzq">Enzymes have been employed for a wide variety of chemical processes for decades (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). For example, nitrile hydratases are used to make acrylamide on the thousands of tons scale, and enzymes have been added to detergents for more than 30 years 1,2 . More recently, the use of proteins as catalysts for chemical synthesis of more complex molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, has become increasingly widespread. Enzymes are particularly powerful because they merge the advantages of a directing group controlling selectivity and a catalyst in a single reagent <ref type="bibr">3</ref> , which can also be used with other enzymes in a one-pot reaction. Over the past 20 years, combined synthetic-enzymatic systems have enabled multiple total synthesis endeavours, and the use of enzymes is becoming routine in some process chemistry groups in industry 4 . Until recently, only a subset of enzymes, such as lipases or ketoreductases (KREDs), were available for chemical synthesis applications 5 . However, the growth of potential sources of enzymes for process chemistry applications has accelerated, resulting in a diverse toolkit of enzymes now available to researchers. In 2014, the development of a total enzymatic synthesis of the nucleoside didanosine highlighted the possibility of 'bio-retrosynthesis' <ref type="bibr">6</ref> . Based on the principles of retrosynthesis, where the target molecule is transformed into simple precursors by 'breaking' bonds that can be formed from synthetic transformations, 'bio-retrosynthesis' involves the design of an artificial enzyme cascade -a synthetic biochemical pathway -that offers a possible route towards the desired target molecule by choosing enzymes as catalysts for the required chemistry. The fully biocatalyst-driven synthesis of the HIV inhibitor islatravir (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which will be discussed in more detail in the Applications section, demonstrates the power of combining modern approaches towards designing new enzyme cascades, including repurposing of known biosynthetic pathways, screening of saturation mutagenesis libraries of enzyme variants and directed evolution against selected residues towards increased enzyme stability and turnover <ref type="bibr">7</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_Z5kqeA8">In this Primer, we discuss the different development stages (reaction design, biocatalyst choice and optimization, and bioprocess development) that can lead to a range of industrial products as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. These stages are interdependent and need to be closely integrated. Starting with a target molecule, a single or multistep biocatalytic process needs to be designed, often by manual design using expertise and precedent literature from organic synthesis and biocatalysis. More recently, programmes such as RetroBioCat 8 including biocatalyst databases are being developed to speed up this step and enable the automatic design of de novo biosynthetic pathways. Once a process has been designed, suitable enzymes need to be selected for each step and tested (Experimentation). The increasing adoption of biocatalysis by the pharmaceutical industry has been driven by innovative tools in protein engineering, which allow fast optimization of catalyst activity, including laboratory evolution and computational design (Experimentation). As a result, strict reaction parameters (Results) can now be met at reasonable timescales for successful bioprocess development (Applications). These parameters include non-physiological reaction conditions such as high activity on non-natural substrates, high temperature, high concentration of substrates and tolerance of organic solvents and wide pH ranges. Alongside protein engineering tools, databases of available biocatalysts with their reaction profiles are starting to be established (Reproducibility and data deposition). We also detail the current limitations of biocatalysis and areas of importance for further advancing this method to expand the breadth of applications (Limitations and optimizations). Finally, we highlight what the future holds for biocatalysis and the impact it will likely have in the next decade (Outlook).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_w4ChhS6">Experimentation</head><p xml:id="_Vq3kpUZ">In this section, we highlight several sources available to scientists looking for an enzyme as a starting point to develop a new biocatalyst. We discuss how one can optimize biocatalysts using directed evolution and computational design as well as how to incorporate non-canonical amino acids to enable novel chemistries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_kS9jQnk">Sources of biocatalysts</head><p xml:id="_FXWvPyF">Enzymes can be sourced from a few outlets that include commercial sources, adaptation of enzymes from biosynthesis, screening of metagenomic libraries and in silico mining of databases.</p><p xml:id="_XkTbUSK">Commercial sources of biocatalysts. Purified enzymes or lyophilized crude cell lysates are often available for direct purchase through chemical vendors (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). For example, one can purchase specific dehydrogenases, reductases or carbohydrate-active enzymes, and directly employ them in chemical synthesis. Libraries of commercially produced enzymes can be screened against specific substrates to identify candidate biocatalysts. Available libraries include oxidoreductases (KREDs, imine reductases (IREDs), ene reductases, Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases, monoamine oxidases), transferases (transaminases), lyases (nitrilases, halohydrin dehalogenases, acylases), carbon-carbon bond-forming enzymes and carbon-nitrogen bond-forming enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">9</ref> (Box 1).</p><p xml:id="_UC99ukw">In addition to these types of commercial sources and kits, the wide availability of commercial gene synthesis means that, in principle, any enzyme with a known amino acid sequence can be obtained through gene synthesis. Researchers can order the synthetic gene corresponding to the protein, recombinantly express it in a desirable host organism or by cell-free protein synthesis and, then, purify the protein for testing as one would similarly do with a catalyst in a chemical synthesis. Databases ranging from SciFinder (with a licence) to UniProt <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">10</ref> and BioCatNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">11</ref> allow researchers to identify enzymes that catalyse desired chemical transformations. Thus, through the combination of publicly available sequence data and commercial gene synthesis, any enzyme reported is available to the researcher, for a cost.</p><p xml:id="_2JyN24t">Natural product biosynthetic enzymes.

Therefore, natural product biosynthetic enzymes are a potential source for diverse catalysts. A recent review discusses the wide-ranging chemical and enzymatic diversity found in natural product biosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">12</ref> . From a biocatalytic point of view, the most important criteria in selecting a potential biosynthetic enzyme include its substrate specificity, cofactor dependence, turnover, stability, functional recombinant expression and ability to perform a stand-alone function outside its natural pathway within a cell.</p><p xml:id="_9Pb5AVe">One group of biosynthetic enzymes widely found in natural product biosynthesis are oxidative Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, which can catalyse challenging reactions such as hydroxylation, halogenation and oxidative cyclizations, typically for C(sp 3 )-H functionalization, due to the reactive intermediates generated in the catalytic cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">13</ref> . These powerful enzymes have emerged as useful biocatalysts for chemical synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">14</ref> . One example is GriE -an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the peptide griselimycin in Streptomyces 15 that hydroxylates the δ-carbon of l-leucine and was employed for a key step in the total synthesis of manzacidin C 16 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). Other examples include halogenases such as BesD, which chlorinate free amino acids to generate non-proteinogenic amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">17</ref> . A final example is KabC, which catalyses an oxidative cyclization and was employed in a biocatalytic synthesis of the neurochemical kainic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">18</ref> . These types of Fe(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes represent a promising group of biocatalysts for further development as they can be reconstituted either using Escherichia coli cell lysates or in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">19</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_HNqRQFq">Other known natural product biosynthetic enzymes with demonstrated use in chemical synthesis include methyltransferases <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">20</ref> , Diels-Alderases that catalyse cycloadditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">21</ref> , halogenases <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">22</ref> , uridine diphosphatedependent glycosyltransferases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">23</ref> , laccases <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">24</ref> and pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">25</ref> . However, biosynthetic enzymes are typically sluggish catalysts, with Michaelis constant k cat values typically about 30-fold lower than those of primary metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">26</ref> , which is probably owing to the constraints at work in their evolutionary histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">27</ref> . To this end, biosynthetic enzymes are viewed as starting points for directed evolution efforts to improve rates of catalysis, substrate tolerance as well as stability and solubility in desired solvents, which include ionic liquids and water-soluble organic solvents <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">23</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_KPY7S4x">Metagenomic and in silico screening.

Monoamine oxidases catalyse the oxidation of compounds containing one amino group and the resulting imine spontaneously forms a ketone in water (reaction iii).

For example, mammalian microbiomes are a rich source of carbohydrate-active enzymes, which are often encoded in polysaccharide utilization loci in specific bacterial genomes.

One approach involves the use of PCR amplification of genomic sequences with degenerate primers. These primers are a mixture of oligonucleotide sequences that code for highly conserved regions of a desired type of catalyst, and therefore allow amplification of genes encoding for this catalyst from naturally derived DNA libraries. For example, sponge microbiomes are known for their biosynthetic capabilities, and in a case of sequence-based screening with degenerate primers, a new halogenase Krml was isolated from a sponge microbiome and employed for the regioselective halogenation of tryptophan and a range of indole-derived peptide substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">36</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_PEVAhjD">Another approach is the direct analysis of sequencing data, where specific types of desired enzymes can be found through in silico analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">37</ref> .

One enzyme from this set of candidates retained activity in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a solvent tolerance that had not been reported in a transaminase previously.

The chosen method of library generation depends on factors such as the availability of structural information and screening capacity. The design of smaller, more focused libraries (10 2 -10 4 variants) often employs computational modelling and bioinformatics to guide the selection of amino acid residues for randomization.

First step in the evolution cycle involves creating a library of DNA variants using standard molecular biology techniques (step 1).

Proteins are evaluated using high-throughput screening techniques such as plate-based assays coupled with high performance liquid chromatography analysis, colony-based assays coupled with colorimetric detection or microfluidicsbased assays coupled with fluorescence detection, where X represents the starting material and Y represents the fluorescent product or by-product (step 3).

It is common to use multiple mutagenesis techniques during enzyme evolution to target different regions of the protein structure. For example, focused active site mutations can be beneficial for reshaping substrate binding pockets and improving activity towards non-native substrates, and mutations to the protein surface and flexible loop regions can often result in improved solvent tolerance and thermostability. Beneficial mutations are typically combined during evolutionary optimization using DNA shuffling and can be guided by computational algorithms.</p><p xml:id="_9KTv9Jp">Transforming cells with DNA libraries leads to spatial separation of library members and establishes a link between genotype and phenotype that must be maintained during protein production and screening to allow characterization of individual library members. Arraying colonies into multiwell plates for protein production and screening offers the greatest versatility, as variants can be evaluated using a wide range of chromato graphic, spectrophotometric and spectroscopic techniques. Although chromatographic methods are of relatively low throughput, they are commonly employed for applications in industrial biocatalysis as the assays are compatible with screening under process conditions, which often employ high substrate loadings (&gt;100 g l -1 ), co-solvents (for example, up to 50% DMSO in aqueous media) and high temperatures (40-50 °C). This workflow can also be automated to improve speed, accuracy and throughput. For example, colony pickers allow users to array 10 3 colonies per hour into 96-well plates, liquid handling robots accelerate aliquoting and transfer steps required for library generation and protein production, and reaction analysis using state-of-the-art ultra-high performance liquid chromatography systems allows evaluation of 10 3 clones per instrument per day. GSK used this approach to engineer an enantioselective IRED with a 38,000-fold improvement over the wild-type enzyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">47</ref> . This IRED variant was employed in a reductive amination and kinetic resolution step to manufacture the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor GSK2879552, a treatment for small cell lung cancer and acute leukaemia. Following a similar approach, Codexis and Merck have engineered five different enzymes, which form part of an impressive nine-enzyme cascade process to manufacture the HIV treatment islatravir 7 (see Applications section for a more detailed discussion and reaction scheme).</p><p xml:id="_dVJFcGm">In order to evaluate larger libraries of 10 5 -10 8 variants, more specialized screening approaches can be employed, including colony-based assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[50]</ref> , fluorescence-activated cell sorting 51 , phage display <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">52</ref> , microfluidic-based screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">54</ref> , selection-based approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">55</ref> and continuous evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">57</ref> . For example, monoamine oxidase from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N) has been extensively engineered for the selective oxidation of a wide range of amine substrates using a colorimetric colony-based assay that relies on the detection of the hydrogen peroxide co-product by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a reactive dye <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">58</ref> . The throughput of oxidase evolution based on hydrogen peroxide detection can be further increased by screening variants in picolitre droplets. Indeed, in a recent study, an ultra-high-throughput microfluidic assay was used to screen a library of 10 7 cyclohexylamine oxidase variants and, after only a single round of evolution, the most improved variant isolated had a 960-fold improvement in catalytic efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">59</ref> . Although the screening capacity in this example is greatly increased, picolitre droplet sorting is currently restricted to fluorescence as a detection method, which limits the versatility of this approach. Ongoing research is focused on coupling microfluidics with alternative methods of detection, such as mass spectrometry, to provide approaches for a wide host of chemistries <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">60</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_FmXCCv8">Selection-based approaches including continuous evolution platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[55]</ref> , where improved catalyst performance is linked to cell viability, offer ultra-high-throughput screening capabilities (10 6 -10 10 variants). These methods are highly specialized as improvements in the enzyme activity of interest must be linked to cell survival. Optimization of these multicomponent systems requires considerable effort and can take up to several years; it is important to have control over the stringency of the selection pressure and to ensure that the host organism is not able to evolve alternative mechanisms of survival. However, for enzymes whose native activities can be associated with organism fitness, this type of assay is particularly powerful as it allows rapid evaluation of broad sequence space. A key example is the development of a selection-based method for engineering pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetases (PylRS) for the genetic incorporation of non-canonical amino acids into proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">55</ref> . This versatile approach has been applied by numerous research groups to the evolution of a panel of PylRS variants, which are now able to accept more than 150 different non-canonical amino acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">61</ref> .</p></div>

The transition states of the desired transformation in the theoretical enzyme or 'theozyme' active site pocket is modelled with quantum mechanics to assess the potential rate acceleration and the ideal geometric constraints for optimal transition state stabilization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4Aa</ref>).

Further refinements to this original formulation (named inside-out) can be made by incorporating data on protein conformational dynamics by means of short molecular dynamics simulations. In these simulations, the enzyme variant is immersed in a water solvent box, and whether the optimal arrangement of the catalytic residues -also known as the near attack conformation -is maintained throughout the simulation time is assessed. A higher number of near attack conformations explored during the molecular dynamics is attributed to a higher catalytic activity and/or selectivity as the catalytic residues are properly arranged for catalysis most of the simulation time. These observations resulted in the development of some computational methodologies based on Rosetta and molecular dynamics simulations for enhancing the enzyme activity and selectivity (catalytic selectivity by computational design (CASCO), as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4Ab</ref>) or thermostability (framework for rapid enzyme stabilization by computational libraries (FRESCO)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">67</ref> .

Protein conformational dynamics can be incorporated using short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to refine this estimation, ultimately enhancing enzyme activity and selectivity (catalytic selectivity by computational design (CASCO)) (part Ab). Additional refinements for multistate design allow for considering a set of related structures often coming from short-timescale MD simulations in the design process (part Ac). B | Methods that consider the conformational changes key for substrate binding or product release: MD simulations and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. CAVER software is used to model the different tunnels that are available for substrate binding to the active site and product release (part Ba). Tunnel analysis allows identification of the narrowest regions, that is the bottleneck, where mutations are usually introduced (part Ba). Recent approaches take advantage of the information gained from extensive MD simulations for identifying key conformationally relevant residues (not strictly located at the active site), which by mutation can induce a shift in the relative populations of the conformational states stabilizing the catalytically relevant ones (shortest path map, SPM) (part Bb). Selection of an ancestral enzyme scaffold displaying high levels of flexibility can be also used for the design of new enzymatic activities (part Bc). Images of proteins throughout the figure were generated using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrödinger, LLC.) from either normal mode analysis, short molecular dynamics simulations or small perturbations in the enzyme backbone angles for multi-state design (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4Ac</ref>) were proposed to include some limited protein flexibility in the design process <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">68</ref> . Although these strategies include some protein flexibility during the design, the ensemble of conformations used is rather similar as they come from usually short (picosecond to nanosecond) molecular dynamics simulations. Other strategies are based on computing the direct effect of the included mutations on the activation barrier of the enzyme-catalysed process (with the computationally more demanding quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics or empirical valence bond (EVB) strategies, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>), rather than estimating the effect by means of some key geometrical constraints (as in the near attack conformation analysis) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">69</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_6msqwc6">The importance of enzyme conformational dynamics for enzyme design gained popularity in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[72]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>).

These mutations can be located at the active site or may be located at distal positions and induce a long-range effect that impacts the enzyme active site pocket and, thus, catalysis. This impact on enzymatic activity is often achieved by favouring the enzyme conformational states that are key for the novel functionality (catalytically productive conformations), while disfavouring non-productive conformational states, thus converting computational enzyme design into a population shift problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">64</ref> . In this direction, some conformationally driven computational approaches focused on identifying such long-range allosteric networks of interactions include the shortest path map (SPM) tool and have been used recently for predicting distal and active site mutations <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">76</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4Bb</ref>). Multistate computational design based on ensembles of enzyme conformations taken from room-temperature X-ray crystallography corresponds to a successful strategy for efficient computational enzyme design <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">77</ref> . The reconstruction of ancestral enzymes that display a higher degree of flexibility than their modern counterparts and their use as initial scaffolds for enzyme design has additionally yielded interesting new insights <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">78</ref> . The higher flexibility observed in many ancestral variants was key for achieving high catalytic activity with only a few mutations located at the active site.

It should be pointed out that biocatalytic cascades have only become more commonly used because of the advances in biocatalyst design and build discussed elsewhere in this Primer.</p><p xml:id="_McCtfwT">Biocatalytic cascades <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">97,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">98</ref> typically feature two or more steps (functional group interconversions or bond forming) with at least one enzymatic transformation and without intermediate isolations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref>). The definition of 'cascade' is generally broadly applied within the biocatalysis community to describe not only concurrent, multienzyme processes in one pot but also reactions in which components are added sequentially or process steps are telescoped despite attempts to impart order on the nomenclature <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[99]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[100]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[101]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[102]</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_jJwuuEd">The development of novel biocatalytic cascades can be broadly described by a design-build-optimize cycle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6b</ref>) until a final process is achieved 3,103 .

Any cofactor requirements or potential compound incompatibilities should be considered at this stage.</p><p xml:id="_x8NYyHN">Once a process design is in place, enzymes need to be identified to fulfil each cascade step. Enzymes can be identified from the literature, from screening of enzyme libraries or from enzyme discovery efforts. When it comes to building the cascade, there is a choice of operating the enzymatic steps with purified or crude cell-free extracts (in vitro), with viable whole cells (in vivo) or with a combination of the two (hybrid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">103</ref> .

Other illustrative examples can be found in excellent recent articles 4, <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[113]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">[114]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[115]</ref> . New biocatalytic processes aim to generate new molecules of considerable commercial interest. They may also be designed to replace or complement existing non-optimal chemical or biocatalytic syntheses in industry. In either case, the viability and possible bottlenecks of a biocatalytic process can be assessed using both economic and green chemistry process performance metrics 116-119 (TABlE <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_NYjQVgd">Both high substrate concentration and conversion are desired in industrial reactions to achieve high product concentrations and so reduce the product recovery cost. Reactions resulting in low product concentrations may require additional concentration steps or large volumes of extraction solvent, which will increase costs associated with a rise in energy consumption and/or waste production. Thus, an ideal biocatalyst's activity should not be inhibited by high substrate concentrations (&gt;50 g l -1 ) or the amount of co-solvent required for substrate solubilization. It is worth mentioning that substrate loadings as high as &gt;1 kg l -1 for aldoxime dehydratase, which catalyses the synthesis of linear aliphatic nitriles, have been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">120</ref> . Nevertheless, frequently observed detrimental effects at high substrate concentration or by organic solvents on biocatalysts can be alleviated using fed-batch strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">121</ref> . In examples where inhibition of the enzyme by-product, unfavourable thermodynamic reaction equilibria or product side reactions are problematic, in situ product removal can be applied <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">122</ref> . To remove a product resulting from an ongoing enzyme-catalysed reaction, various techniques can be used such as in situ product crystallization, adsorption, distillation and extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">122,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">123</ref> .

Numerous robust enzymes of industrial interest have been discovered or redesigned over the past decade by enzyme engineering, computational methods, genome mining, ancestral sequence reconstruction or combinations thereof. A recent example using FRESCO generated an alcohol dehydrogenase mutant with a melting temperature -the temperature at which half of the protein is unfolded at equilibrium -of 94 °C (close to water's boiling point) and this has previously been applied successfully to other enzyme classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">124</ref> . Sequence reconstruction of a robust ancestor has been achieved for an increasing number of biocatalysts including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">125</ref> , carboxylic acid reductases <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">126</ref> , flavin-containing monooxygenases <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">127</ref> and laccases <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">128</ref> , made available in a recently created database of resurrected proteins with 211 members (Revenant) <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">129</ref> .

When selecting a biocatalyst for process development, it is often desirable to select enzymes that will enable freedom to operate to avoid infringing intellectual property rights or to access desired patented biocatalysts during the early stages of process design.

A few of the most desired characteristics of efficient industrial biocatalysts have been highlighted above, which include high activity, stability, ease of immobilization, environmental sustainability and accessibility. The importance of other relevant properties of a good biocatalyst, such as substrate selectivity, evolvability and affordability, will be illustrated through various examples in the following sections.</p></div>

These characteristics are not often observed for industrial chemical catalysts. Also, biocatalysts usually act under mild reaction conditions and can be engineered towards the desired substrate scope. Thus, biocatalysis paves the way for a bio-based economy, less reliant on fossil fuels <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">117</ref> .

Chemically heterogeneous catalysts are challenging rivals for biocatalysts in terms of productivity, often reaching production rates of 1-10 and 0.001-0.3 kg l -1 h -1 , respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">140</ref> . High productivities of 50-100 g l -1 h -1 have been achieved using free-resting Rhodococcus cells containing nitrile hydratase for the synthesis of acrylamide from acrylonitrile, considered to be one of the most successful industrial biocatalytic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">140,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">141</ref> . Acrylamide is used to produce polyacrylamide, which is used in water treatment, oil exploitation and the textile industry sector, as well as many others. The potential of nitrile hydratase as an industrial biocatalyst for the hydration of nitriles to form higher-value amides was demonstrated in the 1980s 1 . The vast market for acrylamide and the lack of an efficient chemical process for its production have propelled the improvement of the biocatalytic process over the past few years. The selection and optimization of a robust microbial host for nitrile hydratase was instrumental in preventing enzyme inactivation, owing to the high acrylamide concentrations required in the industrial process (300-500 g l -1 ) and the underlying exothermic nature of the reaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">141</ref> . A selective robust transaminase was obtained, by combining rational mutagenesis, directed evolution and a substrate walking approach, for the large-scale manufacture of the antidiabetic drug sitagliptin under demanding industrial conditions (200 g l -1 substrate loading, 50% DMSO and 45 °C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">142</ref> .

IREDs are of great interest for the industrial synthesis of cyclic and acyclic amines via the reduction of C=N bonds. This study identified reaction bottlenecks (for example, enzyme stability) and exposed possible strategies to overcome them (for example, using a fed-batch process) for a model reaction. Importantly, the first industrial synthesis catalysed by an IRED (on a 20-l scale) was recently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">47</ref> , highlighting an excellent industrial biocatalyst after three rounds of directed evolution, which outcompeted the corresponding chemical process with respect to green metrics such as lower catalyst requirement. This engineered IRED is used for the industrial synthesis of the LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552. In contrast to the IRED used as starting point in this study, the engineered IRED is an excellent biocatalyst due to its increased stability under the required reaction conditions (moderately acidic pH and 20 g l -1 substrate concentration) showing a 38,000-fold improvement in turnover. In this case, the selectivity -another requirement for a good biocatalyst -needed no further improvement. The preparation of the fragrance ingredient (-)-ambrox using an engineered squalene hopene cyclase is another example of a successful industrial biocatalytic process, which achieved relatively high productivity (12 g l -1 h -1 ) for catalysing the cyclization of (E,E)-homofarnesol to yield (-)-ambrox <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">143</ref> . The enzyme variant used in this study, which exhibited a 10-fold increase in productivity over the wild type, was discovered by random mutagenesis. This cyclase whole-cell biotransformation in E. coli was carried out under conditions that were optimized using a design of experiments strategy, in which the optimized parameters included the cell, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and (E,E)-homofarnesol concentrations, temperature and pH. SDS was required in this process to ensure substrate solubilization and access to the enzyme through the cell membrane.</p></div>

Studies that have uncovered the extraordinary diversity of enzymes involved in natural product biosynthetic pathways have provided promising industrial biocatalysts with complementary selectivity as well as substrate scope. For example, the recent comparison of three similar FAD-dependent monooxygenases, which catalyse the oxidative dearomatization of phenol and resorcinol in different biosynthetic pathways, has revealed their complementary site selectivities and stereoselectivities by testing a diverse panel of unnatural substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">144</ref> . This approach enabled the identification of an optimal biocatalyst for specific asymmetric transformations of phenols into ortho-quinols, a chemical reaction of great value in the synthesis of various bioactive natural products <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">144</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tcaRqaU">Reproducibility issues in the field</head><p xml:id="_kVD9FJW">A successful biocatalyst database requires a system that captures all useful information on biocatalyst performance reported in the literature. However, the diverse scientific communities that work with and characterize biocatalysts have varying standards when it comes to recording reaction parameters and outcomes, with some favouring kinetic data and others preferring to record percentage conversions and overall yields, for example. These different approaches have resulted in a wealth of information for many different enzyme classes and homologues that may not be directly comparable with one another, and so it becomes necessary to standardize the data collected in order to obtain a better overall picture of where select developments stand. One such way of standardizing data reported in the literature would be to categorize reactions qualitatively for enzyme activities with respect to a given substrate (for example, high, medium, low, none). Different data sources, such as percentage conversions and specific activities, could be categorized in this way and then compared against each other. Alternatively, biocatalytic experiments could be standardized in the laboratory prior to data deposition. For numerous years, the STRENDA (Standards for Reporting Enzyme Data) commission has sought to provide guidelines on the experimental detail required when reporting enzyme activities and kinetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b154">163</ref> . Recently, these guidelines have been incorporated into an online storage and validation tool, where enzyme data can be deposited and checked for compliance with the STRENDA guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">164</ref> . This serves as a useful blueprint for reporting biotransformations in biocatalysis, but likely must be extended to include the additional datatypes often reported in biocatalysis papers, for example percentage conversion.</p><p xml:id="_bQFFqKb">Recently, numerous start-up companies have emerged across biology and chemistry to develop smart-laboratory infrastructures, aiming to make research more reproducible by capturing data on all of the possible variables in an experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">165</ref> . Others offer platforms to structure the collected data in a process, allowing machine learning to pull insight out of the vast data sets that smart-laboratories might produce <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">166</ref> . Experimentally, this can allow trends to be observed that might otherwise be missed -for example, a new batch of a reagent causing a drop in yields, or a shift in pH causing improved enantioselectivity. The digitization of experimental procedures and data collection should greatly improve the reproducibility of experiments across biology and chemistry. In particular, this may allow methods sections in journals to offer links to a more atomized record of the experimental procedures carried out. However, uptake by academia may be slow in comparison with industry laboratories, where electronic laboratory notebooks are more commonly employed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_sqPDEPV">Cost and accessibility</head><p xml:id="_wvnNFHU">Biocatalyst cost usually has an influence on the viability of an industrial process, but especially in the synthesis of low-priced products. Currently, a wide variety of affordable enzyme collections (kits) are accessible from various vendors (for example, Prozomix, Almac, Codexis and Gecco). Enzyme discovery and production in-house is the alternative approach. Advantages and limitations of these options, 'the buy or build operating models' , have been previously discussed <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">167</ref> . The choice of biocatalyst format (for example, purified, whole-cell or crude preparations) varies, depending on the particular application and enzyme class. Obviously, well-expressed enzymes are highly desired to reduce costs and effort. Access to an increasingly diverse platform of molecular biology tools allows the tailoring of enzyme performance to meet demanding industrial requirements and to efficiently convert non-natural substrates. Generation of improved biocatalysts by enzyme engineering is possible simply because enzymes are able to tolerate in vitro mutation. Thus, evolvability is another highly desirable property of a good biocatalyst. Engineering one enzyme may take only a few months, but building complex cellular metabolic networks may take years and demand considerable economic investment <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">168</ref> . These timescales are not fast enough to meet 'the need for speed' in industry <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">169</ref> . A recent example of a three-step route including two enzymatic steps, which was developed in just 6 months, is the synthesis of the COVID-19 direct-acting antiviral molnupiravir <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">154</ref> . Development of highly efficient biocatalysts by either rational or evolution techniques will be accelerated in the near future by expanding both the use of machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">170</ref> and ultra-high-throughput screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">171</ref> technologies for protein engineering.</p><p xml:id="_YB8ANb7">Machine-learning algorithms use the sequencefunction data resulting from experimental work to predict which new enzyme mutants may exhibit the desired property. Thus, DNA sequences of both improved and unimproved variants are valuable in generating initial data sets. Importantly, machine-learning methods allow a reduction in the number of mutants that have to be produced and tested in the laboratory to discover a significant fraction of improved enzymes, and are particularly interesting in cases that require expensive or labour-intensive screening methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">170</ref> . The additional costs of implementing machine-learning algorithms in a traditional protein engineering laboratory include computation and DNA sequencing, costs that are decreasing and, thus, are affordable for numerous research groups in both academia and industry. To explore a vast protein sequence space (library sizes &gt;10 6 variants), ultra-high-throughput screening technologies have been developed. Many academic or industrial researchers have access to flow cytometers to perform fluorescence-based screenings of up to 10 8 enzyme variants per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">172</ref> . Complementary or improved technologies are rapidly emerging in this field. Miniaturization of the reaction volume is generally pursued because it increases the speed of screening and reduces associated costs and waste. Label-free detection methods are also highly desired, allowing for screening without a reporter molecule. A recent example meeting both objectives allowed the analysis of around 15,000 samples in 6 h using droplet microfluidics (nanolitre scale) coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">60</ref> . Development and wide access to novel technologies for biocatalysis has been propelled by recent investments from, for example, the European Commission and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) to facilitate collaborations between industry and academia. The recent establishment of a Global Biofoundry Alliance represents another example <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">173</ref> . Biofoundries are facilities to automate the design-build-test iteration cycle for engineering biology, which allows the fast delivery of genetically reprogrammed organisms for biotechnology <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">77</ref> . Access to biocatalysts is also facilitated by other strategies such as Science Exchange (an online marketplace of research services) and collaborations established between the Centre of Excellence for Biocatalysis, Biotransformations and Biocatalytic Manufacture (CoEBio3) and various companies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fU8R6ZM">Expanding the range of biocatalysis</head><p xml:id="_Hg9pkBH">Biocatalytic transformations, particularly those routinely applied in industry, often effect functional group interconversions with high conversion and selectivity. However, one of the biggest gaps is broader enzyme platforms that perform C-C bond formation. Despite a plethora of enzymes used in nature for C-C bond formation in primary and secondary metabolism, they are often challenging to repurpose for non-natural substrates. Only a handful of enzymatic C-C bond-forming enzymes have been utilized for industrial applications, mainly limited to aldol reactions, acyloin condensations or cyanohydrin formation catalysed by lyases <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">174,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b166">175</ref> . A recent review highlights progress made in this space to diversify the toolbox of enzymes and the C-C bond-forming reactions they catalyse <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">176</ref> . Another industrial gap is scalable and robust oxidative enzymes. Despite the potential to catalyse remote and unactivated C-H oxidations, which are chemically challenging, enzymes such as cytochrome P450s and other oxygenases are problematic to scale up due to low activity, instability and promiscuity, resulting in a mixture of products <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">177</ref> . However, these features are well-suited for small-scale, late-stage diversification of biologically active compounds in which the enzyme promiscuity is advantageous to generate new libraries of compounds for evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">178,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">179</ref> . The synthetic utility of the transformation afforded by these enzymes encourages continued efforts to find solutions and realize the potential of these biocatalysts for large-scale manufacture <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">180</ref> .</p></div>

However, the range of reactions compared with those used in organic synthesis is still small and there are some obvious gaps in the repertoire of biocatalytic reactions that are currently being identified, including halogenation, amidebond formation, C-C bond formation and cleavage, ether formation, carbonylation, C=C bond functionalization, isomerization and reduction of isolated C=C bonds <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">140</ref> . Some of these issues are being addressed by combining chemical and enzymatic reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">185</ref> . Biocatalysis also offers opportunities to develop reactions that are chemically difficult, such as remote and selective C-H activation, which is often observed in nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">148,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">178</ref> , but the scale and substrate scope remain limitations for biocatalytic C-H activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">186</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_NqYuBw9">The use of enzyme cascades is a particularly attractive aspect of biocatalysis, because of general reaction compatibility and the ability to telescope several reactions either in cell-free systems or whole cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">103</ref> , akin to biosynthetic pathways. The design of such cascades is already starting to become automated using dedicated computational tools and databases that provide rich resources to the scientific community 8 . The accessibility of obtaining biocatalysts through commercial sources or from synthetic genes is continuing to lower the barrier to entry for biosynthesis and the bottleneck for reaction screening is now often at the assay stage, where more label-free high-throughput analytical methods are needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">50</ref> . Current successes for compounds such as islatravir 7 and molnupiravir <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">154</ref> have demonstrated the application of biocatalysis to multistep syntheses of small molecules. The next challenges will be to extend the application scope to targets of increasing molecular complexity and size, as well as to decrease the time required to develop efficient biocatalytic industrial processes. Examples of production of bulk chemicals and polymers by biocatalysis are still rare and offer a rich opportunity in terms of green chemistries. Biocatalysis also has a role to play in generating new modalities more efficiently and selectively for the biopharmaceutical industries, such as producing biomacromolecules and antibody-drug conjugates.</p><p xml:id="_g6gV8GG">Looking to the future, there are numerous key trends and scientific breakthroughs that are promising to have a significant impact on accelerating the discovery, development and application of biocatalysts. First of all, the range of chemical, new to nature biocatalytic reactions is rapidly expanding using de novo design <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">187</ref> and/or directed evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b179">188</ref> . Increasingly powerful computational tools will allow for better de novo design but will also provide better selection tools for identifying suitable biocatalysts from the rich protein primary sequence information already accessible in databanks. Advances in computational methods to predict the protein structure from sequences through artificial intelligence 189 and subsequent prediction of function and physicochemical properties will provide access to biocatalysts that are finely tuned to the requirements of a desired target reaction and/or product <ref type="bibr">[190]</ref><ref type="bibr">[191]</ref><ref type="bibr">[192]</ref> . To maximize synthetic utility, these tools will need to be integrated with the design of new biocatalytic cascade processes. Many individual steps of biocatalyst development can already be automated at the implementation stage, including desktop DNA printing, cell-free protein expression, enzyme immobilization and analysis, which hints at the potential for 'fully automated biocatalytic synthesizers' being available to individual laboratories 3 within the next decade.</p><p xml:id="_D4YMKe3">In conclusion, biocatalysis has enabled essential contributions to the safe, cheap and sustainable production of high-value chemicals and pharmaceuticals, but still provides many exciting challenges for potential advancements. </p></div>
