Interest in these compounds, often heralded as the green, high-tech media of the future, 2 is still increasing rapidly <ref type="bibr">3</ref> and stems from their near-zero vapor pressure, <ref type="bibr">4</ref> their thermal stability, <ref type="bibr">5</ref> and their widely tunable properties as regards polarity, hydrophobicity, and solvent miscibility behavior through appropriate modification of the cation and the anion. Mainly on account of their unconventional miscibility behavior, ionic liquids show an increasing potential to revolutionize reaction technology. Their synthesis, physicochemical properties, and major fields of application have been reviewed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">6</ref> and the number of applications of ionic liquids as reaction media for organic synthesis and catalysis is growing rapidly. Many types of ionic liquids are now commercially available in high purity. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> Biocatalysis in ionic liquids media was first reported in 2000. <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[10]</ref> The early work involved ionic liquids composed of a 1,3-dialkylimidazolium or N-alkylpyridinium cation and a weakly coordinating anion (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Tables <ref type="table">1</ref><ref type="table">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>). These still play a major role, but the attention is slowly shifting toward new structural types. A number of brief overviews of the literature on biocatalysis in ionic liquids have appeared, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[13]</ref> to keep readers abreast of the rapidly expanding subject. These tend to focus on the recent highlights, usually complemented with a tabular overview. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">13</ref> Yang and Pan have published a more extensive review that covers many aspects of the subject (solvent properties, including purity issues, enzyme activity, stability and selectivity). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">14</ref> A review by Moon et al. is focused on biocatalytic transformations in ionic liquids. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">15</ref> The background to the interest in biocatalysis in ionic liquids is a desire to replace volatile organic solvents by nonvolatile ionic liquids. Organic solvents are widely used with enzymes, although these function admirably in water, their natural medium, to improve the solubility of hydrophobic reactants and/or products and to shift reaction equilibria from hydrolysis toward synthesis. Moreover, the unconventional solvent properties of ionic liquids have already given rise to new and highly efficient reaction methodologies.</p><p xml:id="_kMprKy2">Here we will review the various issues that surround biocatalysis in ionic liquids. The effects of ionic liquids on the structure and activity of enzymes as well as on their thermal and operational stability will be surveyed. Furthermore, the effects of ionic liquids on the (enantio)selectivity of biocatalytic transformations in comparison with conventional reaction media and the design of efficient reaction procedures based on the unconventional solvent characteristics of ionic liquids will be reviewed.

Thus, it has recently been shown that small amounts of chloride ion cause a severe deactivation of two lipases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">18</ref> Some early results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids proved to be difficult to reproduce, probably due to the presence of such impurities. The purity issue, as well as the detection and removal of impurities, has been reviewed recently. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">16</ref> Water is a common contaminant, as even water immiscible ionic liquids are hygroscopic and readily absorb a few percent of water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">17</ref> Such adventitious water in ionic liquids that contain [BF 4 ] or [PF 6 ] ions may cause partial hydrolysis of these latter anions with formation of HF, which inhibits many types of enzymes.</p><p xml:id="_qbPN8XG">Significant results with biocatalysis in ionic liquids require careful attention to the purity issue. The contaminants in commercial ionic liquids are usually specified by the supplier. Ionic liquids for use in anhydrous systems should be kept free of water by storage over phosphorus pentoxide. Ionic liquids that contain hydrolyzable groups, such as [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions, require testing for acid prior to use. Ionic liquids prepared in-house via the chloride route should be assayed for halide, e.g., by a silver chromate test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2." xml:id="_P5h9XYU">Polarity</head><p xml:id="_qzvMy2R">Ionic liquids are usually considered to be highly polar, on account of their ionic nature, but reality is much more checkered. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Solvent polarity, which should not be confused with hydrophilicity, is a complex concept, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19</ref> and it is highly unlikely that a single, universal scale will ever be defined. The subject of ionic liquid polarity has been addressed by a variety of methodologies, which will be reviewed briefly. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">20</ref> The propensity of solvents to stabilize a charge is usually determined from the absorption maximum of a solvatochromic dye, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">21</ref> such as Nile Red <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">22</ref> or Reichardt's dye, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19</ref> or by using a fluorescent probe. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">23</ref> The method actually probes the H-bond donating propensitysR in Kamlet-Taft terminology <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">24</ref> swhich, in ionic liquids, is a property of the cation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">25</ref> By this measure, the polarity of common ionic liquid types, such as the archetypical [BMIm][BF 4 ] (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table">4</ref>), is in the range of the lower alcohols <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[27]</ref> or formamide. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">28</ref> A solvatochromic test for the coordination strength (nucleophilicity) of the anion, in contrast, indicates that the often used [PF 6 ] and [NTf 2 ] anions are much less nucleophilic (and, by implication, less "polar") than the lower alcohols. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">25</ref> Other aspects of polarity are dipolarity/polarizability and the H-bond accepting ability of the anion (π* and β in Kamlet-Taft terms), which have recently been measured using suitable solvatochromic dyes (see later). <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">29</ref> A completely different approach to solvent polarity is the measurement of keto-enol equilibria, as these are known to depend on the polarity of the medium. This latter methodology, when applied to probe the polarity of ionic liquids, indicated that [BMIm][BF 4 ], [BMIm][PF 6 ], and [BMIm][NTf 2 ] are more polar than methanol or acetonitrile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">30</ref> The dielectric constants of a number of ionic liquids have been calculated on the basis of microwave dielectric spectroscopy measurements. By this yardstick, the polarity of [BMIm][BF 4 ] and [BMIm] [PF 6 ] is in the range of a mediumchain alcohol, such as 1-hexanol or 1-octanol, with marked contributions from the anion as well the cation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">32</ref> Attempts to predict ionic liquid dielectric constants from solvatochromic shifts were often wide off the mark.</p><p xml:id="_ScF2c8H">Simple chemical reasoning would predict that a polar medium would dissolve polar compounds, such as, for example, carbohydrates, quite well. By this measure, the ionic liquids [BMIm][BF 4 ], which is hydrophilic, and [BMIm]-[PF 6 ], which is hydrophobic, miserably fail the polarity test, because these dissolve less than 0.5 g/L of glucose at room temperature. <ref type="bibr">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">34</ref> The concept of solvent polarity has proven useful with molecular solvents, because the outcomes based on chemical intuition and physical organic chemistry match quite well. With ionic liquids, in contrast, it would seem that the polarity concept is too elusive to serve as a basis to predict, for example, solubility behavior or reaction rate. There are, moreover, indications that solvent-solute interactions of ionic liquids obey a dual interaction model (i.e., ionic liquids behave like a nonpolar solvent with nonpolar solutes but display a polar character with polar solutes), even to the extent that ionic liquids should be regarded as nanostructured materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[37]</ref> </p></div>

It was soon discovered, however, that even water-miscible ionic liquids, such as [BMIm][BF 4 ], do not dissolve simple sugars to an appreciable degree. [BMIm][Cl], in contrast, dissolves massive amounts of cellulose, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">39</ref> and it was demonstrated that the ability of ionic liquids to dissolve complex compounds, such as sugars and proteins, mainly depends on the H-bond accepting properties of the anion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">40</ref> The miscibility of ionic liquids and water varies widely and unpredictably.</p><p xml:id="_kaEsDNE">[BMIm][BF 4 ] and [BMIm][MeSO 4 ] are water-miscible, but [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [BMIm][Tf 2 N] are not. These ionic liquids are of similar polarity on the Reichardt scale, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">19</ref> and the coordination strengths of the [BF 4 ] and [PF 6 ] anions are also comparable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">25</ref> Neither is the partitioning of ionic liquids between water and 1-octanol a predictor of water miscibility, as the log P values of water immiscible [BMIm]-[PF 6 ] and water miscible [BMIm][AcO] and [BMIm][NO 3 ] are -2.4, -2.8, and -2.9, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">41</ref> A recent measurement of the H-bond accepting properties of such ionic liquids revealed, however, that [BF 4 ] and [MeSO 4 ] are better H-bond acceptors (β ) 0.61 and 0.75, respectively) than [PF 6 ] (β ) 0.50), <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">29</ref> which could go a long way in explaining the difference in water miscibility. It should be noted that aqueous mixtures of ionic liquids may not be homogeneous at molecular scale because, even in methanol, water does not mix at a molecular level but is mainly present as strings or clusters of molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">42</ref> Water-immiscible ionic liquids are nevertheless hygroscopic, as noted above, and readily absorb a few percent of water, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">17</ref> approximately corresponding with a hemihydrate. IR spectroscopic analysis has confirmed that water interacts mainly with the anion <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">43</ref> via the formation of double Hbonds, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">44</ref> at least when the cation is a weak hydrogen bond donor, as was the case here.</p><p xml:id="_TkNwFtd">The miscibility behavior of ionic liquids and organic solvents is not well documented. A relationship with the dielectric constant has been proposed, as lower alcohols and ketones, dichloromethane, and THF ( ) 7.58) mix with, for example, [BMIm][Tf 2 N], whereas alkanes and ethers do not; ethyl acetate seems to be a borderline case. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">45</ref> On the basis of the thermodynamic activity coefficients, <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">46</ref> it would seem that benzene, toluene, and styrene (but not the higher alkylbenzenes) dissolve in [BMPy][BF 4 ]. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) does not mix with ionic liquids, such as [BMIm][PF 6 ] and [OMIm][BF 4 ] but is absorbed in the ionic liquid phase in huge amounts (up to a molar fraction of 0.7). <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">47</ref> No ionic liquid dissolves in the CO 2 phase.</p><p xml:id="_4kcZyVb">Summarizing, a theoretical basis for predicting the solvent properties of ionic liquids still has to be constructed. It has become clear, however, that ionic liquids do not fit into any of the standard heuristics that chemists traditionally use to assess and predict solvent behavior. What can be predicted, though, is that the characteristic property of some ionic liquids to mix neither with water nor with moderately nonpolar organic solvents will revolutionize process design.</p></div>

The evident reservation here is that the ionic liquids themselves should be harmless, since any compound that is used on a large scale will find its way into the environment. The ionic liquids types that are used in biocatalysis research have not been designed for biocompatibility, however, nor for easy biodegradability.

This structure, which is a prerequisite for activity, is maintained by disulfide bridges, hydrogen bonding (including water networks), and hydrophobic interaction. This latter effect is not really an interaction, apart from some slight Van der Waals contribution, but rather is the entropy-driven exclusion of hydrophobic groups from contact with water, which causes these to be buried in the protein structure. Even under physiological conditions, the stability margin of dissolved proteins is only a precarious 20-60 kJ mol -1 . <ref type="bibr">57</ref> Unfolding requires the dissociation of many hydrogen bonds at the same time and brings the buried hydrophobic groups into contact with the solvent. Consequently, proteins are destabilized by compounds that interact specifically with the unfolded protein. It is widely accepted, on the basis of deactivation kinetics, that unfolding proceeds through two stages: a reversible first stage, followed by a slower, irreversible step.</p><p xml:id="_78ygMBy">Water, the natural medium of enzyme catalysis, interacts sufficiently strongly to dissolve enzymes, but not strong enough to dissociate the structural hydrogen bonds. It should be noted that enzyme solutions in pure water are often unstable, which is why they are commonly kept in phosphate or citrate buffers. This latter stabilizing effect can be ascribed to "salting out" of hydrophobic groups, which increases the energy barrier to unfolding and exposure of such groups. Enzyme dehydration, for example by lyophilization, causes structural changes that have been confirmed spectroscopically. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">59</ref> These can be ascribed to Coulombic interactions between charged groups, which are up to 80 times stronger in a low dielectric constant medium than in water, as well as to loss of water networks. The combined effects usually are a general tightening of the structure. A detailed FT-IR study of Candida antarctica lipase B (CaLB), for example, showed that β-sheets increased at the expense of R-helices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">60</ref> Lyoprotectants, such as sucrose or trehalose, stabilize the native structure while lyophilizing.</p></div>

This latter characteristic is at the basis of the successful application of such hydrolases in nonhydrolytic reactions, such as the (enantioselective) acylation of alcohols and amines, which now are major industrial applications. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">65</ref> Interference of organic media, including ionic liquids, with enzyme activity is often discussed in terms of removal of essential water. Many enzymes indeed require a full hydration shell to be active, but there are numerous exceptions, such as CaLB, which maintains its activity upon drying over phosphorus pentoxide, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">66</ref> and the protease subtilisin, which requires only a few tightly bound water molecules per molecule of enzyme to be active. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">67</ref> It is now commonly accepted that water requirements should be discussed in terms of the thermodynamic water activity a w rather than water concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">64</ref> It should be noted that performing nonhydrolytic reactions with lipases or proteases in the presence of small amounts of water, to maintain or improve the activity, will nearly always give rise to hydrolytic side reactions. The resulting acid may cause the pH to drift and the enzyme to lose its activity.</p><p xml:id="_hkTJyvn">The solvents that are tolerated well by these hydrolasess aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and alcohols (excluding methanol)-interact only weakly, and one would surmise that these are more or less like a vacuum to the enzyme. Only alcohols, which are H-bond donors and acceptors, are known to inhibit lipases. Solvents that do interact strongly with proteins, such as DMSO and DMF, even to the extent of dissolving them, also tend to cause irreversible loss of activity. Thus, our starting hypothesis is that enzymes do not tolerate strong interactions with any solvent, except water.</p><p xml:id="_2AyCcBW">A complicating factor in nonaqueous enzymology is that the pH is undefined. It has been shown that enzymes tend to maintain the charge distribution (apparent pH) corresponding with the last aqueous solution, the lyophilization buffer, for example. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">61</ref> The optimum apparent pH may shift under the influence of the solvent type and a w , however. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">68</ref> Similar effects would be expected in ionic liquid media.</p><p xml:id="_5hgBY5g">The general desire to improve the low turnover rate of enzymes in organic media was a major driving force for extending the method to ionic liquids. These low (compared with aqueous medium) turnover rates are mainly, but not exclusively, caused by reactant stabilization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">63</ref> This latter effect, which is equivalent with increased solubility, is translated kinetically into an increase in K m and can be remedied by performing reactions at increased concentrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">69</ref> The remaining rate loss, 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, is ascribed to the combined effects of destabilization of the transition state, <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70</ref> conformational changes, and loss of flexibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70</ref> Transition state destabilization is caused by the low dielectric constant of common organic media, which increases the energy of the highly polarized transition state in comparison with water. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">70</ref> Thus, the expectation that ionic liquids, on the basis of their highly polar nature, could remedy the transition state destabilization, the conformational change caused by dehydration, and the loss of flexibility seemed by no means unreasonable.</p><p xml:id="_m4rAbc6">Many modes of biocatalysis in ionic liquids have been demonstrated. Mixed aqueous-ionic liquid media have been usedsto improve the solubility of hydrophobic reactants and products. Monophasic ionic liquids with little or no water present have been employed, as well as biphasic ionic liquid-scCO 2 media. In such solvent systems, the biocatalyst is in direct contact with the ionic liquid. There is little or no such contact, in contrast, when reactions are conducted in biphasic aqueous-ionic liquid or ionic liquid-organic media; hence, enzyme-ionic liquid incompatibilities are not to be expected. One exception concerns biotransformations with living cells, since ionic liquids, even when they are in a separate phase, may be toxic to the cells.</p><p xml:id="_MyrcqM4">In the following section, the interactions of aqueous electrolyte solutions and enzymes will be briefly introduced, followed by reviews of activity and stability studies concerning enzymes and ionic liquid-water mixtures, enzymes in ionic liquids with little or no water present, and biotransformations with living cells in aqueous ionic liquid media.</p></div>

Micro-osmotic effects cause a readjustment of the water equilibrium toward low-density water. With chaotropic ions, such as ClO 4 -, PF 6 -, NH 4 + , and Cs + , the situation is reversed. These interact weakly with water because their charge density is low, partition into low-density water, and shift the water equilibrium toward high-density water. Enzyme solutions are stabilized by kosmotropic anions and chaotropic cations, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, but are destabilized by chaotropic anions and kosmotropic cations.

The stability and activity of enzymes in aqueous ionic liquids are often discussed in terms of Hofmeister effects. We emphasize, however, that the cations in common ionic liquids do not easily fit into the kosmotropicity vs chaotropicity pattern set out above. The tetrabutylammonium ion, for example, should be a strong chaotrope, with a predicted B-coefficient of -0.54 on account of its charge density, <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">74</ref> whereas the experimental value is +1.27 (between Sr 2+ and Ca 2+ ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">76</ref> This latter effect is caused by the clathrate shell of highly ordered water that encloses hydrophobic solutes and has been likened to an iceberg; <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">81</ref> the resulting increase in low-density water, proportional with the size of the solute, translates into a kosmotropic effect on viscosity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">82</ref> An early study of the alkaline phosphatase from E. coli in aqueous mixtures of [EtNH 3 ][NO 3 ]swhich is also the oldest ionic liquid on record <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">83</ref> srevealed an activating effect at low concentrations, reaching an optimum at 1.1 M (10%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">84</ref> The activity steeply decreased at higher concentrations but was recovered upon dilution to 1.1 M.

A high activity recovery in such a procedure only proves that any changes of the enzyme in the storage medium are reversible. Alternatively, the preincubation time before performing a reaction in the same medium can be varied or the enzyme's structure in the medium of choice can be monitored spectroscopically. Thus, it was shown, using fluorescence spectrometry, that the unfolding temperature of the sweet-tasting protein monellin increased from 40 °C in water to 105 °C in [BMPrl][NTf 2 ]. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">154</ref> Finally, there is operational stability: activity over time under the reaction conditions.</p><p xml:id="_duvZu9q">The storage stability of cyt c in aqueous buffer is modest, but solutions in [HOEtMe 3 N][H 2 PO 4 ] or [BMPrl][H 2 PO 4 ] maintained their activity for at least 6 months.

Any structural change requires a considerable number of hydrogen bonds to dissociate at the same time, which may contribute significantly to enzyme stability and could also explain hydration-memory and hysteresis effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">69</ref> It is commonly observed that enzymes, when suspended in an organic solvent, maintain their activity over a longer period than when dissolved in aqueous buffer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">64</ref> The obvious reason is that breaking and remaking hydrogen bonds is bound to be slower in a non-hydrogen bond forming medium. It should be kept in mind, however, that the hydrophobic effect, which significantly contributes to protein stabilization, does not exist in organic solvents. Summarizing, organic media reduce the thermodynamic stability of enzymes but enhance the kinetic stability and this latter effect predominates. This overall stabilizing effect is still more pronounced in ionic liquids.</p><p xml:id="_MJyYGvV">It is worth noting here the common experience that solvents that are tolerated when nearly anhydrous or in dilute aqueous solution, such as ACN or tert-butyl alcohol, cause deactivation at an intermediate concentration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">164</ref> A similar conclusion can be distilled from experiments with enzymes in ionic liquids. The obvious explanation is that the hydrophobic effect decreases in the presence of a solvent. Consequently, the stability margin of the enzyme is eroded until, at a certain concentration, deactivation results.</p><p xml:id="_rBbW5Av">With regard to the compatibility of enzymes and anhydrous ionic liquids, hydrogen bonding could be the key to understanding. Ionic liquids, in particular their anions, that form strong hydrogen bonds may dissociate the hydrogen bonds that maintain the structural integrity of the R-helices and β-sheets, causing the protein to unfold wholly or partially. The lactate ion, for example, could easily form stable hydrogen bonds with the polypeptide backbone. Ion size could matter because sterically demanding ions would require many hydrogen bonds to be broken to create a few new ones, which could contribute to maintaining stability.</p><p xml:id="_WwGb2eb">We have already noted that the deactivation of CaLB by [BMIm][NO 3 ], for example, is partially reversible. This finding is in agreement with the generally adopted kinetic model of enzyme deactivation, which involves a reversible first step and an irreversible second one. CaLB deactivation by [BMIm][dca], in contrast, was irreversible and a small angle neutron scattering experiment indicated the formation of aggregates, <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">165</ref> as is often observed upon unfolding. Presumably, hydrogen bonds also maintain the conformation of reversibly deactivated enzymes. Reconstitution requires these hydrogen bonds to be dissociated and remade into the native ones. Dilute denaturants often facilitate reconstitution, which includes denaturing ionic liquids, as discussed above. Presumably, such strongly hydrogen bonding compounds facilitate the reconstitution by forming transient hydrogen bonds.</p></div>

The highest rates were found in It could be surmised, for example, that blocking the mildly acidic position at C-2 in the imidazolium ring with a methyl group would obviate undesirable interactions with the amine reactant, but no such systematic effect became apparent, as such ionic liquids were involved in both the fastest and the slowest reactions. Amine 35 was resolved with a quite modest enantiomeric ratio of 2-3, which is not surprising, as the nitrogen atom is separated from the chiral center by a methylene group.

There is hardly an ionic liquid that is not tolerated by any enzyme, and the impression is that ionic liquids are generally tolerated to higher concentrations than water-miscible molecular solvents.</p><p xml:id="_uG3ZyyN">Many hydrolases, particularly those that tolerate conventional organic solvents, are eminently capable of performing nonhydrolytic reactions in ionic liquids. Activities are generally comparable with or higher than those observed in conventional organic solvents. Furthermore, enhanced thermal and operational stabilities and regio-or enantioselectivities have been observed in many cases. Enzyme-compatible ionic liquids generally do not interact strongly with the enzyme or cause the latter to dissolve. A notable exception to this latter rule is an ionic liquid that passed the ultimate enzyme compatibility test by dissolving enzymes while their activity is maintained. There is, as yet, no theoretical basis for predicting the compatibility of ionic liquids, aqueous or anhydrous, and enzymes, but we expect that the intensity of the interest in the subject will cause one to be developed soon.</p><p xml:id="_wwzKes5">Ionic liquids have obvious potential as reaction media for biotransformations of highly polar substrates, such as (poly)saccharides, which cannot be performed in water, owing to equilibrium limitations. Such replacement of volatile media by nonvolatile ionic liquids will doubtlessly continue, will gradually be adopted by the chemical industry, and will contribute to the efficiency of the latter. The development of less expensive ionic liquids will also further stimulate their use in industrial biotransformations.</p><p xml:id="_cW5hUYK">A much more fundamental contribution to the greening of industrial biocatalysis is to be expected from innovative reaction methodologies, downstream processing, and biocatalyst recycling, based on the unique solvent properties of ionic liquids and combinations of ionic liquids and supercritial carbon dioxide. Furthermore, it is to be expected that ionic liquid-based solvent systems will have enormous potential in multicatalyst transformations. Work toward these ends has only just started.</p><p xml:id="_39vDUNY">We confidently expect that green and biocompatible ionic liquids will become available soon, as is absolutely required for ionic liquids to contribute to a greener chemical industry. In short, we believe that biotransformations in ionic liquids hold much promise for the future.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b254">239</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,54.56,133.76,239.52,8.08;2,54.56,143.24,82.56,8.08;2,77.94,48.07,192.72,73.80"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc xml:id="_avuDFSd">Figure 1.
