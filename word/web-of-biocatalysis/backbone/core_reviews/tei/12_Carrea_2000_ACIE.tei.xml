<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_MQTcumZ">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_h5CKRvZ">In recent years, the employment of biocatalysts for organic synthesis has become an increasingly attractive alternative to conventional chemical methods. <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> In fact, enzymes quite often display high chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity, which makes these catalysts especially attractive for the pharmaceutical and agrochemical areas, where the interest for enantiomerically pure and specifically functionalized compounds is continuously growing. Furthermore, enzyme-catalyzed reactions are normally carried out under mild conditions, such as room temperature and neutral or almost neutral pH, which minimizes problems of product isomerization, racemization, or epimerization. In addition, enzymes can be very efficient catalysts, capable of increasing reaction rates by up to 10 12 times. Finally, biocatalytic processes are less hazardous, polluting, and energy consuming than conventional chemistry-based methodologies, especially those making use of heavy-metal catalysts.</p><p xml:id="_YTZmY7N">All these reasons have made biocatalysis a popular topic for research in academia and industry and a tremendous number of enzymes have been described in the literature with a claimed potential for practical exploitation. For instance, the database BioCatalysis, based on 8000 articles and patents, describes 18 500 biotransformations carried out with enzymes, microorganisms, and catalytic antibodies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[2]</ref> Clearly, most of the described conversions are bound to remain mere laboratory curiosities, but an important part of them already has, or will have, an industrial application.</p><p xml:id="_GE2Ekzb">Unfortunately, there are also some drawbacks, such as the sometimes unsatisfactory stability of the enzymes and/or their laborious isolation and poor productivity. However, the improvement of purification procedures and the use of immobilized or engineered enzymes are progressively reduc-Properties and Synthetic Applications of Enzymes in Organic Solvents Giacomo Carrea* and Sergio Riva*   Biotransformations already represent an effective and sometimes preferable alternative to chemical synthesis for the production of fine chemicals and optically active compounds. To further widen the versatility of the biological approach, the so-called ªnonaqueous enzymologyº, which now represents an important area of research and biotechnological development, has emerged in the last ten years or so. This new methodology is especially suitable for the modification of precursors of pharmaceutical compounds and fine chemicals, which, in most cases, are insoluble or poorly soluble in water. Even though the idea of carrying out an enzymatic process in organic solvent was initially considered with scepticism, biocatalysis in such media is now investigated and exploit-ed in numerous academic and industrial laboratories. One of the reasons that makes enzymatic catalysis in nonaqueous media so appealing, is the important new properties that enzymes exhibit in organic solvents. For example, they are often more stable and can catalyze reactions that are impossible or difficult in water. Furthermore, enzyme selectivity can also differ from that in water and can change, or even reverse, from one solvent to another. This phenomenon, which can be called ªmedium engineeringº, can be exploited as a valid alternative to protein engineering. The first part of this review examines the thermodynamic, kinetic, spectroscopic, and physical approaches that have been adopted to investigate the factors that affect activity, stability, structure, and selectivity of enzymes in organic solvents. These combined studies have brought the understanding of enzyme catalysis in organic solvents to a level almost comparable to that reached for biocatalysis in aqueous media. The second part surveys a number of the synthetic applications of enzymes in organic media, which span from the preparation of milligrams of specifically labeled compounds to the modification of fats on multiton scale and from the preparation of complex key intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry to the synthesis of polymers.</p><p xml:id="_yc7AqsJ">ing the incidence of these limitations. Another disadvantage, caused by the limited water solubility of many organic substrates, is that reagent concentrations are generally lower in biocatalytic than in chemical processes; this, of course, leads to larger reaction volumes and complicates product recovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2." xml:id="_69ASZqf">Organic Solvent Systems</head><p xml:id="_du6kMED">Among the various methods adopted to increase the solubility of hydrophobic substrates in biocatalyzed reactions, the most obvious and widely employed is that based on organic solvents. This includes the use of mixtures of water and water-miscible organic solvents, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[3]</ref> biphasic systems consisting of water and water-immiscible organic solvents (see the pioneering work by Sym <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[4]</ref> and some more recent reviews <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> ), reverse micellar systems, <ref type="bibr">[5f, 6]</ref> and, finally, organic solvent systems. <ref type="bibr">[5f, 7]</ref> Some features of the various systems that could help in understanding their peculiarities are represented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_bF69cE3">Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Representations of some organic solvent systems. a) Two-phase system, b) inverse micellular system, c) organic solvent system. Shaded areas: organic phase, white areas: water phase, black dots: biocatalyst.</p><p xml:id="_dJZadWY">In biphasic systems (a), the enzymes and hydrophilic compounds are contained in the aqueous phase, where the reaction occurs, while hydrophobic compounds are mostly partitioned in the organic phase. In reverse micellar systems (b), enzyme molecules are solubilized in discrete, hydrated, reverse micelles, formed by surfactants, within a continuous phase of a hydrophobic organic solvent. Under appropriate conditions, the reverse micellar solution is homogeneous, thermodynamically stable, and optically transparent. In organic solvent systems (c), solid enzyme preparations (for example, enzymes lyophilized or adsorbed on an inert support) are suspended in an organic solvent in the presence of enough aqueous buffer (as a rule of thumb &lt; 5 % v/v) to ensure enzymatic activity. Although the amount of water added to the solvent may exceed its solubility in that solvent, a visible discrete aqueous phase is not apparent because part of the solvent in the system is adsorbed by the biocatalyst. Visually, the two phases involved in an organic solvent system are liquid (bulk organic solvent and reagents dissolved in it) and solid (hydrated enzyme particles).</p><p xml:id="_rS5SfxR">Even though each of the systems described above has pros and cons, <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref> the organic solvent system is the one which has been most deeply investigated and widely applied and, in this review, we shall exclusively focus on this system. Several advantages account for the interest in this kind of enzymecatalyzed reaction and for its success, such as: 1) the catalysis of reactions that are unfavorable in water is possible (for example, the reversal of hydrolysis reactions in favor of synthesis), 2) water-induced side reactions, such as hydrolysis of acid anhydrides and halogenate esters, can be suppressed, 3) hydrophobic substrates can be solubilized, Giacomo Carrea, born in Tortona (Italy) in 1943, graduated in chemistry at the University of Pavia in 1968. In 1969 he joined the Centro Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR) where he is presently Director of the Istituto di Biocatalisi e Riconoscimento Molecolare (IBRM). He has been working in such fields as enzyme catalysis in organic solvents, synthesis of fine chemicals catalyzed by hydrolases, dehydrogenases, peroxidases, and monooxygenases, the study of the conformation of proteins and polypeptides, and analytical applications of bioluminescent enzymes. He is a member of the Editorial Boards of Trends in Biotechnology and Biocatalysis and Biotransformation and the author of approximately 170 publications.</p><p xml:id="_wEP37EZ">Sergio Riva, born in Milan (Italy) in 1958, is a Senior Research Scientist at the IBRM (Istituto di Biocatalisi e Riconoscimento Molecolare), where he has been working since 1984. He took his Laurea in chemistry at the University of Milan in 1983 and his Diploma di SpecialitaÂ in organic synthesis at the Politecnico of Milan in 1989. In 1987, he spent one year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, USA) working with Prof. A. Klibanov. In 1993 he was awarded the Ciamician medal by the Organic Chemical Division of the Italian Chemical Society. His research activity is documented by more than 100 publications reporting on the isolation and characterization of enzymes belonging to different classes (hydrolases, dehydrogenases, oxynitrilases, glycosyltransferases) and on the use of these biocatalysts for the mild and selective modification of different natural compounds (steroids, alkaloids, terpenes, sugars, and natural glycosides).</p><p xml:id="_XyX7CUY">4) some products can be easily recovered, 5) the insoluble biocatalysts can be easily recovered, 6) biocatalyst thermostability is increased, at least at low water levels. Furthermore, enzyme selectivity can be markedly influenced, and even reversed, by the solvent; this sort of solvent engineering thus provides an alternative to protein engineering. Organic solvent systems are also useful for fundamental studies of the effects of water on enzyme dynamics and catalysis.</p><p xml:id="_6h8jBZF">In the following sections the properties and synthetic applications of enzymes in organic solvents will be examined.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3." xml:id="_mJ4nSyv">Enzyme Properties in Organic Solvents</head><p xml:id="_HdsfV8S">Thermodynamic, kinetic, spectroscopic, and physical approaches have all contributed to improve the understanding of the factors affecting activity, stability, structure, and selectivity of enzymes in organic solvents; this understanding is now being developed to a level almost comparable to that of biocatalysis in aqueous media.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1." xml:id="_KPfUkQe">Enzyme Activity</head><p xml:id="_JGDtH8k">Enzyme activity in organic solvents depends dramatically on such parameters as water activity, substrate ± product solvation, pH control, enzyme form, and the nature of the solvent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1." xml:id="_SngnDCE">Water Activity</head><p xml:id="_hKpZ8QP">It became apparent quite soon that enzyme activity was higher in hydrophobic solvents than in hydrophilic ones and, indeed, Laane et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[9]</ref> found that there was a direct correlation between activity and solvent hydrophobicity, expressed as log P (where P is the partition coefficient of a given solvent between n-octanol and water). The authors ascribed this result to differences in the ability of organic solvents to distort the essential water layer around the biocatalysts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[9]</ref> Shortly afterwards, Zaks and Klibanov <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[10]</ref> demonstrated, with the three unrelated enzymes yeast alcohol oxidase, mushroom polyphenol oxidase, and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, that enzyme activity was more or less coincident in the various solvents, provided that the amount of water bound to the enzyme was the same. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2 a</ref> shows that the more hydrophilic the solvent is, the higher the water content of the solvent has to be to reach high activity. This happens because the water content of the enzyme (W e , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2 b</ref>) and not that of the solvent (W S , Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2 a</ref>) is what actually matters for activity. Thus, depending on the hydrophobicity of the solvent, the same water content results in entirely different amounts of water on the enzyme. These data suggest that the effects of organic solvents on an enzyme are primarily due to interactions with the essential enzyme-bound layer of water rather than with the enzyme itself. The maximal enzymatic activity for the three examined enzymes was attained at about 1000 molecules of water per enzyme molecule, that is, roughly a monolayer of water on the surface, as had already been found for activity recovery, in air, of dry lysozyme <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[11]</ref> and chymotrypsin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[12]</ref> It should be mentioned that at optimal water contents, enzymatic activities in organic solvents of alcohol oxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were in the range from 20 to 40 % of those in aqueous solutions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[10]</ref> Different degrees of water stripping as a function of solvent polarity were found and quantified by direct measurement of tritiated water desorption from enzymes; water stripping occurred nearly immediately when the enzyme was suspended in organic solvents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[13]</ref> A more rigorous way to correlate enzyme activity with the water present in the reaction medium was proposed by Halling <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[14]</ref> and Goderis et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[15]</ref> who expressed the water in the medium not in terms of content but of thermodynamic water activity. Water activity (a w ) is correlated to the mole fraction of water (c w ) and the water activity coefficient (g w ) by the equation a w g w c w . Since, in the first approximation, the water activity coefficient (g w ) increases as a function of solvent hydrophobicity, it is obvious that a given value of a w will be obtained at a lower water concentration in a hydrophobic medium than in a hydrophilic medium. Therefore, to attain the same level of enzyme hydration, or of a w , in the enzyme, less water is necessary in hydrophobic than hydrophilic solvents. To clarify the water activity concept, Bell et al. <ref type="bibr">[7i]</ref> suggested that a w is like temperature, while water content is like heat content. Two systems can have the same a w or temperature, but at the same time differ in the water content or heat content. It should be mentioned that, at equilibrium, a w will be the same for all the components of the reaction system, such as, catalyst, matrix (in the case of immobilized enzymes <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> ), reagents, and solvents.</p><p xml:id="_YtNdQju">The existence of a direct correlation between enzyme activity and the a w of the system, was clearly demonstrated in the case of Mucor miehei lipase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[17]</ref> The lipase showed a similar optimum of activity at a w 0.55 when used in solvents varying in polarity from hexane to pentanone (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 a</ref>). The absolute reaction rates were somewhat solvent dependent, but the shape of the profile was essentially unchanged. Of course, the optimum varied widely when activity was plotted against water concentration in the organic solvents (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3 b</ref>). In a study carried out with lipases from five different sources, it was also found that the dependence of catalytic activity on a w varied significantly from enzyme to enzyme, possibly as a consequence of molecular structure differences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[18]</ref> A recent study has shown that, contrary to what was observed with nonpolar solvents, with polar solvents such as dioxane, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, and acetone, a w fails to precisely predict the critical hydration level for enzyme activity; this probably reflects direct solvent effects on the enzyme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[19]</ref> The increase of a w or water content can induce an increase of K m values. <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> This is especially true for the K m of nucleophiles in hydrolase-catalyzed esterification and transesterification reactions, where water acts as an inhibitor by competing with the substrate for the acyl ± enzyme intermediate. <ref type="bibr">[20b±d]</ref> This phenomenon is exemplified in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, where the effect of water concentration on the K m,app of subtilisin for the nucleophile 1-hexanol is shown. As expected, the K m,app for the acylating agent vinyl butyrate was not affected. Similarly, a w influences the equilibrium of hydrolase-catalyzed esterifications or transesterifications because water favors the reverse reaction (hydrolysis of the product) in the case of esterifications or the hydrolysis of the acylating agent (activated esters or enol esters and acid anhydrides) and, again, of the product in the case of transesterifications. <ref type="bibr">[14c, 21]</ref> Due to the fundamental role played by water, it is clear that the control of a w in the enzymatic reactions carried out in organic solvents is of paramount importance and, as a consequence, different methods have been developed to this end. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr">22]</ref> Goderis et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[15]</ref> used the knowledge that some salts have a fixed hydration state which gives a well-defined a w , <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[23]</ref> and employed saturated salt solutions to equilibrate, through the gas phase, organic solvent reactions. The method can be used to adjust a w not only initially, but also during a reaction in which water is produced or consumed. <ref type="bibr">[22a,b]</ref> The disadvantage of the method is that water transfer is influenced by the design of the equilibration chambers. Another method for a w control is based on the use of salt hydrates which can act as a w buffers in organic media; however, they have limited capacity and require additional separation steps if they (and/or the enzymes) are to be reused. <ref type="bibr">[22c,d]</ref> More promising, especially for preparative-scale applications, seems to be a recently described method in which a w control is exerted by circulating salt solutions in silicone tubing submerged in the organic solvent. <ref type="bibr">[22e]</ref> The silicone membranes are permeable to water vapors and impermeable to ions; therefore, only water is transferred through them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2." xml:id="_hQ8B2Wp">Kinetics</head><p xml:id="_Dhs2eBr">Kinetic studies carried out mostly with hydrolases, have shown that enzymes in organic solvents follow conventional models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[24]</ref> Thus, various transesterification reactions catalyzed by porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) in hexane obey Michaelis ± Menten kinetics <ref type="bibr">[24a]</ref> and those catalyzed by lipases from Mucor miehei <ref type="bibr">[24b]</ref> and Candida antarctica <ref type="bibr">[24c]</ref> follow a bibi ping-pong mechanism, with competitive inhibition by substrates and products. The identity of the mechanism of subtilisin-catalyzed ester hydrolysis in water and transesterification in organic solvents has been demonstrated by <ref type="bibr">Chatterjee and Russel,</ref><ref type="bibr">[24d,</ref><ref type="bibr">e]</ref> who have also determined individual rate constants and equilibrium constants of the reaction in organic solvents.</p><p xml:id="_URyDnnJ">Considering kinetic parameters in organic solvents, the values may be very different from solvent to solvent and from those for the same enzyme and substrate in aqueous media; similarly, substrate specificity may change dramatically from solvent to solvent and from water. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>, for example, shows that N-acetyl-l-serine ethyl ester (N-Ac-l-Ser-OEt) is the preferred substrate of subtilisin in dichloromethane, while in tert-butylamine the preferred substrate is N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine ethyl ester (N-Ac-l-Phe-OEt). <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[25]</ref> However, all these effects can be at least partly explained by different solvation of the substrates as the reaction medium changes. <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref> Different methods are available to correct for solvation of substrates (and products). As discussed by Janssen et al., <ref type="bibr">[26f]</ref> one of them is based on a transfer of free energy method, where the activation (or binding) energy is calculated from experimental data for v max /K m (or K m ). <ref type="bibr">[26a,b]</ref> This experimental activation (or binding) energy and the transfer of free energy of the substrate, are used to calculate the corrected activation (or binding) energy. Another method of correction is to express the kinetic constants in terms of thermodynamic activities instead of concentrations. <ref type="bibr">[26c,d]</ref> A third method is to correct the Michaelis constant by using partition coefficients. In this case, the experimental K m , which is based on substrates concentration in the organic phase, is corrected to a K m value which is based on the concentrations in the aqueous phase. <ref type="bibr">[26e]</ref> These three methods of correction are essentially equivalent and, once applied, give similar kinetic parameters in the various media <ref type="bibr">[7h]</ref> and explain the differences of substrate specificity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[24]</ref> 3.1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3." xml:id="_3sCGAxC">pH Value and pH Control</head><p xml:id="_vDWhNGN">The protonation state of the various groups of an enzyme is undoubtedly important for enzyme activity, both in aqueous and organic media. However, while protonation in water is simply controlled by adjustments of pH values, this is not the case in organic solvents, where even the concept of pH value itself is challenged. <ref type="bibr">[14c]</ref> A way to control the initial state of enzyme protonation and, hence, activity was developed by <ref type="bibr">Zaks and Klibanov,</ref><ref type="bibr">[24a]</ref> who showed that enzyme activity in organic solvents was markedly dependent on the pH value of the solution from which the enzyme was recovered (by lyophilization or precipitation). This methodology, which is now widely applied in the field of biocatalysis in organic solvents, is perfectly suitable when there is no alteration of acid/base concentration in the course of the reaction. If this is not the case, as in the synthesis, hydrolysis, or aminolysis of esters, for instance, the enzyme protonation and activity may change during reaction.</p><p xml:id="_sm4fmnT">To overcome this drawback, the use of buffering systems involving highly hydrophobic acids and their sodium salts, and highly hydrophobic bases and their hydrochlorides, has been proposed. <ref type="bibr">[27]</ref> Indeed, these systems can efficiently buffer organic solvent media, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> where the dependence of subtilisin activity on the composition of some acids pairs and their conjugated bases is shown.

The use of small enzyme particles obtained by prior sonication and vigorous shaking or stirring during reaction are recommended to alleviate these disadvantages. In some cases, ultrasonic treatment has also been done during the reaction and this has notably increased reaction rates. <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref> Rate enhancements were attributed to the increase of catalyst surface area (better dispersion) or to locally high pressures. <ref type="bibr">[30b]</ref> That aggregation can limit enzyme efficiency was also suggested by the finding that chymotrypsin and subtilisin activities in ethanol were inversely correlated to enzyme concentration in the medium. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[31]</ref> Russell and co-workers have calculated the role of internal and external mass transfer and found that enzyme particles suspended in organic solvents will be subjected to increasing diffusion limitations as the enzyme activity and particle size increase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[32]</ref> Enzyme lyophilization in the presence of ligands, lyoprotectants (various sugars, polyethylene glycol), salts, and micellar amphiphiles has often yielded preparations that are markedly more active than those obtained in the absence of additives. <ref type="bibr">[20d, 33]</ref> Various explanations such as ªtrappingº of the enzyme in a more active conformation (ligands and micellar amphiphiles), <ref type="bibr">[33a,f]</ref> prevention of lyophilization-induced partial denaturation of the enzyme that becomes irreversible in organic solvents (lyoprotectants), <ref type="bibr">[33c]</ref> protection against deactivation by direct contact with the solvent (salts), <ref type="bibr">[33d]</ref> retention of the water shell around the enzyme (sorbitol), <ref type="bibr">[33e]</ref> or increased catalyst dispersion in the medium (various additives) have been invoked to rationalize the results. <ref type="bibr">[20d]</ref> Adsorption on solid matrices, which improves, at least at optimal protein/support ratios, enzyme dispersion, reduces diffusional limitations and favors substrate access to individual enzyme molecules. Matrices with different particle size, porosity, and composition (Celite, controlled pore glass, polyamide, polypropylene, alumina, silica, zirconia) were employed and the pros and cons evaluated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[34]</ref> A common feature is that for each enzyme and matrix there is an optimal enzyme/support ratio for expression of activity.

When the rate per unit weight of lipase was considered (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5 b</ref>), the highest value was still obtained at an enzyme loading of 150 mg per g Celite and then it decreased. These data suggest that at low loadings the enzyme undergoes conformational modifications and inactivation caused by strong interactions with the matrix, <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[35]</ref> whereas, at high loading, diffusional limitations or substrate inaccessibility to the active site reduce enzyme effectiveness. Inactivation at low enzyme loading can be prevented by carrying out the immobilization in the presence of extraneous proteins (albumin, gelatin, casein) or polyethylene glycol. <ref type="bibr">[34c]</ref> Immobilized lipases with excellent activity and stability were obtained by entrapping the enzymes in hydrophobic sol- The relative rate is given once as mg of whole material (lipase plus Celite, a) and once as mg of lipase only (b).

The most widespread method is based on the covalent linking of the amphiphilic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enzyme molecules. In this way, a large number of PEG ± enzyme complexes have been prepared and they have been shown to give transparent solutions in several organic solvents. <ref type="bibr">[20d, 38]</ref> Transparent enzyme solutions can also be obtained with non-covalent PEG ± enzyme complexes simply prepared by lyophilization of the enzyme in the presence of an excess of PEG. <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref> In both cases, excellent activity in organic solvents was often obtained. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr">39]</ref> Enzyme complexes with anionic or non-ionic surfactants that dissolve in organic solvents have been described by several groups. <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> For example, chymotrypsin and subtilisin complexed with Aerosol OT (10 % w/v solution of bis (2ethylhexyl)sodium sulfosuccinate in water) and dissolved in isooctane in the absence of reversed micelles, showed k cat values nearly one-third and two-thirds as high as in aqueous buffer, respectively. <ref type="bibr">[40a]</ref> Similarly, the lipid-coated lipase from Pseudomonas fragi (Lipase B) was found to be twice as active as PEG-grafted enzyme and one hundred times more active than the enzyme powder in the esterification of 1-phenylethanol in isooctane (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). <ref type="bibr">[40d]</ref> The activities of different forms of lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia have been compared in carbon tetrachloride and the data are shown in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. <ref type="bibr">[39b]</ref> The most active form was the lipase entrapped in the sol-gel matrices, while the crystallized and cross-linked enzyme was less active.

Various hypotheses have been formulated to rationalize this phenomenon. For instance, the solvent, depending on its polarity, could modify the enzyme conformation and, thus, influence the selectivity by altering the molecular recognition process between substrate and enzyme. <ref type="bibr">[54a]</ref> According to another theory, selectivity depends on the energetics of substrate solvation, <ref type="bibr">[54b]</ref> whereas a third model envisages that solvent molecules could bind within the active site and, depending on their structure, interfere with the association or transformation of one enantiomer more than with that of the other. <ref type="bibr">[54d, 56]</ref> However, both the hypotheses based on the physicochemical properties of the solvents and that based on solvent structure are, at present, unsatisfactory from the point of view of predictive value.

Since this time, the enthusiastic statements of the pioneers of biocatalysis in nonnatural media have been experimentally verified in several research groups. Specifically, it has been proved true that many enzymes can work in organic solvents, even though it has also been observed that enzymes belonging to different classes need different hydration levels to maintain their catalytic activity, or at least a percentage of it. Additionally, although some enzymes can give really astonishing results, only few classes of these biocatalysts (such as lipases, proteases, oxynitrilases, and a few other enzymes) have proved to be synthetically useful from a practical point of view. These enzymes will be presented in the following paragraphs.</p><p xml:id="_qHEPaed">Other enzymes, such as dehydrogenases and glycosidases, despite their synthetic importance, have found limited or no practical applications so far. This is mainly because they either act on polar substrates or coenzymes that are poorly soluble in organic solvents, or because they are inhibited or inactivated by organic solvents. Another more general limitation arises from the fact that numerous biocatalysts are still too expensive or not commercially available at all.</p></div>

From a chemical point of view, lipases and proteases in organic solvents can be seen as mild and selective reagents that are able to activate a generic carboxylate and transfer it to a huge number of nucleophiles.

A more sophisticated three-dimensional active site model has recently been suggested for the same lipase, <ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[74]</ref> while a definite conclusion about the chiral preference of CRL has been drawn from the X-ray crystal structures of covalent complexes of this enzyme with transition-state analogues for the hydrolysis of menthyl esters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[75]</ref> As all the lipases and esterases tested so far catalyze the hydrolysis of the same enantiomer of menthol (the 1R enantiomer), it is likely that features common to all these enzymes must be responsible for the observed enantiopreference. A combination of empirical rules derived from substrate data bases and high resolution enzymatic X-ray data is likely to support synthetic applications of this methodology very effectively.</p><p xml:id="_7VTKDaJ">Finally, it has to be mentioned that, for steric reasons, hydrolases do not usually catalyse the transformation of tertiary alcohols, either in organic solvents or in aqueous solutions. An exception is given by the chloroacetate 3, whose propanolysis was effective when catalyzed by Mucor miehei lipase in isopropyl ether (E values ranging from 13 to 38) and gave the optically active alcohol with the (1S,6S) absolute configuration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[76]</ref> The other (few) reports are related to the hydrolysis of esters in aqueous solutions containing different amounts of organic cosolvents and therefore are beyond the object of this review. However, the approach suggested by Brackenridge et al. for the resolution of the alcohol 4 deserves to be mentioned, that is, the introduction of a spatial separation between the chiral quaternary carbon and the ester which has to be split during the reaction. In this specific example, the formation of an oxalate ester, 4 a, reduced the steric hindrance of the molecule and made it acceptable for different lipases. <ref type="bibr">[77a]</ref> In a similar approach, the stereoselective alcoholysis of the butanoyloxymetyl derivative 5 a of linalool (5) has been achieved by action of Candida rugosa lipase. <ref type="bibr">[77b]</ref> 4.1.1.2. Kinetic Resolution of Amines and Thiols <ref type="bibr">[1c±e, 61]</ref> Compared to the hydrolase-catalyzed resolutions of alcohols, the corresponding acylations of racemic amines and thiols are rare. In the first report on this subject, <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">[78]</ref> the kinetic resolution of various amines (for example, a-methylbenzylamine, 6) catalyzed by the protease subtilisin was achieved by modulating the organic medium. Later on, the specificity of three lipases were exploited; lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) is the most popular for this transformation, <ref type="bibr">[79]</ref> although the lipases from Pseudomonas cepacia <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">[80]</ref> and Pseudomonas aeruginosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">[81]</ref> have also been used. By comparing the literature experimental data, it is evident that the lipase-catalyzed aminolysis of esters needs a greater amount of enzyme and longer reaction times than the corresponding alcoholysis of esters, even though higher ee values are generally obtained. A likely explanation for this phenomenon has been suggested, as shown in Scheme 1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">[82]</ref> The rate of proton transfer from the acyl acceptor (RNH 2 or Scheme 1. Decomposition of the acyl ± enzyme intermediate by action of alcohols or amines.</p><p xml:id="_nbxX5Rh">ROH) to the His residue of the catalytic triad during the nucleophilic attack on the acyl ± enzyme complex is likely to be lower for a neutral amine, which has a significantly higher acid dissociation constant than the corresponding alcohol. On the other hand, the higher enantioselectivity can be explained by taking into account the low reactivity of the formed amides as substrates for lipases (these enzymes do not hydrolyse the peptidic bond in water). Despite the fact that more severe experimental conditions are necessary, the lipase-catalyzed resolution of racemic amines is presently the most successful application of enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents (see Section 4.1.4.).</p><p xml:id="_HxFURmE">It has been pointed out <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[72]</ref> that proteases and lipases have opposite enantioselectivity. Accordingly, the protease subtilisin has been used for the production of the pharmaceutically important intermediate (R)-1-aminoindan (7) and the chiral resolving agent (R)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine (8). <ref type="bibr">[83]</ref> By using a continuous-flow reactor containing the enzyme adsorbed on porous glass beads for the kinetic resolution of these compounds, up to 330 g of racemic 7 and 1.6 kg of racemic 8 have been resolved to give 132 g of 7 (40 % yield from the racemate, 98 % ee) and 560 g of 8 (after crystallization of the corresponding hydrochloride, 35 % yield, &gt; 99 % ee; 95% ee prior to crystallization), respectively. Finally, some papers deserve to be mentioned which describe the enzymatic resolution of amines using as acyl donors acrylic esters (such as 9), <ref type="bibr">[84a]</ref> vinyl carbonates (such as 10), <ref type="bibr">[84b]</ref> homocarbonates (such as 11), <ref type="bibr">[84c]</ref> and cyanomethyl pent-4-enoate (12). <ref type="bibr">[84d]</ref> These examples begin to show the versatility of hydrolases towards different acyl donors, a property that will be further detailed in the Section 4.1.2.</p><p xml:id="_4tHpa2w">Little attention has been paid up to now to the enzymatic resolutions of thiols. The lipases from the porcine pancreas and Pseudomonas cepacia catalyzed the regio-and chemoselective alcoholysis of the thioesters 13 to the corresponding thiol with the (R) absolute configuration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">[85]</ref> Similarly, the thiooctanoate 14 was used as an acyl donor in a reaction catalyzed by CALB to give the corresponding (R)-thiol with &gt; 95 % ee. <ref type="bibr" target="#b186">[86]</ref> The direct enzymatic acylation of the racemic thiols was unsuccessful, for reasons that are still obviously related to the enzymatic mechanism. In fact, regarding the decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate (see Scheme 1), the best leaving group is, in this case, the thiol, which is less basic than the active site serine hydroxyl group. <ref type="bibr">[1c±e, 61]</ref> In principle, carboxylic acids in organic media can be enzymatically resolved in two ways, that is, either by hydrolase-catalysed esterification between an acid and an alcohol [Eq.

The best approach proved to be the transesterification reaction ([Eq. ( <ref type="formula">6</ref>)], R' Me, R'' Bu). Another example of this methodology is the kinetic resolution of the trans-glycidic methyl ester 18, whose (2R,3S)-enantiomer 18 a is a precursor of the calcium channel blocker drug diltiazem (19, Scheme 2). The enzymatic resolution has been achieved by a-chymotrypsin suspended in hexane/BuOH 9/1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[90]</ref> or by action of Candida rugosa lipase suspended in tert-amyl alcohol containing n-octanol (37 % yield, 88 % ee for the residual 18 a). <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[91]</ref> Similarly, the racemic trans-glycidic methyl ester 20 was resolved by action of Mucor miehei lipase in hexane in the presence of iBuOH (E 33, 42 % yield, 95 % ee for (À)-20; 43 % yield, 95 ee for the ()-20). <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">[92]</ref> Both enantiomers were then elaborated to obtain the taxol C-13 side chain. A disadvantage of the transesterification approach is the similar nature of the substrates and products, which leads to reaction mixtures containing compounds with similar physicochemical properties. As a consequence, serious problems can be encountered in scaling the reactions up if a chromatographic purification has to be avoided.

However an enzyme has the potential to discriminate any substrate stereocenter, no matter how remotely it is located from the catalytic site, since the whole active site of the enzyme is chiral. This property is synthetically very appealing, because the control of configurations of stereocenters remote from the chiral auxiliaries or catalysts applied in nonenzymatic methodology remains an unsolved problem. Despite that, the effects of distal chiral centers on the stereoselectivity of hydrolases has not been broadly studied and, consequently, not many examples have appeared in the literature. <ref type="bibr">[1j]</ref> Concerning transformations in organic solvents, the kinetic resolution of compound 24, a precursor of the a-tocopherol analogue MDL-73404, has been reported. Enzymatic acylation of 24 catalyzed by a lipase from Pseudomonas sp.

Dynamic Kinetic Resolution <ref type="bibr">[100]</ref> The main drawback of the kinetic resolutions described so far is that the maximum yield of one stereoisomer which can be obtained under ideal conditions is limited to 50 %. A possible approach to overcome this limitation is chemical elaboration of the crude mixture by enzymatic acylation. For instance, the stereochemical inversion of the residual alcohol with the Mitsunobu protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[101]</ref> has proved to be quite successful, as exemplified in Scheme 4. Following reduction of acetate ()-(R)-26 a with LiAlH 4 , the corresponding alcohol ()-(R)-26 was obtained with an optical purity of 87.5 % ee, which was increased to ! 99 % ee by a single crystallization (73 % overall yield from the starting racemic alcohol 26). <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">[101]</ref> A complementary approach is the so-called ªdynamic kinetic resolutionº (DKR). <ref type="bibr">[100]</ref> This process is a type of second order asymmetric transformation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">[102]</ref> and indicates any procedure which allows in situ racemization of the substrate prior to the enantioselective reaction, so that, in principle, a quantitative conversion of the starting material into a single stereoisomer of the product can be obtained. For DKR to be effective, the reactant isomers must be in rapid equilibrium, to make removal of one isomer the rate determining step (Scheme 5). As the enzyme always faces a racemic substrate during the reaction, the optical purity of the product becomes independent from the extent of conversion and depends only on the enantiomeric ratio E [Eq.

Conversely, changes in the A or B ring did not dramatically affect the acylation of steroids by subtilisin, confirming the preference of this protease for C-17 or sidechain hydroxyl groups. The performances of two other lipases, from Candida rugosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b267">[152]</ref> and from Candida antarctica, <ref type="bibr" target="#b268">[153]</ref> were subsequently investigated with different steroids, these enzymes proving to have less strict stereochemical requirements.

In the following paragraphs we will discuss some examples that can be extrapolated from the patent and scientific literature. iodocyclization reaction performed on the chiral monoester 80, followed by displacement of the iodide in 81 with sodium triazolide. In turn, 80 is synthesized by enzymatic acylation of the symmetric diol 79 under nonaqueous conditions. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (Novozym 435) and vinyl acetate in acetonitrile, highly enantioselective acetylation of diol 79 occurs to give the monoacetate 80. Acetonitrile was selected as the reaction solvent since the subsequent iodocyclization step was carried out in the same solvent at 0 8C, simply by removing the enzyme beads by filtration and carrying out the cyclization on the crude enzymatic reaction mixture. This enzymatic process is continuously running in a pilot plant to supply material for the clinical trial. <ref type="bibr" target="#b280">[165]</ref> In another example from the Bristol ± Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Group, the resolution of racemic 84 by an acetylation reaction catalyzed by lipase PS-30 was scaled up to 640-L batches.

Chemoenzymatic synthesis of cathecols. ploited this biotransformation by coupling it with nonenzymatic transformations in a domino reaction sequence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b331">[204]</ref> As shown in Scheme 18, the ortho-quinones, obtained by action of a mushroom tyrosinase, subsequently underwent a Diels ± Alder reaction in the presence of different dienophiles. This three-step reaction cascade allowed the preparation of functionalized bicyclo [2,2,2]octene-diones in a rapid and efficient manner. The enzyme horseradish peroxidase catalyses the free radical polymerization of phenols in the presence of H 2 O 2 . The poor solubility of the growing polymer chains in water leads to the incorporation of organic solvents into the reaction medium; for example, polymers of para-phenylphenol were produced in aqueous dioxane and the molecular weight of the macromolecules increased with decreasing water content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b332">[205]</ref> . This methodology might offer a valid alternative for the preparation of phenolic resins avoiding the use of the toxic formaldehyde; the technology is under development, as shown by patent applications.</p><p xml:id="_jM2j4TQ">Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) was also used in organic solvents (such as isopropyl ether). Both the enzyme and the nicotinamide cofactor were deposited onto the surface of glass beads, which were then suspended in a water-immiscible organic solvent containing the substrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b333">[206]</ref> Due to the insolubility of the NAD(H) molecule in the organic media, the cofactor could only be regenerated in situ by using the ªone enzyme ± two substratesª approach. Using HLADH, the cofactor NADH could be regenerated by the oxidation of EtOH to acetaldehyde, while the oxidized NAD could be produced by the reduction of isobutyraldehyde.</p><p xml:id="_PwdXX29">A partially purified preparation of ()-a-pinene cyclase from sage (Salvia officinalis) was shown to convert geranyl pyrophosphate to the monoterpene olefins a-pinene, camphene, limonene, and myrcene in hexane. The cyclase was shown to be stabilized with respect to temperature and time by the use of a hydrocarbon solvent, and, in all other characteristics, to exhibit properties closely resembling those observed in aqueous media. <ref type="bibr">[44c]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5." xml:id="_6m2MruU">Summary and Outlook</head><p xml:id="_Kr4M4V7">The enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents, described as an unusual phenomenon in some pioneering papers published at the beginning of this century, has turned into an important instrument for organic synthesis in the last decade. As has been pointed out in the previous sections, hydrolases ± and particularly lipases ± are already a well-exploited tool for transformations performed up to a production-plant scale. Oxynitrilases, a class of enzymes which catalyses one of the most important reactions of organic chemistry, the formation of the carbon ± carbon bond, are also on the way to becoming an industrial success. Applications of these biocatalysts ranges from the preparation of milligrams of specifically labeled compounds to the modification of fats on a multiton scale and from the preparation of complex key intermediates for the pharmaceutical industry to the synthesis of polymers. Other enzymes, especially oxidoreductases, have found more limited applications. Additional research is needed to overcome such drawbacks as limited substrate and/or coenzyme solubility and enzyme instability or inhibition in organic solvents.</p><p xml:id="_VRExuPh">Besides the overwhelming reports on synthetic applications, enzymatic catalysis in organic solvents has stimulated basic research to address questions related to the performance of enzymes in nonnatural environments, as well as to their catalytic mechanism in such media. In the last few years particular attention has been paid to understanding why the catalytic activity of enzymes in anhydrous organic solvents is, in most cases, drastically diminished relative to that in water. As a result of this effort, different causes of this phenomenon have been elucidated, and the research is now focused on the design of strategies that might restore full enzymatic activity.</p><p xml:id="_emXza39">Finally, it has been pointed out that optimization of enzymatic performances can be obtained by manipulating the protein structure through genetic engineering, either by site-specific or by random mutagenesis. Enzyme engineering and ªmediumº engineering are supporting the exploitation of this methodology in a decisive way and expanding the synthetic potentiality even further.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="4,307.56,403.61,240.90,7.46;4,307.56,413.19,240.91,8.22;4,307.56,422.83,240.94,8.17;4,307.56,432.41,233.96,7.46;4,307.56,441.99,130.20,7.46;4,321.51,56.80,226.94,341.92"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc xml:id="_vHXKkDh">Figure 2.
