(b) The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses can be described quantitatively via rational models. There are several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. The concept that stabilization against one type of stress commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. (c) A host of developments of novel biocatalysts in the past few years, in part fueled by improved designability and improved methods of stabilization, has considerably broadened the toolbox for synthetic chemistry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_9NJx6uj">INTRODUCTION AND SCOPE</head><p xml:id="_DD3f9ja">This review describes the status of the fields of biocatalysts and enzymes, as well as existing drawbacks, and recent advances in the areas deemed to represent drawbacks. Here, biocatalysts are understood to comprise any protein of a length that allows three-dimensional folding, known from statistical mechanics to start at approximately 20 amino acids in length. Therefore, RNA catalysts, cofactor-only catalysts, and other organocatalysts are not covered by this review.</p><p xml:id="_vzFTXFT">The rapid spread of biocatalytic routes and targets in the past few years has been aided by advances in protein engineering as well as the increasing importance of both short, selective routes to pharmaceuticals and the synthesis of chemicals from renewables. Most of these syntheses are based on the processing of carbohydrates, lignocellulosics, and vegetable oils, rather than coal, oil, or natural gas. Several eminent reviews of the field have been published; as examples, the reader is referred to works by Turner (1), Bornscheuer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, and Reetz <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_8QDCMZr">OVERVIEW OF FIELD</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_dbXrU9b">Primer on Proteins</head><p xml:id="_aJQ3X3v">Proteins are a class of macromolecules consisting of one or more folded amino acid chains of overall three-dimensional structure. Proteins consist of one or more linear chains of, with rare exceptions, the common 20 proteinogenic amino acids. The fairly frequent disulfide bonds between cysteines are formed through crosslinking of side-chain interactions but do not constitute branching of the backbone chain. Extremely rarely, an additional genetically coded twenty-first amino acid is found, such as selenocysteine in formate dehydrogenase or glutathione peroxidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>, or pyrrolysine, the twenty-second amino acid, in methanogens (belonging to the domain of Archaea) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>. This review does not cover the body of excellent work performed to incorporate nonproteinogenic and often even unnatural amino acids into proteins [for reviews, see <ref type="bibr">Ngo &amp; Tirrell (8)</ref> and Xiao et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> ].</p><p xml:id="_4CBzAfj">Sequences. The sequence variety of proteins is large, 20 N possible combinations, but not infinite. Monomers of enzymes typically consist of 147 (bovine lysozyme) to 667 (alcohol oxidase from Aspergillus or Pichia) amino acid residues, most of them clustering between 280 and 400 residues. Protein sequences are searchable with a variety of algorithm-based tools, such as BLAST (<ref type="url" target="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ref>), ClustalW (<ref type="url" target="http://www.clustal.org">http://www.clustal.org</ref>), or FASTA (<ref type="url" target="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blastcgihelp.shtml</ref>), in a variety of databases, such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, <ref type="url" target="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ref>) maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), or ExPaSy (<ref type="url" target="http://www.expasy.org">http://www.expasy.org</ref>), maintained by the EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute, <ref type="url" target="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">http://www.ebi.ac.uk</ref>). Recent access to GenBank ( January 5, 2015) revealed 184,938,063,614 stored bases. Most sequences deposited in data banks hail from genome sequencing projects and are not actually functionally verified but annotated, i.e., computationally compared to sequences with known function and thus surmised to have the same function as the homologs.</p><p xml:id="_MFVPm9f">Structures. Despite the huge number of protein sequences, proteins only fold into comparatively few three-dimensional structures, approximately 1,300 folds (<ref type="url" target="http://www.proteinstructures">http://www.proteinstructures</ref>. com/Structure/Structure/protein-fold.html). Protein structures are deposited in databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) of the NIH (<ref type="url" target="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do</ref>). As of January 5, 2015, there were 105,499 structures deposited in the PDB, among them 34,987 distinct proteins and 7,454 nucleic acid-containing structures. With regard to the structures, The underlying mechanism assumes three possible elementary reaction steps: (a) formation of an enzyme-substrate complex (ES-complex), (b) dissociation of the ES-complex into E and S, and (c) irreversible reaction to product (P). In this scheme, the product formation step from ES to E + P is assumed to be rate-limiting, thus the ES-complex is modeled to react directly to the free enzyme and the product molecule, which is assumed to dissociate from the enzyme without the • Acceleration and efficiency. Enzymes have been found to accelerate uncatalyzed reactions very effectively: the most effective biocatalyst, orotate decarboxylase, accelerates the uncatalyzed background reaction 10 17 -fold, so the acceleration ratio k cat /k uncat is found to be ≤1.4•10 17 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. The proficiency of biocatalysts, the ratio k cat /(k uncat •K M ) ( = 1/K T ), covers the range of ≤10 23 M -1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Surprisingly, for a range of enzymatic reactions k cat is within two orders of magnitude, whereas k uncat varies by more than six orders of magnitude; the most effective enzymes were found to accelerate reaction with the slowest uncatalyzed reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_2NfY9jz">Strengths of Biocatalysis</head><p xml:id="_h88jZ4m">The foremost strength of biocatalysts is their often superb specificity: enzymes often far surpass other catalysts with respect to chemical specificity; regioselectivity, such as toluene monooxygenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, hydroxyaminobenzene (HAB) mutase <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, or cytochrome P450 BM-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>; or enantioselectivity, for which there are legions of examples, such as N-acyl amino acid hydrolase (acylase) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>, lipase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>, epoxide hydrolase <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, amino acid dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, or amine dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_UTXeMks">Biocatalysts commonly operate at nearly ambient conditions with respect to temperature and pH value in mostly aqueous solution. Operation at near ambient conditions promises energy efficiency of biocatalytic processes. Typical renewable raw materials, such as carbohydrates or fatty acids, are more hydrophilic than raw materials obtained from petrochemicals, which tend to be hydrocarbons. Such hydrophilic raw materials are advantageously processed in aqueous solvents, so biocatalysis is a good technological fit for renewable raw materials.</p></div>

This review focuses on three:</p><p xml:id="_DQxsqQM">1. The development of biocatalysts is prone to chance and slow, and does not follow a set of rules. The development of enzymes from nature and improvement through random mutagenesis are perceived this way. 2. A decisive weakness of biocatalysts is their very limited range of stability with respect to temperature, solvents, pH value, ionic strength, and salt type.</p><p xml:id="_GC7rd5E">3. A continuing weakness of biocatalysis as a problem solution is the small number of wellcharacterized enzymes in comparison with chemical catalysts. In addition, not many are commercially available and thus hinder the diffusion of this technology. Downloaded from <ref type="url" target="www.annualreviews.org">www.annualreviews.org</ref>.

Afterward, we discuss a few success stories of biocatalysts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_5sEwM9d">INSUFFICIENT DESIGNABILITY OF PROTEINS: PROGRESS IN PROTEIN ENGINEERING</head><p xml:id="_XBPvmnV">The arguably most important reason for the progress of biocatalysis over the past decade is the advance of protein engineering. Progress can be divided into three waves:</p><p xml:id="_rZ4v3a4">1. Rational protein design, the first wave, was developed a few years after the discovery of recombinant DNA technology and flourished in the decade after about 1985. Applying sitedirected protein engineering, the community expected to design enzymes with predictable properties (this expectation turned out to be way premature). Even then, site saturation was part of the repertoire, which intellectually can already be attributed to 2. combinatorial protein engineering, the second wave and often also called directed evolution, with its peak between around 1995-2005. Two techniques dominate combinatorial protein design, random mutagenesis and recombination. Random mutagenesis most often operates with a high error rate of DNA duplication and thus introduces mistakes that lead to mutations anywhere in the gene sequence. Recombination digests the DNA into small pieces that are recombined in random fashion; appropriately, its most important protocol is called DNA shuffling. Combinatorial protein engineering is able to access a vastly wider sequence space than rational design but requires increasingly large libraries of mutants, with still low and uncertain chances of a successful outcome, owing to the vast sequence space of proteins. Both the requirement for high-throughput screening equipment and the uncertain hit rates led the community to search for more controllable techniques and protocols, and so 3. data-driven protein engineering, the third wave of protein engineering, sought to improve the hit rate while decreasing library size. Data-driven protein engineering, often also termed semirational protein engineering, routinely utilizes knowledge gained from rational design, such as critical residues from mechanistic studies or inspection of crystal structures, and combinatorial design, such as hot spots found during directed evolution. But it is because of three tools developed over the past 10 years that protein engineering has advanced so much: (a) restricted libraries; (b) combinatorial active-site saturation testing, or CASTing; and (c) iterative site mutagenesis (ISM).</p><p xml:id="_hRHBEn2">a. Restricted libraries: The full genetic code operates at the DNA level with four nucleotides [the purines adenine (A) and guanine (G) and the pyrimidines cytosine (C) and thymine (T)] (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). As a triplet codes for an amino acid, there exist 4 3 = 64 triplet combinations of the nucleotides. Although some amino acids are only coded for by one triplet, such as ATG for methionine (Met, M) or TGG for tryptophan (Trp, W), most amino acids are coded for by several closely related triplets, such as TCN for serine (Ser, S) or CCN for proline (Pro, P) (here, N stands for any nucleotide: A, C, G, or T). Restricted libraries do not offer the full 64 triplet combinations, through restricting the number of nucleotides to fewer than four in one, two, or all three of the triplet positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. Although such a restriction very often leads to coding for fewer than the full 20 proteinogenic amino acids, the residues not coded for might not be deemed important for the problem at hand to be solved; if more space in a substrate binding pocket is desired, the inclusion of Trp, the largest of the proteinogenic amino acids, seems less important. However, the number of colonies at constant coverage (such as 95%) required to be screened for an outcome falls dramatically, which enables much faster and more reliable screening (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_qjgPegF">Downloaded from <ref type="url" target="www.annualreviews.org">www.annualreviews.org</ref>.

Combinatorial active-site saturation testing, or CASTing, restricts the number of amino acid residues targeted for mutation and then applies a random mutation or a saturation protocol across the targeted sites <ref type="bibr">(29a)</ref>. Deciding to which residues to restrict the targeting requires information from crystal structures, mechanistic knowledge, sequence matching, or results of prior experiments. Setting coverage at ≥95%, saturation screening of up to two amino acid residues is feasible with standard screening procedures and equipment. With restricted libraries, three and sometimes even four amino acid residues are accessible (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). c. In almost all cases, more promising amino acid residues are found in an enzyme than can be targeted at a single site in a single round of CASTing. ISM carries out successive CASTing across several sites in a protein (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>. Whereas different pathways, say ABCD versus BCDA, often result in intermittent variants with different strength of function, say ABC versus BCD, a variant incorporating a certain number of mutations has properties that are independent of the pathway traveled to arrive at that variant. ISM is very strong, however, at picking up synergistic coupled mutations, termed epistatic interactions.</p></div>

If, in addition, saturation kinetics can be assumed ([S] K M ), the TTN can be expressed as the ratio of the catalytic rate constant k cat scaled by the fraction of the remaining active enzyme from [N]/[N] 0 (k cat • [N]/[N] 0 = k cat,obs ) to the observed rate constant of deactivation k d,obs at the same temperature, pH value, ionic strength, and solution composition (35). Process-relevant biocatalyst activity. What is the most relevant criterion to gauge processrelevant activity of enzymes? Enzyme specificity k cat /K M , favored by biochemists, has been argued to be misleading at substrate concentrations [S] 0 &gt; K M , as is relevant for most industrial applications, where the substrate concentration is very high, often &gt;1 M (36). Instead, an efficiency function E f has been proposed, which scales the catalytic constant k cat to the product of the second-order rate constant of diffusion k diff [≈3.2•10 9 (M•s -1 ) in water at 25 • C] and a relevant concentration, here the term K M + [S] <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(37)</ref>. In expanded form to accommodate the case of reversible enzyme reactions, the equation for E f reads:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E f = k cat (1 + 1/K)/ k diff (K M + [S] + g(k cat,f /k cat,r )[S] , 5.</formula><p xml:id="_9yq4DB6">where K is the equilibrium constant; k cat,f and k cat,r are the rate constant for the forward and reverse reaction, respectively; and g = 1 for reversible and 0 for irreversible reactions. E f is useful for comparing different variants of the same enzyme on the same substrate at the same pH value and temperature.</p><p xml:id="_yFpWmDh">For applications in synthesis, the time to reach a certain, often very high, degree of conversion (such as 99%) is crucial. Several common measures of enzyme performance are all inadequate in that regard. Specificity, k cat /K M , does not capture conditions at substrate saturation, i.e., K M &gt;(&gt;) [S] 0 , conditions that are very common in synthesis, as high starting concentration [S] 0 allows to make more product in one batch. The catalytic constant k cat by itself does not take into account uncompetitive and noncompetitive product inhibitions, which both reduce the effective maximum rate constant. Both k cat /K M and k cat commonly do not take into account strongly varying substrate concentration during synthesis runs, so different degrees of conversion result in very different residence times.</p><p xml:id="_6xEBJHf">Recently, the average velocity v avg over the course of the reaction to a specified final degree of conversion, or catalytic effectiveness, has been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>.

Likewise, if the product inhibition constant K IC differs between two enzymes or two variants of the same enzyme, estimates of performance based on initial rate measurements cannot be extrapolated to higher degrees of conversions and thus not to the prediction of average velocity v avg or catalytic effectiveness.</p><p xml:id="_4ed2rCt">Downloaded from <ref type="url" target="www.annualreviews.org">www.annualreviews.org</ref>.

Quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical models of the transition state and the first shell of residues around the active site were required, respectively.</p><p xml:id="_Dr5cKmw">Kemp eliminase. The one-step proton abstraction reaction from 5-nitroisooxazole to pcyanonitrobenzene (Kemp elimination), in which proton abstraction results in irreversible N-O bond cleavage, does not feature any highly developed natural catalyst, so its uncatalyzed rate constant k uncat is extremely low. This catalytically straightforward reaction thus was a good test case for a novel method to develop biocatalysts, the design of an active enzyme by computation from scratch. With the aid of quantum mechanical models, transition states of the purported enzyme are created and then docked into a vast number of protein structures. The original computationally designed Kemp eliminase KE70 employed a familiar His-Asp dyad for proton abstraction but produced an enzyme with low specificity, with a k cat /K M value of around 100 (M•s) -1 , which is not synthetically useful. Protein engineering in the form of incorporating rationally designed mutations, as well as nine rounds of directed evolution featuring both random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling, resulted in a protein with a specificity of 5•10 4 (M•s) -1 , which corresponds to a rate acceleration k cat /k uncat of approximately 10 7 over background <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_CeeVBeu">KE07, another computationally designed Kemp eliminase, employed a glutamate, the catalytic base aiding proton abstraction, and an apolar binding site, which resulted in similarly low specificity as KE70. Seven rounds of evolution yielded 200-fold improvement to a k cat /K M value of 2.6•10 3 (M•s) -1 , i.e., a rate acceleration k cat /k uncat of approximately 10 6 , requiring eight mutations and resulting in decreased thermodynamic stability. The improvement of activity was attributed to modulation of the interaction of the catalytic glutamate with the substrate and the optimization of its pKa <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(93)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_5GhCpyW">A third eliminase, KE59, featured the highest specificity of all computational designs and catalyzed elimination of unactivated benzisoxazoles but could not be subjected to the standard protocol of directed evolution owing to its lack of stability. However, upon the inclusion of stabilizing consensus mutations, the acceleration improved to 10 7 and catalytic specificity improved more than 2,000-fold to 6•10 5 (M•s) -1 , mainly due to an improved k cat value <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(94)</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_bVJDJxZ">Another Kemp eliminase computationally designed on the basis of quantum mechanics and subject to extensive protein engineering achieved an acceleration ratio k cat /k uncat of 6•10 8 over background <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(95)</ref>. On the basis of a very high-resolution crystal structure (1.09 A ˚), the success of the best variants was attributed to the high degree of precision of the positioning of catalytically relevant groups, as well as to shape complementarity between substrate and binding site, the same elements that render naturally evolved biocatalysts successful.</p><p xml:id="_e4BuzAf">A recent review of de novo computational design of enzymes, while optimistic for the technique, stresses that protein engineering and structural studies are important for success; success is defined here as reaching catalytic activity, specificity, and acceleration on a par with naturally occurring enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(96)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ZvqXvMc">CONCLUSIONS</head><p xml:id="_3JKzAWZ">There is consensus in the community that biocatalysts are competitive or even superb in terms of activity and selectivity at near-ambient conditions. In the past, three points have often been raised to question the overall role of biocatalysis in catalytic processing: the lack of designability of biocatalysts, their limits of stability, and the insufficient number of well-characterized, readyto-use biocatalysts.</p><p xml:id="_mQMmgm5">Progress on all three fronts, outlined in the preceding section of this review, is very encouraging.</p><p xml:id="_jTAQt3E">1. Novel protein engineering tools have significantly enhanced the toolbox for biocatalyst development (see above for descriptions of experimental and computational tools). 2. The deactivation of biocatalysts under various stresses, far more so than other kinds of catalysts, can be described quantitatively via rational models. Although protein stabilization commonly occurs in an incremental fashion as a function of amino acid sequence, there are now several cases of spectacular leaps of stabilization after accumulating all stabilizing mutations found in earlier rounds. Last but not least, the concept that stabilization against one type of stress, often thermoinstability, commonly also stabilizes against other types of stress, such as organic solvents, air-water or solid-water interfaces, or cavitation as a consequence of pumping or ultrasonication, is now experimentally considerably better founded than a few years ago. 3. A host of developments of novel biocatalysts in the past few years, in part fueled by improved designability and improved methods of stabilization, has ended up considerably broadening the toolbox for synthetic chemistry. Considering that the focus of this review on novel biocatalysts had to leave out the vastly improved characterization of several more established biocatalysts, such as transaminases, aldolases, and even the most frequently used lab-scale biocatalyst, Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), the rate of progress of the field is truly encouraging. However, to claim victory, two additional aspects will have to fit into a Chemocatalytic the picture as well: suitable synthetic targets for and commercial availability of biocatalysts, not just on a lab scale but on a full production scale.</p></div>
