<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_x2KgvQK"><p xml:id="_N9XdUj7">The continuous flow synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, value-added chemicals, and materials has grown tremendously over the past ten years. This revolution in chemical manufacturing has resulted from innovations in both new methodology and technology. This field, however, has been predominantly focused on synthetic organic chemistry, and the use of biocatalysts in continuous flow systems is only now becoming popular. Although immobilized enzymes and whole cells in batch systems are common, their continuous flow counterparts have grown rapidly over the past two years. With continuous flow systems offering improved mixing, mass transfer, thermal control, pressurized processing, decreased variation, automation, process analytical technology, and in-line purification, the combination of biocatalysis and flow chemistry opens powerful new process windows. This Review explores continuous flow biocatalysts with emphasis on new technology, enzymes, whole cells, co-factor recycling, and immobilization methods for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, value-added chemicals, and materials.</p></div>

While manufacturing of bulk chemicals including hydrocarbons, fertilizers, synthetic fibers, paper, wastewater, steel, methane, and iron ore can be dated back to 1771, continuous flow manufacturing of fine chemicals is relatively new. In this respect, recent research has advanced continuous flow synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> value-added chemicals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> modern agrochemicals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and materials for hydrogen capture, storage, and electronics. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> The concept of flow chemistry is simple. A fluid containing starting material is pumped through a reactor in a continuous manner to yield a stream of product (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A pump (or series of pumps) injects the solution(s) into the reactor, and these can be grouped into semi-continuous and continuous pumps. Semi-continuous pumps (e.g., syringe pumps) require refilling the syringe, while continuous pumps do not require refilling, and can theoretically process solutions indefinitely (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_w8H7can">Continuous flow reactors are typically constructed from metals, glass, and plastic, with the most common material being PFA (perfluoroalkoxy) tubing. While plastic reactors are the most common, metal reactors can withstand higher temperatures and pressures, and can be constructed from catalytic metals such as copper. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> The types of continuous flow reactors include (i) reactor coils, (ii) micro or mesofluidic chips, (iii) packed bed reactors, (iv) cartridges containing immobilized reagents, or (v) tube-in-tube reactors for reactions involving gases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> Pumping solutions through continuous reactors allows rapid heating or cooling with temperature ranges being dependent on the reactor capabilities, typically À78 1C to +300 1C. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> Additionally, specific reactor tubing can be effectively irradiated with light to accelerate photo-catalyzed reactions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and solid precipitation can be handled by sonicating reactor coils or other methods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> Finally, semi-permeable Teflon AF-2400 tubing allows gases such as CO 2 , H 2 , N 2 , and O 2 to diffuse through the reactor tubing; the approach is useful for reactions requiring slow diffusion of gases in or out of solution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> The final piece of a basic continuous flow system is the backpressure regulator that pressurizes the system (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). If a backpressure regulator has an internal pressure of 200 psig, then the fluid in the continuous flow system must achieve a pressure of 200 psig to exit the backpressure regulator. The backpressure regulator has several advantages. First, solvents can be heated above their atmospheric boiling points without evaporation, opening novel process windows. Second, even if the continuous flow system is operating at atmospheric temperature, the backpressure regulator ensures even fluid flow through the reactor (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Furthermore, several backpressure regulators are now available, including regulators that can be tuned to the exact pressure required.</p><p xml:id="_UggjsDX">Continuous flow systems have the potential to improve a large number of chemical processes (B50%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> The first research area to capture the interest of flow chemistry was API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) synthesis. For example, the continuous flow synthesis, purification, and formulation of several APIs was achieved in a manually reconfigurable system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> More recently, scientists at Pfizer demonstrated continuous automated screening of 41500 Suzuki reaction conditions per day. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> While these systems are complex, expensive, and require significant expertise, the examples highlight potential solutions to real world problems. However, in reality, most researchers have access to only several pumps, basic reactors, and maybe a backpressure regulator and separator. This limitation, however, is not due to reluctance for technology adoption, but the high price of equipment (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_nvszQcx">The rapid growth and adoption of continuous flow synthesis was driven by the arrival of commercially available technology, methodology, and industrial interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> Likewise, continuous flow biocatalysis is currently undergoing its own revolution, generating a number of publications over the past three years including an general overview of the area (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> There has also been an increase in continuous flow knowledge in both academia and industry that did not previously exist; it is now common for researchers to have continuous flow experience, and thus it has expanded into new laboratories.</p><p xml:id="_QAjR8wA">Before exploring continuous flow biocatalysis, an understanding of the differences between whole cell and purified protein biocatalysis is required. Whole cell catalysis uses the whole organism such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) for the transformation, while purified protein biocatalysis uses an extracted protein without the cell present. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> It should also be noted that the field of continuous flow biocatalysis builds on seminal work from the laboratories of Stan Roberts, Alexander Klibanov, George Whitesides, Bryan Jones, and their co-workers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> In whole cell biocatalysis, unless the protein is excreted from the organism, or displayed on the surface of the organism, <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref> the substrate must enter into the cell for it to be transformed, and the product must also exit the organism after the reaction. Two branches of whole cell catalysis exist -fermentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> and biocatalysis. This Review focuses on biocatalysis only. The advantages of whole cell biocatalysis include (a) it's less expensive than using purified proteins, (b) the reaction doesn't need to be supplemented with expensive co-factors, which are contained within the cell, and (c) the reaction is performed in its native environment avoiding problems associated with in vitro biocatalysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> The disadvantages of whole cell biocatalysis include (a) the cell membrane limits penetration of the substrate and product making the reaction slower compared to purified protein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> (b) the cell can have undesirable metabolic pathways creating toxic byproducts or unwanted chemicals, (c) the process is more complicated, so research &amp; development can take longer, and (d) from a process standpoint, the reaction chamber is fouled from cellular debris and residual product, and this can </p></div>

For detailed examples, additional Reviews exist. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> Purified protein is typically obtained via bacterial expression in E. coli (but can also include yeast or mammalian cell lines). <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> In this process, <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref> a host cell (such as BL21 DE3 E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> ) is transformed with a plasmid encoding the gene for the required protein. When the cells are grown, the protein of interest is expressed using native cellular machinery. After protein expression, cells are exposed to high-energy sonication to break open the cells and release the protein into solution. After centrifugation of the solution, the protein, if correctly folded, resides in the supernatant. The protein can then be purified through chromatography or precipitation.</p><p xml:id="_ebQTsSN">Purified enzymes have the advantage of being incredibly specific. This property reduces byproduct formation, but also makes enzymes typically quite specific for substrates. Notably, lipases, are used ubiquitously in biocatalysis, and are promiscuous in their substrate preferences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> Additionally, the substrate is only required to diffuse into the active site of the protein, and not through the cell membrane. Finally, the concentration of the desired enzyme is higher compared to the same mass of whole cells. Purified proteins also have several disadvantages, including (a) the purification process can be expensive, (b) sometimes overexpressed proteins are not correctly folded, (c) proteins often require cellular environments or additional co-factors for high activity, and finally (d) proteins can be unstable outside of the cell.</p><p xml:id="_Jpfcn5C">Though enzymes are used in continuous systems without immobilization, attaching proteins to solid supports offers advantages. Most importantly, some enzymes are only available in small quantities; attaching the enzyme to the reactor decreases quantities required for processing. Additionally, enzyme immobilization simplifies product purification, through retention of the enzyme. Enzymes have also shown increased stability, selectivity, and improved reaction rates after immobilization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> Many immobilization techniques exist, and have been reviewed previously. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref> In general, immobilization supports should offer the following properties: large surface area, sufficient functional groups for attachment, hydrophilic character, water insolubility, chemical The first continuous flow system would be used for a synthetic transformation using two pumps to mix fluids before entering the reactor. The fluid then passes through the reactor before exiting through a backpressure regulator into the collection flask. The variables indicated in the scheme should be quoted (flow rate, reactor volume, internal diameter of the reactor tubing, and reactor temperature) in manuscripts. The second system is a simple continuous flow biocatalysis experiment. Here, a substrate solution is pumped through a packed bed reactor housing immobilized enzymes. The solution passes through the reactor to be modified before exiting into a collection flask. The third system is an advanced experimental set-up. Here, an organic solvent (such as ethyl acetate) is pumped through the packed bed reactor with the substrate solution. The organic phase dissolves the product to accelerate the enzymatic reaction, and a UV detector that can provide information back to the pumps monitors the out flow. Additionally, an in-line separator is used to separate the aqueous layer from the organic. In theory, this approach can provide a pure stream of product in the organic layer. (C) Both semi-continuous and continuous pumps are shown. The benefits and disadvantages are described. The high price of continuous flow pumps often limits the construction of larger continuous flow systems. and thermal stability, mechanical strength, high rigidity, resistance to microbial degradation, and ease of regeneration. Ideally, resins will also be non-toxic, and have a low price. <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95</ref> In reality, many immobilization supports have several of these qualities, but not all.</p></div>

For example, during recombinant protein expression a polyhistidine affinity tag (His n -tag) is often encoded at a protein terminus. This His n -tag allows protein purification on nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin, as the His n -tag has an affinity for the resin under fairly neutral buffer conditions (pH 8.0). The protein of interest will complex to the Ni-NTA resin allowing selective protein removal from bulk solution. Once the protein of interest is isolated, adding 250 mM imidazole, or lowering the pH of the solution, will leach the protein from the resin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">124,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">125</ref> Affinity immobilization supports can be categorized into two groups. First, the matrix is pre-coupled to an affinity ligand (such as the NTA ligand mentioned above), or second, the enzyme is pre-bound to an affinity ligand that gets incorporated into a matrix. Examples of affinity supports include chitosan-coated porous silica beads <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">126</ref> and agarose-linked with concanavalin protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">127</ref> </p></div>

Under optimal conditions, a feed of 6% (v : v) acrylonitrile was pumped into the first reactor at 1.1 mL min À1 before meeting a second stream of pure acrylamide at 35 mL min À1 (to ensure 6% (v : v) acrylonitrile was present at all times, Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">135</ref> Using a system comprised of two packed beds, the space-time yield increased almost two-fold to 93.2 g (L h) À1 .

The E. coli entrapped into calcium-alginate gel were found to be thermally stable at 75 1C, and were used in a glass packed bed reactor. Maltodextrin trehalosylmaltotetraose was produced at 106.5 mg mL À1 h À1 when using a 30% (w/v) solution of maltohexaose substrate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>).

This raises an important concern in continuous flow biocatalysis: is a larger quantity of immobilized cells with lower activity preferred, or vice versa? In this case, only 24% of cells were immobilized into calciumalginate beads, but 100% activity was retained. In contrast, the polyacrylamide support retained 81% of the cells, but after o5 h of processing, activity was reduced to B20%. In our opinion, a smaller quantity of highly active immobilized material allows increased performance compared to a reactor containing the same mass.</p><p xml:id="_J4vfNn3">Continuous flow whole cell biocatalysis has been used for the asymmetric reduction of cyclohexanone analogs using super critical CO 2 . <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">137</ref> Here, Geotrichum candidum cells were immobilized onto water-absorbing polymer beads (BL-100) and the substrate added semi-continuously.

The authors also demonstrated the enantioselective reduction of o-fluoroacetophenone (499.9%) using the same system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>).

Milk is flowed through this reactor at 45 1C. This continuous system had lower hydrolysis rates than a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). However, this is not surprising as the residence time in the CSTR was greater (600 min vs. 125 min); notably, CSTRs can also handle solid precipitation, and are commonly used in API synthesis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[139]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">[140]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">[141]</ref> A residence time of 125 min in the continuous flow system yielded B40% lactose hydrolysis while the CSTR yielded near quantitative hydrolysis in 600 min. Additionally, the CSTR demonstrated accelerated reactivity compared to the continuous flow system. Finally, the stability of the whole cells was best when stored in milk at 4 1C; no decrease in activity was observed over seven weeks of storage. This contrasts with many storage methods requiring B50% glycerol at decreased temperatures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">138</ref> The synthesis of enantiopure (5R)-hydroxyhexane-2-one was achieved with immobilized Lactobacillus kefiri. <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">142</ref> In this continuous system, whole cells were immobilized with sodium cellulose sulfate at 40% efficiency, and although the immobilization reduced activity, switching from batch to continuous flow (0.8 h residence time) improved performance by an average of 19-fold.

Interestingly, the water generated from the esterification (8.0 mg min À1 ) was not a problem in this system; the water capacity of the co-solvent isooctane (8.5 mg min À1 at 42 1C) was sufficient. This method of co-solvent water absorption would benefit system scale up, but could the esterification be enhanced with active water removal?</p><p xml:id="_Wggv3ku">Novozyme 435 (lipase B from Candida antartica) is a common lipase due to its commercial availability and advanced properties. This lipase is immobilized onto a hydrophobic acrylic resin that gives the lipase stability in a wide range of physiological conditions such as operating between 20-110 1C, good recyclability up to 5-10 times, and activity of 10 000 PLU g À1 . Additionally, this immobilized enzyme can be purchased from many commercial suppliers (B$13 per g). In 2008, Novozyme 435 was used for the synthesis of alkyl esters in a continuous flow packed-bed system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">19</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157</ref> Here, a 0.2 M solution of 1 : 1 acid/alcohol in hexane was flowed through a packed bed of Novozyme 435 (B100 mg, 23 1C) at 1 mL min À1 to yield alkyl esters at close to 100% conversion over two hours. Over 7.5 h, a steady 97% conversion yield was achieved to demonstrate good lifetime and stability. A batch vs. flow comparison found that the continuous flow system rapidly accelerated ester formation compared to the batch reaction; this example again provides evidence for the benefits of continuous flow. Notably, it is vital to always compare batch vs. continuous flow experiments.</p><p xml:id="_QTtcvZJ">Novozyme 435 has also been used for the oxidation of alkenes under continuous flow conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">158</ref> Here, a packed bed reactor performed chemoenzymatic oxidation of alkenes in high purity and yield. For this transformation, peracetic acid (a peroxy substrate) was used as a cost effective oxygen donor (B$5 per mL). In this reaction, the peracetic acid transforms the alkene into the epoxide, and the lipase regenerates the peracetic acid from the resulting acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref>). This system performed the oxidation of five substrates in excellent yields (97-99%). The importance of testing reaction mixture solubility prior to continuous flow experiments is emphasized in this work. In this reaction set up, the substrate solution was loaded into a gas tight syringe and passed through the packed bed reactor. If the solubility of the substrate solution changes over time, then the solution is not at a steady state, which will adversely affect system performance. Before performing reactions in continuous flow, examining the solubility of solutions, either qualitatively or quantitatively can save a lot of time. Finally, notice the correct use of a backpressure regulator in this system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref>). The system was tested at temperatures up to 70 1C; without  Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref> Continuous flow epoxidation using Novozyme 435 in a packed bed reactor with hydrogen peroxide as the initial oxygen source. <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">158</ref> the backpressure regulator maintaining 100 psig, uncontrollable flow rates and substrate vaporization would have resulted.</p><p xml:id="_A9mJUpD">An interesting application of Novozyme 435 was the ring opening polymerization of e-caprolactone to polycaprolactone in a microfluidic device (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">21</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">159</ref> Here, microfluidic channels are filled with the immobilized lipase, and the substrate is pumped through the channels. As expected, faster polymerization and higher molecular mass of product polymer was observed compared to the same reaction in batch. Typically, during propagation the reaction mixture becomes increasingly viscous with higher molecular mass, limiting the diffusion of the growing polymer. This problem was overcome in continuous flow allowing higher mass polymers to be formed; presumably micromixing and increased surface area drove this beneficial quality. Finally, the degree of enzyme leaching was lower in continuous flow compared to the same experiment in batch (o1% leaching).</p><p xml:id="_n9qk7Cb">A chemoenzymatic synthesis of chiral enantiopure 2-(1Himidazol-yl)cycloalkanols requiring ring opening followed by a chiral resolution with Novozyme 435 was achieved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">22</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">160</ref> While ring opening under continuous conditions afforded the same conversion as the microwave-assisted variant, chiral resolution in continuous flow was superior compared to the batch reaction. For this substrate, Novozyme 435 acylated the (R,R)-trans product, and left the (S,S)-trans product unaltered. Continuous flow resolution provided easy product separation, enzyme recycling, reduced system downtime, and increased productivity of the biocatalytic step, as instant enzyme/ substrate ratios can be achieved.

The benefit of this system is that cartridges full of immobilized catalyst (bio and metals) can be connected to the system for immediate testing.

First, Novozyme 435 is readily available, promiscuous, thermally stable, and demonstrates limited enzyme leaching over long time periods. These properties contrast with expressing a specialty protein in-house, which is typically an expensive and time consuming process. Second, immobilized lipases can handle toxic and unusual chemicals. Here, lipases handled HCN and ionic liquids; such capabilities will surely open novel process windows. Third, many continuous flow examples showed improved yields compared to batch reactions. This important feature is due to increased surface area of the catalyst, micromixing, removal of product concentrations from the protein active site to drive the reaction and avoid product inhibition, and finally the system can decrease distances required for substrate diffusion.</p></div>

This system operates as a recycling packed bed reactor where the solution is passed back through the reactor during the reaction. The system was operationally stable for 250 h at 20 mL min À1 , producing sorbitol at 5.20 g (L h) À1 . Interestingly, this system had a pH titrator using 5 M NaOH solution for maintaining pH 6.0 during reaction recycling.

As a result, the reaction in continuous flow generated higher yields compared to the batch reaction. Notably, this example illustrates in-line monitoring.

In particular, horseradish peroxidase was immobilized on micro-and nano-lithographic gold surfaces to oxidize phenol into polymers. Here, the gold provided a surface to either physically adsorb horseradish peroxidase, or to form a horseradish peroxidase monolayer. This simple microfluidic system converted 35% of phenol in solution, as well as several other phenol-like motifs in 4-7% conversion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">31</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b169">170</ref> Although low conversions were observed, this research created a useful method to immobilize enzymes into a specific pattern that could be used for multistep reactions.</p><p xml:id="_mP5b8tB">Acid phosphatase was immobilized onto polymethacrylate beads through an epoxy-based attachment for alcohol phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">32</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b170">171</ref> Here, the immobilized enzyme was placed into a packed bed reactor and alcohols flowed through with inorganic phosphate. The reactor showed good stability for 12 days at a flow rate of 30 mL min À1 and produced 32 g of material (78% isolated yield). However, the fed batch reactor also showed similar conversion. Compared to current chemical methods of alcohol phosphorylation, this offers an inexpensive route for producing multi-gram quantities of material. Since the fed batch reactor gave the same conversion, the reaction was likely not diffusion-limited, or the residence time was not short enough to see a difference in reaction rates. Although conversion was the same in the fed batch process and continuous flow processes, sampling a shorter timescale may reveal a different trend; it is possible for continuous flow reactors to reach equilibrium in shorter times.</p><p xml:id="_wQGXnHY">A fed-batch reactor allows substrates to be delivered in low concentrations to avoid substrate inhibition and protein denaturation. Until 2013, this was not possible in continuous flow systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">172</ref> However, Szita et al., developed a multi-input reactor for transketolase biosynthesis. Here, a solution of wildtype transketolase forms a new C-C bond between lithium hydroxypyruvate and glycoaldehyde to yield (L)-erythrulose at 15 mg h À1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">33</ref>).

This is a particular exciting advancement as many enzymes suffer from substrate inhibition at the high concentrations preferred for industrial applications.</p><p xml:id="_W5krng9">Tube-in-tube reactors allow gas diffusion in-and-out of liquid reactions contained within a reactor. The reactor set up is simple; one gas permeable tube lies within another, non-permeable tube. To demonstrate how this reactor can benefit continuous flow biocatalysis, the hydroxylation of 2-hydroxybiphenyl to 3-phenylcatechol was explored (Fig. <ref type="figure">34</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b172">173</ref> Here, a biphasic reaction mixture is passed through a reactor comprised of Teflon AF-2400 tubing where O 2 can diffuse in, and CO 2 out. The Teflon AF-2400 tubing is contained within larger diameter tubing that is significantly less permeable to gases (PFA tubing for example). In this reaction, 2-hydroxybiphenyl-3monooxygenase, sodium formate, NAD + , formate dehydrogenase (to recycle the NAD + ), and Tween 20 (for increased enzyme stability) are contained in the aqueous phase, and 2-hydroxybiphenyl in n-decanol. During the reaction, the substrate diffuses from the organic phase into the aqueous phase, along with O 2 . Once the enzymatic reaction is complete, the product diffuses back into the organic phase, and the CO 2 byproduct diffuses out through the Teflon AF-2400 tubing, helping maintain the correct pH. Using this set-up, the product was achieved at 17.7 g (L h) <ref type="bibr">À1</ref> .</p><p xml:id="_Xkz6kP3">Many natural products contain optically pure amines.

As a proof of concept, E. coli overexpressing o-transaminase were immobilized onto methacrylate polymer resin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">174</ref> The cells used isopropylamine (IsoPA) as the amine donor for transforming non-natural ketones into their respective amines. Using two streams, one containing IsoPA, and the other the ketone, the solutions were fed into a packed bed reactor housing immobilized cells for a residence time of 30-60 min at 20-50 1C. Under a backpressure of 75 psi (and with methyl tert butyl ether as the solvent), enatiopure amines were synthesized in high ee (499%). Additionally, the system was stable for five days of processing, and provides a good example of whole cell use. Although the co-factor PLP is expensive, it was created in situ for immediate use. Furthermore, to isolate the amine product, the continuous stream was passed through a silica cartridge to 'catch' the product. After the reaction completion, the silica was rinsed with methanol to 'release' the product -'known as a catch and release method' (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">35</ref>).</p><p xml:id="_dy4VMXn">Multi-step (or cascade) biocatalysis is becoming popular as improved attachment methodology emerges. While many enzyme immobilization methods exist, Niemeyer and co-workers used a streptavidin affinity peptide on the biocatalyst to bind with high affinity to streptavidin immobilized on magnetic beads.

Controlling which enzymes the substrate is exposed (and in which order) allowed control over which product is formed.

While a whole section below is dedicated to co-factor regeneration, one example uses a system where co-factor and enzyme are co-immobilized to yield a self-sufficient system.

For example, aminating cinnamaldhyde required two-minutes in continuous flow and afforded 90% conversion; the equivalent reaction required 24 h in batch. Also, aminating vanillin took two minutes in continuous flow and yielded an 18% conversion; the same conversion took 24 h in batch. Typically improved productivity in continuous flow is often reported, all authors should always ask the following questions: is comparing long reaction times in batch to a rapid continuous flow reaction always examined under appropriate conditions? For an accurate comparison, reactions in batch should be ideally tested on the same time scale as the reaction being examined in continuous flow. Additionally, initial rates of reaction are more interesting in continuous flow due to increased mass transfer and shorter diffusion distances.</p><p xml:id="_SBhFU6c">The same style of continuous system was also used to transform amines to aldehydes, operating the enzyme in reverse with pyruvate as the amine acceptor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_20">40</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">178</ref> Here, 16 amines were converted in 3-15 min residence times; conversions between 90-99% were observed. The comparison to a batch process was also made, and the authors concluded the continuous flow system offers rate acceleration. Interestingly, they found that aldehydes became immobilized in the packed bed reactor.

Unlike most continuous flow biocatalytic systems, the enzymes were not immobilized, but were recovered through in-line filtration devices. This style of processing has several benefits including (a) avoiding enzyme activity loss upon immobilization, (b) larger, more sensitive proteins could be amenable to recycling instead of immobilization, and (c) providing a known concentration of biocatalyst could aid process reproducibility; in contrast, immobilized enzymes can decrease in concentration over time, which could be problematic.</p><p xml:id="_854E4WX">Captopril is a widely used API used in the treatment of antihypertension.

The Coflore ACR is a dynamically mixed plug flow reactor that uses moving agitators to promote mixing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">47B</ref>), while the Coflore ATR is a tubeshaped reactor using lateral movement (like twisting a spring in a horizontal direction) for improved mass transfer in two-phase reactions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">47C</ref>). Given that oxygen is required for this biocatalytic process, it was an ideal system to test the effects of scaling on reactor performance. As expected, increasing the batch reactor size from 250 mL to 4 L decreased the reaction rate; four hours were required to reach B50% conversion in a 250 mL reactor vs. 25 h in a 4 L reactor. Additionally, both continuous flow reactors improved the reaction rates due to improved mass transfer; in the ACR, B75% conversion was achieved in two hours compared to only B50%. For the 1 L ATR continuous flow reactor, five hours afforded 65% conversion compared to B22% in a 1 L batch reactor. This example illustrates the benefits of continuous flow systems for biocatalysis compared to batch, while also demonstrating the correct way to achieve an accurate comparison. In this work, the authors track the conversion at equal times for both the batch and continuous flow reactions, and also use the same volume reactor for the comparison.</p><p xml:id="_GQDVUE3">Next, processing parameters of a segmented flow microreactor were examined to yield a high performing system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">185</ref> Unlike most examples, many parameters were examined such as (a) which biocatalytic transformations benefit from continuous flow, (b) optimal ratios of aqueous and organic solvents, (c) reactor tubing diameter, and (d) flow velocity. This research examined a wide range of considerations that are often overlooked. First, only biocataltyic reactions with a high mass transfer co-efficient will likely benefit from segmented flow biocatalysis. Thus, a reaction limited by substrate or product diffusion could be improved by continuous flow. Second, reducing heptaldehyde to heptanol using thermophilic alcohol dehydrogenase was optimal in smaller diameter tubing. This is due to an increase in mass transfer and flow velocity. An increase in flow velocity (increasing the flow rate through the same reactor length) improved the transformation until the flow became too powerful and denatured the enzyme. Although this observation seems counter intuitive, increasing flow velocity improves mixing; thus, this parameter could allow the same conversion at higher flow rates and decreased residency times. For example, a residence time of 10 min (1.86 cm s À1 ) afforded high space-time yields, while increasing the residence time to 20 or 30 min (0.91 cm s À1 and 0.61 cm s À1 respectively) decreased space-time yields.

In this enzymatic system, lower substrate concentrations were transformed more effectively in smaller diameter tubing, and vice versa. To aid this finding, a reactor with three different reactortubing diameters was constructed. The initial reaction with a high substrate concentration of 300 mM was mediated in 2.15 mm diameter tubing for improved reactivity. As the substrate concentration decreased, the reaction mixture was flowed into smaller diameter reactor tubing (1.0 and 0.5 mm) to improve reaction rates at lower concentrations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">48</ref>). This reactor design could be highly useful for many reactions that are both substrate-and product-inhibited.</p><p xml:id="_wCjD9Ah">Nidetzky et al., reported an immobilization approach for an 87 mL volume microfluidic reactor using silica nanosprings as the support (Fig. <ref type="figure">49</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">186</ref> Here, sucrose phosphorylase is expressed with a silica-binding domain (SBD, known as Z basic2 ) for rapid immobilization onto the silica nanosprings. Without the SBD, 87% of protein is lost in the immobilization process, making it inefficient. Simply fusing a SBD onto the N-terminus of the protein allows rapid immobilization in two hours by filling the microfluidic cell with an enzyme solution. Using silica nanosprings with a high surface area of B300 m 2 g À1 allowed a 4.5-fold average increase in activity. Additionally, further modifying the nanosprings with sulfonate groups increased this improvement to 10-fold. This solution could inspire new microstructure-supported biocatalysts. For mesoscale continuous flow reactors, it would be beneficial to create a packed bed from these materials and see the benefit of such an immobilization strategy at higher flow rates.</p><p xml:id="_agzCTfn">3D printing has been used in continuous flow synthesis to create customizable reactors known as 'reactionware'.

For this process, three enzymes were immobilized onto surface of the carbon nanotube reactor to facilitate electron transfer between the hydrogenase and NAD + reductase.

Chemicals typically move in a mono-directional flow with limited reverse diffusion back down the reactor. Thus, once a sacrificial reductant such as a hydride transfer reagent is used, it can only be regenerated via interaction with chemicals in that individual flow segment or the surface of the continuous flow reactor. In contrast, sacrificial reductants or hydride transfer reagents in batch reactors can be regenerated easily as there is multi-directional diffusion. This next section examines current state-of-the-art continuous flow co-factor regeneration methods.</p><p xml:id="_dFkAfMt">Co-factors are low molecular weight organic or inorganic compounds required for enzyme function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">52</ref>). Metal co-factors include iron, magnesium, and zinc, which can play both structural and catalytic roles. The most popular co-factor examined in this Review is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which can exist either in an oxidized or reduced state, NAD + and NADH respectively. Enzymes use co-factors as reagents and co-catalysts during complex chemical transformations. For example, NADH can provide a hydride source during bioreduction. The versatile co-factor PLP plays roles in diverse reactions involving amino acids including transamination, decarboxylation, deamination, and racemization. Co-factors are often essential for biocatalytic activity, and their requirements must always be considered.</p><p xml:id="_HsbCSXB">Co-factors require regeneration for multiple rounds of biocatalysis. For example, NAD + , must be re-oxidized after conversion to the NADH to yield a catalytic system. Additionally, co-factors are expensive for industrial processes (NADH = $260 g À1 ). Thus, for biocatalysis to be economically attractive, co-factors should be regenerated. Furthermore, co-factor regeneration can drive reactions to completion, simplify product isolation, and prevent by-product formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">189</ref> However, co-factor recycling is a hurdle to enzyme implementation at industrial scales.</p><p xml:id="_vrjbRaR">Extensive research has produced new chemical, enzymatic and electrochemical methods for the regeneration of co-factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">[190]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">[191]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b191">[192]</ref> The regeneration method must match several specifications.

For the system to be catalytic, NADH must be oxidized back to NAD + . This oxidation was achieved using graphite as an electrode with a low voltage of 0.35 V versus SCE, and NADH concentration was determined by absorbance at 340 nm. Optimal conditions provided NADH oxidation with 499.95% yields.</p><p xml:id="_aRxEAut">Next, NADH was regenerated in a microfluidic set-up using multi-stream laminar flow (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_31">54</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b197">198</ref> Here, NAD + results from using NADH in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. To regenerate the required NADH, the molecule FADH 2 acts as a hydrogen donor to afford FAD and NADH. However, the FAD then also needs to  be regenerated. For this to occur, an electron is transported from the cathode to formate dehydrogenase, which then regenerates FADH 2 . Under multi-stream laminar flow conditions, reactants close to the electrode promote reversal of the unfavourable reaction equilibrium present in co-factor regeneration. The authors first test the regeneration efficacy using only NAD + , FAD and formate dehydrogenase; a regeneration efficiency of 31% was achieved. This methodology was then extended to converting a chiral pyruvate into chiral (L)-lactate with a yield of 41%.</p><p xml:id="_JcjXK5k">A major challenge for scaling electrochemical regeneration is limited diffusion, which can impair the rate of electroenzymatic reactions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ZDDFt89">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_DA5c8qA">Continuous flow biocatalysis is a powerful tool in chemical synthesis. Although continuous flow organic synthesis has enjoyed significant popularity, continuous flow biocatalysis is not far behind. What started as an industrial area focused on bulk chemical generation has grown into a thriving R&amp;D arena for fine chemical generation. Many examples detail the range of enhancements continuous flow can bring to enzyme-mediated transformations. These include improved reaction rates, in-line product removal and purification, better mixing, improved control, use of process analytical technology, and improved enzyme stability and lifetime. It is remarkable that improved performances of up to 351-fold were observed in continuous flow, and that is without any directed evolution of the enzyme; it is worth considering the improvements possible by combining directed evolution and continuous flow.  Fig. 64 Continuous resolution of racemic N-Boc-phenylalanine ethyl thioester using cartridges filed with immobilized acylase and grafted silica gel. 223   <ref type="bibr" target="#b224">225</ref> Upon reflection, there are areas that need to be improved. First, immobilization efficiencies are often low, and once immobilized, many enzymes lose considerable activity. For continuous flow biocatalysis to become even more beneficial, general solutions to improve immobilization and residual activity are required. Second, comparisons between batch and continuous flow need to be carefully monitored. The reaction in batch should be performed under conditions that closely emulate the contrasting continuous flow conditions. Here, enzyme loading, concentration, temperature, pressure and time should be kept constant, otherwise comparisons are hard to believe. Third, continuous flow conditions need to be reported accurately so that systems can be transferred from lab-to-lab without additional optimization. Finally, continuous flow process lifetime is not always explored. For continuous flow biocatalysis to be considered on industrial routes, the process lifetime and efficiency needs to be explored. If authors are trying to demonstrate the benefit of the enzyme-driven process over the chemical, it's a compelling case if the enzyme-driven system lasts for weeks, not minutes. As more enzymes become commercially available, the push towards greener and more cost effective biotransformation's will increase, and continuous flow biocatalysis will likely to rapidly expand and diversify over the next few years.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0" coords="2,42.52,100.00,249.40,6.84;2,42.52,110.00,172.56,6.82"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc xml:id="_xHrH3C8">Fig. 1 Reactors used for continuous flow synthesis and biocatalysis.

The organic phase dissolves the product to accelerate the enzymatic reaction, and a UV detector that can provide information back to the pumps monitors the out flow. Additionally, an in-line separator is used to separate the aqueous layer from the organic. In theory, this approach can provide a pure stream of product in the organic layer. (C) Both semi-continuous and continuous pumps are shown. The benefits and disadvantages are described. The high price of continuous flow pumps often limits the construction of larger continuous flow systems.</figDesc><graphic coords="3,93.20,49.83,408.91,307.67" type="bitmap" /></figure>
