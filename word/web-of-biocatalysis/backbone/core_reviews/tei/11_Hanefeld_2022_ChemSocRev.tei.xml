<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_QtHGuSE"><p xml:id="_Hzwb5tG">Biocatalysis has an enormous impact on chemical synthesis. The waves in which biocatalysis has developed, and in doing so changed our perception of what organic chemistry is, were reviewed 20 and 10 years ago. Here we review the consequences of these waves of development. Nowadays, hydrolases are widely used on an industrial scale for the benign synthesis of commodity and bulk chemicals and are fully developed. In addition, further enzyme classes are gaining ever increasing interest. Particularly, enzymes catalysing selective C-C-bond formation reactions and enzymes catalysing selective oxidation and reduction reactions are solving long-standing synthetic challenges in organic chemistry. Combined efforts from molecular biology, systems biology, organic chemistry and chemical engineering will establish a whole new toolbox for chemistry. Recent developments are critically reviewed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_j8yEZkV">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_WzFEVz5">In 1837 Liebig and Wo ¨hler described the action of an enzyme: the crude preparation of hydroxynitrile lyase from the almond Prunus amygdalus (PaHNL), which they called emulsin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> This emulsin released HCN from a compound also isolated from these almonds, later identified as (R)-mandelonitrile. At that time Berzelius had just coined the term catalysis based on, among others, Do ¨bereiner's experiments with platinum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> Liebig and Wo ¨hler then went on to disprove that special forces (vis vitalis) were necessary to prepare organic compounds and chemistry was set to continue as a single field of science. But when Fischer published his lock and key hypothesis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> chemistry was already split into several fields: in 1907 Buchner received the Nobel prize in Chemistry for his work on cell free application of enzymes for fermentation. But the first enantioselective organic synthesis, the enantioselective addition of HCN to benzaldehyde by Rosenthaler, reverting Liebig and Wo ¨hler degradation of (R)-mandelonitrile, was published in 1908 in a biochemistry journal (Scheme 1a). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Today this is considered the first wave of biocatalysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> It did not, however, move enzymes centre-stage of Chemistry. This lack of interest in the possibility of enzymes for selective and in particular enantioselective synthesis became even more visible with the Nobel prize of 1931: the discovery by Warburg of redox enzymes, all of which are highly enantioselective, was the prize for Physiology or Medicine not for Chemistry. Equally the first industrial enantioselective synthesis, the preparation of (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) for L-ephedrine production catalysed by yeast whole cells dates back to that time and finds little to no recognition in chemistry textbooks (Scheme 1b). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> With the recognition of the need for selectivity in general and enantioselectivity in particular also came the recognition of enzymes as promising catalysts. The difference in perspective on selectivity is, however, still visible in the approach that the fields of catalysis take to describing their catalysts: while in most fields a catalyst that is broadly applicable, i.e. not very selective, is called versatile, in biocatalysis an enzyme that lacks selectivity is called promiscuous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> This difference in terminology between the different fields of catalysis can lead to undesirable confusion. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> 1.1 Enzymes: back to chemistry? Two landmark reviews from 2003 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> dispelled myths around biocatalysis and identified three waves in biocatalysis. The first wave started with the enantioselective synthesis of (R)-mandelonitrile and continued via L-ephedrine synthesis towards the formation of selected drugs, such as penicillins all the way to the bulk production of fructose from glucose for the food production. All these processes rely on identifying suitable, naturally occurring enzymes without protein modifications. In all cases use was made of the excellent, if not occasionally too high, selectivity. The vast majority of these developments took place outside main stream chemistry, often in biochemical, food or pharmaceutical laboratories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> 1.1.1 Deviating from selectivityenzyme engineering. A first step to address the problem of too high selectivity was the application of enzymes evolved for degradation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> The vast majority of hydrolases, be it lipase, esterase, protease or glycolase evolved not for one single substrate as anabolic enzymes did. These enzymes consequently typically have a relaxed substrate scope and might even be not specific for one single functional group but rather show activity towards several groups. This is often seen for lipases, esterases and enzymes that hydrolyse amide bonds. The predominant part of these enzyme have one core structure, the a,b hydrolase fold, and make use of a core catalytic mechanism based on the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad with variations to address the necessities of the substrate in question.</p><p xml:id="_Bge9jfa">This was followed by a second and third wave of biocatalysis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> In the second wave either well-thought through mutations were introduced or random mutagenesis coupled with massive screening yielded new enzymes that could answer the industrial needs. This included the required selectivity. The third wave combined the two approaches of enzyme improvement, reducing library sizes and allowing rapid screening. As a consequence, the adjustment of the properties of a given enzyme has become almost a standard laboratory technique. Broadening or narrowing the substrate scope, improving or inverting the regio-or enantioselectivity but also adjusting the optimal reaction conditions of enzymes are state-ofthe-art nowadays. Furthermore, the reaction scope of biocatalysis is increasingly extended either by designing new biocatalysts or combinations of enzymes enabling transformations not thought possible a few years ago. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> As a consequence, the scope of biocatalytic bond formations today almost matches the scope of existing chemical technologies (Scheme 2).</p><p xml:id="_nbwEaBd">The results of this third wave now spreads to all fields of biocatalysis and is the focus of this review.</p><p xml:id="_RtJPJh9">1.1.2 Stabilityenzyme engineering and immobilisation? A perceived disadvantage of enzymes is their stability. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Enzymes cannot withstand reaction temperatures significantly above 100 1C. But the question is, do they have to? Chemists are used to applying elevated temperatures to accelerate reactions. The Haber-Bosch process, for example, necessitates reaction temperatures of 400 1C and above to overcome kinetic hurdles in the reduction of the dinitrogen triple bond. At high temperatures, however, the thermodynamic equilibrium of this reaction is unfavourable therefore necessitating high pressures to shift the equilibrium. Biological pendants achieve this at ambient temperatures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Chemists accept that transition metal catalysts are often air and water sensitive. They would not survive a single washing cycling in a washing machine. But modern washing powder contains enzymes that help to clean our clothes under mild conditions, reducing energy consumption (low washing temperatures) and reduce the application of soaps. Enzymes, just like any other catalyst type, bear advantages and disadvantages. It is thus irrational to come up with general statements about a general type of catalysts. Instead, one should look at them case by case, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> to allow a judicious choice of the catalyst that suits the desired reaction best.</p><p xml:id="_Urr7p4T">For example, enzymes involved in primary metabolism under natural conditions (intracellular environment) do not encounter high substrate or product loadings, nor are they typically confronted with drastic changes of conditions. All of this does however, occur in a batch reaction, in particular when working solvent-free. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Here the second and third wave of biocatalysis help. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> The engineering of structural aspects helps to improve stability, in particular towards solvents <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and high concentrations of all reagents, substrates and products. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> An alternative method of enzyme stabilisation, their immobilisation, has been investigated with similar success and has been reviewed extensively. It is therefore not covered in this overview. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> 1.1.3 Low substrate loadingsenzyme engineering and alternative solvents? A second challenge closely linked to stability is the substrate loading. If water is employed concentrations of hydrophobic substrates are often low. Addition of a solvent to improve solubility, two phase systems and neat substrate may all induce stability problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Some enzymes could always be employed under typically chemical conditions, i.e. dry solvents, high temperature and very high substrate loads. As already exemplified in the 2003 review <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> and in extensio by Klibanov in 2001, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> they could always be working just like any chemical reagent. The prime example for this ability is Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), but this also applies to many other enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> The stability problems of the remaining enzymes can be addressed by immobilisation or Scheme 2 Synthetic transformations listed on <ref type="url" target="https://www.organic-chemistry.org/synthesis/">https://www.organic-chemistry.org/synthesis/</ref>. Green boxes indicate that a biocatalytic equivalent is known; orange indicates that literature reports are available but that the reaction has not yet been applied synthetically. Red indicates a (so far) unknown biocatalytic bond formation.</p><p xml:id="_bqkJbe2">in particular the third wave of biocatalysis: enzyme engineering. Directed enzyme engineering has led to a huge extension of the number of stable and versatile enzymes. Here we examine the chemistry that has become possible with this third wave, demonstrating how it has flushed biocatalysis and enzymes right into the centre of chemistry again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2." xml:id="_Sp36txg">Chemical transformations catalysed by biocatalysts</head><p xml:id="_ssThvVz">Based on the above written the reader might now expect that for the vast majority of chemical conversions a biocatalytic variant is available. This biocatalytic process should then have ideally several advantages over its uncatalysed chemical counterpart. While this status is not yet reached we here demonstrate the many waves that biocatalysis is by now making in organic synthesis. In many cases the biocatalytic methods complement the already available tools, enriching chemistry. We follow the sequence of the waves, C-C bond forming enzymes appeared early (Wo ¨hler, Liebig, Rosenthaler), <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> subsequently redox enzymes (Warburg) were intensely studied at a later stage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> We combine this sequence with the disconnection approach common in organic chemistry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1" xml:id="_k3WytE8">C-C-Bond forming reactions</head><p xml:id="_XETzMzk">The formation of C-C bonds is essential for any organic synthesis to establish the carbon framework of the desired compound. This is in particular the case in total synthesis of natural compounds and pharmaceutical chemistry. Here the superior selectivity of enzymes is the basis of many successes. However, this selectivity to date also limits the broad application of enzymes, as there is no single enzyme that catalyses Friedel-Crafts chemistry in general, as AlCl 3 does. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> Up to the present time the largest part of the enzyme catalysed C-C bond formations are based on the nucleophilic attack on an aldehyde. This yields 1,2 disconnections in the case of cyanide or the umpolung of a second aldehyde or 1,3 disconnections when an enol(ate) is used as nucleophile. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> The aldehyde can be replaced by a ketone, though then the reactions often have lower yields as the reaction equilibria are less favourable. Essentially six nucleophiles (in biochemistry called donor) are today broadly utilised in combination with countless aldehydes or ketones (in biochemistry called acceptor) (Scheme 3). Additionally the aldehyde based biocatalytic equivalent of a Pictet-Spengler reaction is already well-known. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> 2.1.1 1,2 Disconnection. This disconnection is part of the first wave of biocatalysis and the possibilities thereof were improved and expanded with each new wave (Scheme 1). The oldest biocatalytic reaction, the attack of cyanide yields chiral 1,2 difunctional cyanohydrins in the case of the HNLs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref> These enzymes do not require supplementation of the reactions with cofactor. For the second nucleophile, an aldehyde of almost entirely free choice, an umpolung is essential to ensure its attack on the first aldehyde (or ketone). This is enabled by thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), the cofactor required in this disconnection. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Both reactions suffer from an unselective background reaction that can compete with the enzyme catalysed reaction. In the HNL case this can be suppressed by lowering the pH to avoid the chemical, racemic reaction. For the ThDP-dependent enzymes it is the cofactor on its own that is already catalytically active. It should therefore not be utilised in a huge excess but carefully dosed.</p><p xml:id="_nXXFPHu">2.1.1.1 HNL-Catalysed reactions. HNLs catalyse in nature the decomposition of cyanohydrins to release HCN as a defence mechanism. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> This catalytic activity is a prime example of convergent evolution. It evolved in many very different organisms, plants and animals utilising very different protein folds and thus catalytic mechanisms. Consequently a wealth of enzymes, both R-and S-selective is available.

All umpolungs chemistry in nature is based on ThDP as a cofactor. In its unphosphorylated form it is known as vitamin B 1 and chronic lack of it causes the disease beriberi. The protein structure of the apoenzyme that then together with the ThDP forms the holoenzyme imparts both activity and selectivity to the ThDP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Given its unusual chemistry ThDP will be briefly described here (Scheme 5).

Both R-and S-cyanohydrins synthesis is straightforward <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> and (C) equally the enantioselective Henry reaction can be performed. Scheme 5 (A) Vitamin B 1 in its phosphorylated form as ThDP is folded in the enzyme so that the two aromatic rings are at close to 901 to each other. The amino group can then deprotonate the thiazole ring. (B) The resulting ylide then attacks either an aldehyde or an a-ketoacid. This results in either case in the carbanion that as donor attacks another carbonyl compound. The new C-C bond is formed and the product released. In all cases the reaction is fully reversible and kinetically controlled.</p><p xml:id="_2q3aNr7">folded such that the pyrimidine and the thiazolium rings have an angle of 90 degree to each other. The amino group of the aminopyrimidine ring is thus in close proximity of the hydrogen of the C2 of the thiazolium ring and can abstract it. This deprotonation is supported by amino acids from the protein scaffold. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> The resulting ylide can also be viewed as tautomeric carbene. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> The ylide is then ideally posed to attack a carbonyl compound, the electrophile or acceptor. This acceptor can be either an aldehyde (ketones are very rare due to the steric hindrance) or an a-ketoacid. In the case of the aldehyde the initially formed adduct undergoes the umpolung; the negative charge now resides on the carbon of the aldehyde carbonyl group. In the case of decarboxylases a-ketoacids are decarboxylated, again resulting in the umpolung of the carbonyl group. This reactive intermediate can be drawn in two tautomeric forms, the enamine and the carbanion. It attacks the second carbonyl compound, again in most cases an aldehyde as ketones are sterically very demanding. Subsequent to the formation of the new C-C bond the ThDP is again split off and the product is released. The reaction can equally well proceed in reverse. In the case of transketolase this reverse reaction is the natural reaction it catalyses.</p><p xml:id="_xSYMYBg">For a long time it was assumed that the forward reaction could be made irreversible by utilising a-ketoacids for the umpolung reaction. The release of gaseous CO 2 was considered to thermodynamically make the revers reaction impossible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66</ref> However, recently it has been demonstrated that this is a kinetic effect and that in both cases, with a-ketoacids and with aldehydes as donor molecule, the reaction is reversible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> All ThDP-dependent enzymes are arrangements of proteins around the ThDP, typically with two ThDP cofactors between homodimeric proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> It is these proteins that determine which molecule reacts with the ThDP, undergoes the umpolung and then acts as donor. This selectivity is typically high and often only relatively small molecules are accepted in the donor pocket. The second pocket enables the docking of the acceptor aldehyde and at the same time determines its orientation. This fixes the stereochemical outcome of the reaction. Elegant analysis of these binding pockets allowed the engineering thereof. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> As a result excellent control of the donor and acceptor molecule as well as the stereoselectivity was gained (Scheme 6).

The aldol reaction is the reaction of two aldehydes or ketones with acidic a-hydrogen that react with each other to a hydroxyl carbonyl or the unsaturated carbonyl (aldol condensation). It requires a large extent of control, (a) which carbonyl compound is the donor, which the acceptor, (b) how to suppress the elimination of water and (c) how to control the stereochemistry of the new Scheme 6 Based on the understanding of substrate docking in the active side both the donor pocket and the acceptor pocket can be modulated to accept the desired molecule. In this manner a toolbox of enzymes for all possible combinations could be established. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> stereocentre(s). Enzymes solve many of these problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> As aldolases are commonly employed in water its elimination is readily suppressed. Additionally they are very specific as to which molecule they can activate as donor (Scheme 3). The control of the stereochemistry raises a more general question. When only one stereocentre is established and the potential products are enantiomers the process is purely kinetically controlled and the selectivity of the enzyme determines the outcome of the reaction. When two or more stereocentres are established the outcome can be determined by kinetics if the difference in activation energies is large, or by thermodynamics, if the difference of the activation energies for the different stereoisomers is small. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82</ref> In that case the thermodynamic stability of the stereoisomers determines the final outcome of the reaction. This phenomenon has in particular been observed for glycine dependent aldolases <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> but has recently been shown to be a general fact, concerning all aldolases. Indeed, it applies to all catalytic reactions during which two or more stereocentres are generated, independent of whether they are biocatalytic or not. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> The aldolases are grouped by the nucleophile they activate into four groups (Scheme 3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> Overall three mechanisms are utilized. The acetaldehyde dependent aldolases utilises the enamine mechanism also known as class I and it is in its essence identical to the enamine chemistry in the organic chemistry textbook. A lysine reacts with the donor and then activates it as enamine which attacks the acceptor aldehyde. For the pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) dependent aldolases nature evolved two very different mechanisms. In higher plants and animals class I aldolases (enamine mechanism) are found. Class II aldolases are found in fungi and bacteria; here the mechanism is based on the Lewis acid activation of the donor and deprotonation thereof. For the glycine dependent aldolases a cofactor is required, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). In its reduced, unphosphorylated form it is also known as vitamin B 6 , lack of which causes skin disorders.</p><p xml:id="_hheqPGS">2.1.2.1. Acetaldehyde-dependent aldolases. The only enzyme known to utilise acetaldehyde as donor is 2-deoxy-D-ribose-5phosphate aldolase (DERA). <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> It catalyses the reversible aldol reaction yielding 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (DR5P) from acetaldehyde and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). DR5P is stable, as it forms a hemiacetal, shifting the equilibrium to the aldol side. This hemiacetal formation is an element of reaction engineering that is utilised regularly in DERA-catalysed reactions and in aldolase-catalysed reaction in general. <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88</ref> As the DERA-catalysed reaction is common in nature the number of DERA's is almost unlimited. The application of DERA struggles with one problem. The sensitivity of most DERA's to high acetaldehyde concentrations as acetaldehyde and in particular the side product of acetaldehyde self-condensation, crotonaldehyde, deactivate the enzyme. <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89</ref> This has been addressed via screening and enzyme engineering while at the same time expanding the substrate scope. <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> Although this improved the enzyme stability, additional reaction engineering, i.e. slow dosing of the acetaldehyde remains necessary.

Recently this has been coupled to an ADH-catalysed oxidation yielding the desired lactone (Scheme 7). <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100</ref> A more elaborate industrial cascade involving DERA is discussed below.</p></div>

For the syn-stereoisomer as well as for one of the anti-products the DHAP dependent aldolases are highly stereoselective. However, for the anti-product with the stereochemistry of tagatose, the corresponding tagatose 1,6-diphosphate aldolase (TDP A), displays low diastereoselectivity (Scheme 10). This is possibly due to a thermodynamically controlled product distribution in this case (see also Scheme 8B) as the observed lack of selectivity is diastereoselectivity and not enantioselectivity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> While this lack of selectivity is typically considered a disadvantage, it recently has been utilised to prepare rare sugars such as L-psicose and L-sorbose. 122   The DHAP aldolases are a versatile tool for the synthesis of sugars and sugar derivatives but their application is hampered by the low stability and high price of DHAP. To solve this problem two very different approaches were taken. In a classical approach a cascade of enzyme reactions was developed to generate DHAP in situ, starting from readily available glycerol.

MsAcT displays a very high preference of the formation of esters from activated acids and alcohols, in particular primary ones (Scheme 30). In contrast, lipases and esterases hydrolyse the activated acid straightaway. This special property of MsAcT opens up new possibilities. Remarkably not just ethyl acetate can be utilised as activated acid but a range of vinyl esters can be used, too.

This leads to product formation, in the case of penicillin acylase the amide bond, in the case of MsAcT an ester.

It was shown that MsAcT also works well for the synthesis of esters and amides in water or in biphasic mixture of water and acyl donor in flow, and this chemistry was broadly explored (Scheme 31). <ref type="bibr" target="#b297">[298]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b298">[299]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b299">[300]</ref> A single mutation of the nucleophile in the catalytic triad of MsAcT revealed even more possibilities for the application of this intriguing enzyme. By changing the catalytic triade from the standard Ser-His-Asp to Cys-His-Asp the hydroxy group of serine was replaced by the thiol of cysteine. This enabled the synthesis of thioesters, up to then essentially impossible with hydrolases. A wide range of thiol and thiophenol can now be converted. Particularly intriguing was that even CoA could be converted to acetyl-CoA. This was possible although the reaction times were long. However, the Ser11Cys MsAcT did not hydrolyse the product, allowing these long reaction times. The enzyme in this case utilised a different tunnel to the active side, allowing the large substrate to enter. With the Ser11Cys mutant it was also possible to convert amines into amides. Particularly interesting is the conversion of secondary amines to tertiary amides. This challenge had earlier not been met (Scheme 32). Thus, by a single mutation two major challenges for Green Chemistry have been solved, the straightforward and clean syntheses of thioesters and tertiary amides. <ref type="bibr" target="#b300">301</ref> An alternative methodology to synthesise amides in aqueous media has recently been introduced by Flitsch and coworkers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b301">302</ref> Based on a careful analysis of the catalytic mechanism of carboxylic acid reductases (CARs, vide infra) the authors hypothesised that CARs, next to the ATP-and NADPH-driven reduction of carboxylic acids, should also be able to catalyse the amidation of enzyme-bound and ATP-activated carboxylic acids (Scheme 33). A broad range of carboxylic acids and amine nucleophiles could be converted in high yields using this creative exploitation of mechanistic understanding! 2.3.1.2. Hydrolysis of PET. The application of esterases, lipases and amidases in polymer chemistry was for a long time focussed on the synthesis of polymers. The hydrolysis of polyesters or polyamides was much less investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> This is actually surprising as the hydrolysis of esters and amides in water should be straightforward. However, the hydrophobic surface properties and the low accessibility of the functional groups of the polymers essentially prevented this. While it is highly important that polymers are not biodegraded when they are applied in building materials and electrical appliances the ever increasing amount of plastic waste does need to be degraded. Indeed, plastics that are intended for short term usage should be designed in a biodegradable manner. Here splitting into the starting materials for recycling as truly new plastic would be of particular interest. This should in particular be possible for plastics with a hydrolysable ester or amide group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b302">303</ref> A major step toward polymer degradation and recycling was made when a Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) degrading bacterium was identified. <ref type="bibr" target="#b303">304</ref> This, together with earlier work on polymer degrading enzymes, gave a new boost to recycling of PET to the monomers. The natural answer to the difficult accessibility of the functional groups of the polymer was to evolve a swallow active site open along the surface. This type of active site already existed in cutinases, enzymes that hydrolyse waxes on leaves. Both the naturally evolved PETase and enzymes that were evolved in the laboratory proved interesting starting points for PET recycling. Very recently an enzyme was reported that was successfully evolved for this purpose. This mutated cutinase is highly suitable for the rapid hydrolysis of amorphous PET at relatively high temperatures (72 1C). It is important that the PET is amorphous in structure as crystalline PET is much more difficult to hydrolyse. At these relatively high temperatures the cutinase mutant rapidly hydrolyses postconsumer waste PET to approx. 90%, releasing terephthalic acid (Scheme 34). The high rate of hydrolysis is essential as PET otherwise crystallises under the reaction conditions. The obtained terephthalic acid was utilised to again prepare virgin PET of the same quality as before. While this does introduce two additional steps into the recycling it also means that always Scheme 31 MsAcT catalyses the formation of esters and amides in water.</p><p xml:id="_sjqsHeG">pristine polymer is (re-)generated. If the polymer is recycled as such the quality quickly degrades and down-cycling rather than re-cycling takes place. <ref type="bibr" target="#b304">305,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b305">306</ref> 2.3.1.3. Cyanide-free nitrile synthesis. The selective hydrolysis of nitriles to amides or acids is well-established industrial practice. The enzymes utilised for this, nitrilases and nitrile hydratases cannot be used in reverse. However, more recently a new type of enzyme was described that can convert aldoximes into nitriles. These aldoxime dehydratases (Oxd) contain a heme iron centre to which the aldoxime coordinates with its nitrogen atom. Subsequent elimination of the hydroxy group, induced by the catalytic cascade of Arg His Ser and enabled by the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(IV) is followed by the release of carbonyl hydrogen as proton with simultaneous reduction of the Fe back to Fe(II) and release of the nitrile from the active site. <ref type="bibr" target="#b306">307,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b307">308</ref> The Oxd can be employed in whole cells with the separately prepared aldoxime or the aldoxime can be generated in situ and then directly converted to the desired nitrile (Scheme 35). Oxd have been demonstrated to be enantioselective and they distinguish between E and Z aldoximes. Their application for the preparation of dinitriles, relevant for the polymer industry, has been demonstrated. Whole cell preparations have successfully been utilised in flow, demonstrating the versatility of these enzymes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b307">[308]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b308">[309]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b309">[310]</ref> 2.3.2 Oxidation reactions 2.3.2.1 Alcohol oxidation to aldehydes.
