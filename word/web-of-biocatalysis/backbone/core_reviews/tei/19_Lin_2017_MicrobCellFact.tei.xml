<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_Dtt5UDK"><p xml:id="_E7s7fhd">Whole-cell biocatalysts provide unique advantages and have been widely used for the efficient biosynthesis of valueadded fine and bulk chemicals, as well as pharmaceutically active ingredients. What is more, advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering, together with the rapid development of molecular genetic tools, have brought about a renaissance of whole-cell biocatalysis. These rapid advancements mean that whole-cell biocatalysts can increasingly be rationally designed. Genes of heterologous enzymes or synthetic pathways are increasingly being introduced into microbial hosts, and depending on the complexity of the synthetic pathway or the target products, they can enable the production of value-added chemicals from cheap feedstock. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology efforts aimed at optimizing the existing microbial cell factories concentrate on improving heterologous pathway flux, precursor supply, and cofactor balance, as well as other aspects of cellular metabolism, to enhance the efficiency of biocatalysts. In the present review, we take a critical look at recent developments in whole-cell biocatalysis, with an emphasis on strategies applied to designing and optimizing the organisms that are increasingly modified for efficient production of chemicals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_JFHaVxS">Background</head><p xml:id="_cawT333">Developing sustainable bio-based processes for production of fuels, chemicals, and materials is increasingly attractive due to increased concern for the environment. Chemical synthesis processes are generally high-yield, however they are often environmentally unfriendly and are associated with the production of unwanted byproducts, thus reducing efficiency and increasing downstream costs. In comparison with chemical catalysis, whole-cell biocatalysis offer some unique advantages (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) and provides an efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical synthesis for production of bulk and fine chemicals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. In the past several decades, many biocatalytic processes have been implemented to produce a wide variety of products in various industries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. The most important advantage of a biocatalyst is its high selectivity. The high selectivity, including regio-, chemo-, diastereo-and enantioselectivity, is very desirable in chemical synthesis and produces benefits such as reduced (or zero) use of protecting groups, minimized side reactions, easier separation of products, and fewer environmental problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Other advantages such as multi-step reactions in single strain with cofactor regeneration; high catalytic efficiency and mild conditions are also very attractive in commercial applications. In some cases, such as the asymmetric synthesis of chiral target compounds or the synthesis of some sophisticated chemicals, generating the desired products by traditional chemical means is challenging, and biotransformations can be the solution to these challenges. In addition, according to the FDA and European legislation, products obtained by biotechnological methods can also be considered natural, if the substrate for the process is of natural origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The label of natural is important for the profitability of bioprocess produced products. For example, 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) obtained by chemical synthesis from benzene or styrene is of a price about US$5/kg. However, natural 2-PE is about US$ 1000/kg <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. By far, 20.4-26.5 g/L 2-PE (space-time yields of 0.3 g/L/h) can be achieved in bioprocess <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. The yield of bioprocess may be not as high as chemical synthesis (yield &gt;98%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The label of "natural" and difference in price of a natural compound and its chemically synthesized counterpart can be considerable. Therefore, whole-cell bioprocess holds promise to be the commercially viable route to produce compounds that used in food, beverages, and cosmetics field. The most common drawbacks of biocatalysts include the presence of substrate or product inhibition, the presence of metabolic by-products, and the membrane acting as a mass transport barrier. A biocatalyst can be tailored with protein engineering and metabolic engineering methods to cope with these constraints. Nonetheless, conventional chemical synthesis still remains the staple of the chemical and pharmaceutical industries by far. The most important reason for industry to not shift to bio-based production of chemicals is its higher production cost. A multi-pronged approach to constructing efficient wholecell biocatalysts and improved production processes would be required.</p><p xml:id="_C7ZKmyM">Whole-cell catalysis approaches can broadly be classified into biotransformation (biocatalysis) and fermentation bioprocesses. In fermentations, the products are synthesized from growth substrates via the host cells' native metabolism and are accompanied in the fermentation broth by metabolic intermediates that make downstream processing complicated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. In biotransformations, cell growth (the enzyme manufacturing phase) and production phase are separated. Substrates are converted to the desired products by resting cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The key advantages of whole-cell biocatalysis are its abilities to use cheap and abundant raw materials and to catalyse multistep reactions. Gehring et al. reported the synthesis of rhamnolipids from the cheap raw material butane using a tailored whole-cell biocatalyst. The AlkBGT system from Pseudomonas putida (for butane activation) and the RhlABC system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (for rhamnolipid assembly) were integrated into the cell strain to result in rhamnolipid biosynthesis that used butane as the sole carbon and energy source. This approach represents a one-pot convergent total synthesis with more than 25 steps <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Whole-cell biocatalysts that include active enzymes or pathways make the time-consuming and material-intensive enzyme purification process more efficient. In addition to this upstream simplification, downstream processing can also be simplified, further decreasing environmental and economic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In an economic evaluation of a process, the cost of the product is considered. The cost of a product (US$/kg) = A + B/Yield + C/Pv, where A is the capital cost, B is the raw material cost and C is the operating cost. Here, Pv is the volumetric productivity in the unit of g/L/h. Cheap raw materials, efficient bioconversion, and the ability to reuse the biocatalyst many times reduce the cost of product and make whole-cell biocatalysis very cost-competitive with fermentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_8vMnsMg">Efficient whole-cell biocatalysts are very important for an economically feasible biocatalysis process with optimal titre, yield and productivity. The principles for designing whole-cell biocatalysts for bioconversions are quite different from those for designing the microbial cell factories that are used in fermentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Single or multiple enzymes, depending on the complexity of the synthetic pathway that produces the target products from the feedstock, need to be introduced into host cells to construct whole-cell biocatalysts for the production of value-added chemicals. It is important to consider whole cells, in their entirety, as catalysts and not only focus on the individual active enzymes to fully exploit the synthetic potential of microbial biocatalysts. Maximizing the flux through a synthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in obtaining the best volumetric productivity of a bioconversion, which thus lowers the production cost of the targeted chemicals. The emerging tools of synthetic biology, integrated with comprehensive omics data, facilitate metabolic engineering of microbial cells at an unprecedented level, holding promise for the development of a balanced, stable, productive, and efficient whole-cell workhorse platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_5HyRPps">Escherichia coli is perhaps the most widely used microbial platform for cell factories.

The catalytic efficiency of such processes is low due to high mass transfer resistance, and the processes are generally too complex for use on an industrial scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Assembling the synthetic pathways in a single strain reduces the mass transfer problem by avoiding the transfer of intermediates and thus greatly simplifies the operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. Whole-cell biocatalysis using engineered E. coli seems to be the most promising method and offers the potential for largescale and low-cost production. Consequently, this review focuses on whole-cell biocatalysis using microbial cell factories based on E. coli. Biocatalysis using a single strain as the sole catalytic unit can offer a broad scope of substrates that is not limited to natural pathways and thus opens the door to versatile multistep biocatalysis. Additionally, whole-cell biocatalysts can be rationally designed and readily tailored to their specific applications. In this review, we summarize the different strategies and efforts that have been used in designing and optimizing various whole-cell biocatalysts to convert cheap feedstocks to value-added chemicals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_mF42CWf">Efficiency</head><p xml:id="_mMcnGHY">Whole-cell biocatalysts allow for the facile implementation of enzymatic cascades that span multiple reactions, with an integrated supply of the myriad cofactors that are needed for such complex biotransformations <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. This internal supply greatly simplifies cofactor regeneration and makes the addition of expensive external cofactors unnecessary. Furthermore, the presence and protective nature of the cellular envelope helps stabilize the enzymes and can enable enzyme applications under harsh reaction conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. Moreover, the close proximity of reactants and catalysts, as well as the inherent presence of what would otherwise be expensive external cofactors, greatly improves biocatalyst efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_sUYqRS2">Catalyst cost</head><p xml:id="_3yEvkzS">As with any catalytic process, the cost and stability of the catalyst are highly relevant to its economical application in chemical manufacturing <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The use of whole cells circumvents the need for cell lysis and enzyme purification that is associated with biocatalysis with isolated enzymes and inherently greatly reduces the catalyst cost. No external cofactors are needed because the expensive cofactors can be supplied and regenerated by the cell, which also reduces the cost. Whole-cell biocatalysts are generally more readily prepared, the cost of fermentation is usually not prohibitive, and furthermore, the cells can often be used repeatedly <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Therefore, whole-cell biocatalysts have outstanding inherent cost advantages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_uPNJYaN">Downstream processing</head><p xml:id="_YnGVvkY">Typical biotransformation processes comprise two stages: growth of the living "catalyst" and conversion of the substrate(s). After cells are cultured, they are harvested and washed with water or a buffer solution and suspended in the desired buffer for biocatalysis. When the cells are washed, unconsumed growth substrates and nutrients, as well as undesired metabolites that were produced during growth, are removed from the system, allowing significantly better product recovery rates and greatly simplifying downstream processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Furthermore, the removal of necessary nutrients arrests cell growth, and resting cells can produce higher yields from their carbon source since the available carbon and energy is overwhelmingly used for product synthesis instead of biomass production <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_6bgzDDu">Whole-cell biocatalyst design principles</head><p xml:id="_HtDmk7M">The construction of effective whole-cell biocatalysts requires that single or multiple enzymes are introduced into host cells to construct synthetic pathways for the conversion of the desired feedstocks into the targeted products. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology efforts aim to enable rational design and construction of biosynthetic pathways that maximize the pathway flux to products by providing preoptimized chassis cells that enhance the production of target compounds. The strategies that are employed in the design and optimization of whole-cell biocatalysts are discussed below (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3vUSqUA">Design and construction of the biosynthetic pathways</head><p xml:id="_qazUNj9">Many new genes and pathways have been discovered with the recent advances in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. The numerous potentially valuable enzymes and pathways that are present in nature are being identified at an increasing pace <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, and these enzymes and pathways may represent the most valuable resource for reconstructing synthetic pathways to produce specific molecules; their importance emphasizes the industrial and commercial need for continued funding for basic science. The identified pathways can be transferred to microbial hosts such as E. coli to generate heterologous biosynthesis pathways for the production of exogenous and non-natural molecules. Heterologous expression of genes from the designed pathway in E. coli can be controlled independent of the host's regulatory network <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, resulting in easy control of the product-forming pathway. Here, we describe the basic design principles recently used to construct single-and multistep biosynthesis pathways, including de novo biosynthetic pathways, of various chemicals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_XnTr9TH">Single-step pathways</head><p xml:id="_J5TdTZw">Although whole-cell biocatalysis is primarily an alternative for in vitro multienzyme cascades, a number of successful and commercially viable whole-cell biocatalysts that use single-step reactions to produce fine chemicals exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. For whole-cell biocatalysis via single-step "pathways", recombinant plasmid-based expression of the enzyme results in high expression levels (overexpression) and thus make large amounts of the recombinant enzyme available. Whole-cell biocatalysis for one-step synthesis is especially preferred to catalysis by the isolated enzyme when the enzyme is unstable in vitro or requires expensive co-substrates or cofactors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. In these cases, enzymes should be screened for high activity, efficient heterologous expression, and a method of blocking the catabolism of the substrate and product, if present in the host cells, as they are the most important issues to be considered.</p><p xml:id="_jCEadqy">A whole-cell catalyst that expressed a novel esterase (EstK1) in E. coli produced cinnamyl acetate as a result of its high transesterification activity. The conversion ratio of cinnamyl alcohol reached 94.1% at 1 h and was even higher (97.1%) at 2 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. For whole-cell biocatalysis of l-carnosine production, two enzymes (DmpA from Ochrobactrum anthropi and BapA from Sphingosinicella xenopeptidilytica 3-2W4) were screened. High yields of l-carnosine (up to 71%) were obtained by optimizing relevant reaction conditions for the best-performing recombinant strain (E. coli DmpA syn ). The biocatalyst had a high stability and could be used in at least five sequential batches. In another case, whole-cell biocatalysts for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production were developed by overexpressing glutamate decarboxylase (GAD; EC 4.1.1.15). GADs from different species were expressed and screened, and the enzyme from Lactococcus lactis was chosen. The gene gadAB was subsequently deleted from the genome of the E. coli host to prevent the degradation of GABA. As a result, 614.15 g/L GABA was produced with a high molar yield (over 99%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In this case, the engineered whole-cell biocatalyst stabilizes the enzyme and reduces the degradation of the product under the reaction conditions.</p><p xml:id="_7ufdCSw">Proline-4-hydroxylase, which catalyses the biotransformation of l-proline to trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Hyp), is a 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent oxygenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. The proline-4-hydroxylase gene from Dactylosporangium sp. RH1 was overexpressed in a putA-deficient E. coli mutant that cannot degrade l-proline. The co-substrate 2-OG, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, was supplied by glucose via the central carbon metabolism of the cells. Hyp was accumulated to a final concentration of 41 g/L with a productivity of 0.41 g/L/h <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In this case, using the recombinant strain as whole-cell biocatalyst avoided the extrinsic addition of the expensive co-substrate 2-OG. In whole-cell biocatalysis for 2-OG production, l-glutamate oxidase (LGOX) catalyzes the transformation of l-glutamic acid to 2-OG along with the production of NH 3 and H 2 O 2 . In order to remove H 2 O 2 , catalase was co-expressed with l-glutamate oxidase, which substantially enhanced the efficiency of 2-OG production. 77.4 g/L 2-OG with a conversion rate of 98.5% was obtained in 12 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p></div>

The aromatic alcohol 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) is synthesized from l-phenylalanine (l-Phe) via the three-step Ehrlich pathway in yeast and via the phenylacetaldehyde synthase (PAAS) pathway in plants. The reconstitution of the Ehrlich pathway in E. coli introduced the enzymes that perform the necessary decarboxylation and reduction steps into the bacterial cells and resulted in 2-PE production. Approximately 96% of the final product was produced from l-phenylalanine (based on the initial 40 mM l-phenylalanine) using the recombinant E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. In another case, a novel pathway that used the PAAS from Rosa hybrid, a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)dependent enzyme and endogenous alcohol dehydrogenases was introduced into E. coli to produce 2-PE. This biotransformation, which was based only on internal de novo PLP synthesis, produced 0.34 g/L 2-PE <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p xml:id="_KXcDPrj">The construction of de novo biosynthetic pathways denotes the assembly of genes from different nonrelated organisms to construct artificial pathways in the desired host. This approach enables retrosynthetic pathway design and opens the door to the development of unprecedented multistep biocatalysts. The seven-step metabolic pathway from glucose-6-p to N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) in bacteria has been identified. Although researchers have tried to metabolically engineer a corresponding E. coli strain, only 1.5 g/L Neu5Ac was obtained by fermentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In contrast, a de novo two-step biosynthetic pathway for Neu5Ac was designed and assembled in a single E. coli strain; this new pathway co-expressed GlcNAc 2-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.8, AGE) from cyanobacteria and Neu5Ac aldolase (EC 4.1.3.3, NanA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> or Neu5Ac synthase (EC 4.1.3.19, NeuB) from bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Whole-cell biocatalysts were developed for Neu5Ac production by assembling a heterologous biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. Ishikawa et al. constructed a recombinant E. coli N18-14 by overexpressing genes of GlcNAc 2-epimerase (slr1975) and neuB resulting in a yield of 53 g/L of Neu5Ac (2.41 g/L/h) after 22 h <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.

For example, Neu5Ac is the precursor of polysialic acid (PSA) and sialylated oligosaccharides.

Systematic modification of targets within central metabolic pathways was conducted to promote the redistribution of metabolic fluxes towards MEPdependent carotenoid biosynthesis. The flux to the EMP pathway was rewired towards the ED/PP pathways by knocking out phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI). Tweaking the flux at the branch point between ED and PP by overexpressing eda and fine-tuning gnd expression in a PGI-deficient strain (Δpgi) improved the G3P/Pyr supply and rebalanced precursor availability, which relieved the bottleneck. Further improvements in DXS expression led to efficient use of G3P and pyruvate in the MEP pathway and significantly increased productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.

These reactions require 2-OG, which undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form succinate, as a co-substrate. However, 2-OG is normally metabolized via the TCA cycle, and thus little flux normally goes into the synthesis pathway of the desired product. To address this problem, An elegant strategy had been developed by by constructing a modified TCA cycle that changed the role of 2-OG from co-substrate to cofactor and then regenerated it (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.

However, it is possible to construct a "bridge" between an amino acid and a structurally equivalent fusel alcohol by using glutamate dehydrogenase.

What is more, efficient whole-cell biocatalysts can increasingly be rationally designed. The present work reviews strategies for the metabolic engineering of whole-cell biocatalysts based on the well-established E. coli platform. As described above, advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology have markedly improved the productivities and yields of products that are synthesized using whole-cell biocatalysts.</p><p xml:id="_cudj87K">Despite the advantages outlined in this article, there are certain limitations that should be considered. The mass transport barrier that the cell membrane represents is one limitation. Cells often have a specific system to transport compounds in or out of the cell. Enhancing the transport system may help the transportation of substrates and products. Another method that can be used to improve substrate transfer across cell walls and membranes is to increase their permeabilization level by chemical means. However, these methods may damage the cell integrity and cause leakage of cellular components, complicating downstream process engineering; therefore, the best conditions for permeabilizing cells should be determined. Second, metabolic engineering strategies that are used in rational strain design involve the overexpression, deletion or down-regulation of genes in their native metabolic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>. However, a precise control of native gene expression levels is important for cell growth. Total deletion or overexpression of metabolic branches can sometimes result in poor growth and thus in poor biocatalyst expression, especially when the targets are in the central metabolic pathways. Several recent studies aimed at overcoming these limitations have focused on the experimental and theoretical advantages that are associated with the dynamic control of enzyme levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. For example, a molecular switch for the dynamic control of gene expression is expected to activate target gene expression in the cell growth phase and deactivate it in the bioconversion stage.

However, challenges still remain when whole-cell biocatalysis uses glucose as a substrate for fine chemical production. Although cells are in a resting state in the conversion stage, the enzymes of central metabolism are still active; thus, the introduced biosynthesis pathways compete with the native enzymes of the central pathways for substrates and energy. Metabolically engineering targets in the central metabolic pathways would affect cell physiology and lead to fluctuations in cell growth.
